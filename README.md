# professor-profiler
The profiler tool gives a holistic profile of a graduate school professor including his personal information, tags based on the research areas being worked on by him/her and ratings/reviews given by past students in the classes taught by him/her. This project is geared towards assisting prospective graduate students in choosing which graduate schools to apply to or professors they would like to do research collaboration with after getting admitted to a particular school. On a more broad level, the tool helps to locate and track the work being done by research experts in a particular specialty (for example: machine learning).
