       "  'abstract': 'The concept of radius of investigation is fundamental to well test analysis and is routinely used to design well tests and to understand the reservoir volume investigated. The radius of investigation can also be useful in identifying new well locations and planning, designing and optimizing hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It has additional implications in estimating reserves and understanding stimulated reservoir volumes. There are many definitions of radius of investigation in the literature and Kuchuk (2009) summarized them recently. Although these definitions vary in detail, they all relate to the propagation of a pressure disturbance or impose thresholds on detectable pressure or rate changes. In this article we will focus on the definition proposed by Lee (1982). Lee defines the radius of investigation as the propagation distance of the “peak” pressure disturbance for an impulse source or sink. For simplified flow geometries and homogeneous reservoir conditions, the radius of investigation can be calculated analytically. However, such analytic solutions are severely limited for heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, particularly for unconventional reservoirs with multistage hydraulic fractures. Generalization of the Concept How can we generalize the concept of radius of investigation to heterogeneous reservoir conditions including unconventional reservoirs with horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fractures? For such general situations, it will be more appropriately called “the depth of investigation” rather than the radius of investigation. The simplest, not necessarily the most desirable, approach will be to use a numerical reservoir simulator. For example, we can simulate a constant rate drawdown test and observe the pressure response at every grid block in the simulation model. It is as if, we have distributed sensors throughout the reservoir. We can now compute the time derivative of the pressure at each grid block and note the time when the derivative reaches a maximum. We can then simply contour this “peak” arrival time at every grid block. Note that because the constant rate test corresponds to a step function (from 0 to Q), its derivative is an impulse function. Thus, by contouring the arrival time of the maximum of the pressure derivative, we are actually looking at the arrival time of the maximum of an impulse response as defined by Lee (1982). How well does the approach work? Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the radius of investigation for homogeneous radial flow using Lee’s analytic solution. Fig. 1b shows the radius of investigation obtained from numerical simulation. We have superimposed the analytic solution (black lines) on the results from the numerical simulation. We do see a close correspondence, although the numerical results have difficulties resolving the pressure transients away from the well. In spite of its limitations, the numerical approach is very general and can be applied to arbitrary reservoir and well conditions. The computation time and expenses, however, make the numerical simulation approach unfeasible for routine applications. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The effective strategies for traditional manual history matching commonly follow a structured approach with a sequence of adjustments from global to regional parameters followed by local changes in model properties, associated with matching for pressure (reservoir energy), flood front progression, and individual well performance. In contrast, many of the automatic history matching methods utilize parameter sensitivities or gradients to directly update the fine-scale reservoir properties, potentially combining elements at all of these scales. In this paper we present a hierarchical streamline-assisted history matching approach that emulates the traditional structured procedures. First, a probabilistic approach is used to understand the uncertainty in the large-scale static and dynamic parameters, and to calibrate these global parameters. In this global calibration, the intent is to develop multiple models that all match the field performance. This global calibration is followed by a streamline sensitivity-based deterministic model calibration for local permeability changes in which each of the distinct models created in the global match are history matched in additional detail. In the probabilistic global calibration, design of experiments and response surface methodologies with evolutionary algorithms are used to calibrate the global parameters. Typical parameters are regional pore volume multipliers, regional vertical and areal transmissibility multipliers, fault transmissibilities and aquifer strength. Key global parameters are first identified via a sensitivity analysis and an initial ensemble of models that span these parameters is created. The cases studied in this sensitivity analysis are used to construct a proxy model using experimental design and response surface analysis. An improved genetic algorithm with heat-bath sampling is used to generate an updated ensemble of models conditioned to static MDT pressures and total liquid rates at the wells, corresponding to a traditional pressure history match. Next, each ensemble member is updated using water-cut, GOR and flowing BHP via sensitivity-based local permeability calibration. We utilize streamline-derived analytic sensitivities to determine the spatial distribution and magnitude of these local changes. The proposed approach was tested by a 3D synthetic case and a field application. Our hierarchical approach appears to be stable in the sense that the local changes for permeability (inner loop) do not invalidate the pressure history match (outer loop). This is not entirely unexpected since the local permeability changes are regularized by a norm constraint that minimizes deviations from the globally updated model. Nonetheless, this is a very useful property in that it allows us to powerfully combine history matching procedures on global and local scales. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Waterflood optimization by means of rate control is receiving considerable attention because of increasing deployments of smart well completions and i-field technology. The use of inflow control valves (ICVs) allows us to optimize the production/injection rates of various segments along the wellbore, thereby maximizing sweep efficiency and delaying water breakthrough. Field-scale rate-optimization problems, however, involve highly complex reservoir models, production and facility constraints, and a large number of unknowns. In this paper, we propose an approach that is computationally efficient and suitable for large field cases. It is based on our previous work (Alhuthali et al. 2007, 2008), which relies on equalizing arrival time of the waterfront at all producers to maximize the sweep efficiency. We use streamlines to efficiently and analytically compute the sensitivity of the arrival times with respect to well rates. We also account for geologic uncertainty by means of a stochastic optimization framework using multiple realizations. Analytical forms for gradients and Hessian of the objective functions are derived, making our optimization computationally efficient for large-scale applications. Finally, optimization is performed under operational and facility constraints using a sequential quadratic programming approach. We demonstrate our approach using two field-scale examples. The first is a synthetic example called \"Brugge\" field, a benchmark case based on a North Sea Brent-type field. The production optimization of this field is carried out as part of a closed-loop process where the production history is matched prior to the production optimization. The production optimization is performed over multiple realizations for 20 years and involves 30 wells equipped with three ICVs per well. The second example is a super-giant Middle Eastern field that has more than 50 years of historical oil production. The optimization is performed for 20 years on a portion of this field that contains nearly 300 wells consisting of conventional vertical and horizontal wells and smart horizontal wells. In both examples, multiple field-related constraints are imposed, such as the maximum well injection and production rates, the maximum allowable drawdown, restriction on high-water-cut wells, and voidage replacement for pressure maintenance. The results clearly demonstrate the viability of our approach and the benefits of optimal rate control, with a considerable increase in cumulative oil production and a substantial decrease in the associated water production.

       "  'abstract': 'History matching and optimization problems often involve several, potentially conflicting, objectives. For example, we might seek to minimize a misfit function involving differences in reservoir pressure, multiphase production history and 4D time-lapse seismic data and these differences do not always change in tandem. It is a common practice to treat these differences as a single objective optimization problem by aggregating all objectives into a scalar function (weighted-sum), resulting in incomplete exploration of the solution space. The problem is particularly severe if the objectives are conflicting. In this paper we propose to use a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) focusing on finding a set of optimal solutions called Pareto optima. The MOEA makes direct use of the dominance relation for fitness assignment instead of a fitness score in one-dimensional objective space. The dominance concept can define levels of optimality without reduction of objective dimensionality to sort populations accordingly, and the given populations constitute typically several ranks (fronts) of classification for individuals. Because it uses a population of solutions in the search process and optimizes such that the ranks are minimized, the Pareto optima can provide a measure of uncertainty in prediction. We show how the MOEA identifies optimal solutions by examining the trade-off between multiple objectives from a set of plausible solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that it outperforms the commonly used weighted-sum approach. For practical applications, we provide a novel history matching workflow with a grid connectivity-based transformation (GCT) basis coefficients as parameters for calibration using the gradient-free evolutionary optimization algorithms. The basis functions are obtained from a spectral decomposition of the grid connectivity Laplacian and avoid ad hoc redefinitions of regions while preserving the geologic heterogeneity. We demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed workflow using multiple examples. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field application for matching production and seismic data with uncertainty and conflicting information. '},\n",

Consequently, fracture parameters (conductivity and half length), fracture location and distribution are the dominant factors influencing well drainage volumes and shale gas well performance. Stimulated reservoir volume or SRV, estimated from microseismic event clouds or rate/pressure transient analysis, describes a measurement of overall reservoir volume impacted by fracture treatments. With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement.  In this paper, we first introduce a novel approach for computing well drainage volume for shale gas wells with multistage fractures and fracture clusters. Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated. The proposed approach has been applied to a generic shale gas well designed after a real field case. The results clearly indicate the benefits of including SRV during history matching, leading to improved fracture/matrix parameter estimation and performance forecasting. Our proposed approach provides an important tool that can be used to optimize well placement, fracture treatments and improve the economics of shale gas plays.

       "  'abstract': 'Unconventional reservoirs are characterized by sufficiently low permeabilities so that the pressure depletion from a producing well may not propagate far from the well during the life of a development. This is in contrast to conventional plays where the pressure transients may probe the entire reservoir in weeks to months. The concept of depth of investigation and its application to unconventional reservoirs provide the understanding necessary to describe and optimize the interaction between complex multi-stage fractured wells, reservoir heterogeneity, drainage volumes, pressure depletion, well rates, and the estimated ultimate recovery.  Previous studies have performed unconventional reservoir analysis using more conventional reservoir simulation techniques. High resolution local PEBI grids and global corner point grids have been used to represent complex fracture geometry and conductivity and estimate subsequent well performance. However, these techniques do not provide the more geometric understanding provided by the depth of investigation and drainage volumes.  The application of the depth of investigation to heterogeneous reservoirs can be obtained from an asymptotic expansion of the diffusivity equation leading to the Eikonal equation which describes the propagation of the pressure front. This equation is solved using a Fast Marching Method to calculate a diffusive time of flight at every location within the domain. The diffusive time of flight is directly related to pressure front propagation. Unlike in a reservoir simulator, this frontal propagation is determined in a single non-iterative calculation, which is extremely fast. Once the pressure fronts are determined spatially, we may apply a pseudo-steady state pressure approximation within the moving front to determine pressure depletion and well rates.  In the current study, we extend the Fast Marching Method for solution of the Eikonal equation to complex simulation grids including corner point and unstructured grids. This allows the rapid approximation of reservoir simulation results without the need for flow simulation, and also provides the time-evolution of the well drainage volume for visualization. Understanding the drainage volume alone is useful for well spacing and multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. Additional potential applications include well trajectory and hydraulic fracture location optimization, reservoir model screening and ranking, matrix/fracture parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and production data integration.

Although the analytic tools require many simplified assumptions, numerical-simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not provide the more-geometric understanding derived from the depth-of-investigation (DOI) and drainage-volume calculations. We propose a novel approach for rapid field-scale performance assessment of shale-gas reservoirs. Our proposed approach is dependent on a high-frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and serves as a bridge between simplified analytical tools and complex numerical simulation. The high-frequency solution leads to the Eikonal equation (Paris and Hurd 1969), which is solved for a “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the “pressure front” in the reservoir. The Eikonal equation can be solved by use of the fast-marching method (FMM) to determine the DTOF, which generalizes the concept of DOI to heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs. It provides an efficient means to calculate drainage volume, pressure depletion, and well performance and can be significantly faster than conventional numerical simulation. More importantly, in a manner analogous to streamline simulation, the DTOF can also be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3D diffusivity equation to a 1D equation, leading to a comprehensive simulator for rapid performance prediction of shale-gas reservoirs.

A sensitivity study is first performed to systematically identify the “heavy hitters” affecting the well performance. This is followed by history matching and an uncertainty analysis to identify the fracture parameters and the stimulated-reservoir volume.

Introduction Unconventional resources are playing an increasingly important role in energy supply worldwide, especially in the United States. To estimate reservoir properties and optimize hydraulic fracture design in unconventional reservoirs, well test analysis (pressure transient and rate transient analysis) is widely used. In the area of well test analysis (Gringarten 1984, 2010; Ehlig-Economides 1992), the concepts of radius of investigation (Lee 1982; Raghavan 1993) and depth of investigation (Datta-Gupta et al. 2011) are fundamental to estimate reserves, understand drainage volume and identify infill drilling location (Kang et al. 2011). These concepts can also be used in unconventional reservoirs to help planning horizontal well, optimizing multi-stage hydraulic fractures (Sehbi et al. 2011), and understanding stimulated reservoir volume (Yin et al. 2011). Kuchuk (2009) recently summarized several definitions of radius of investigation. Most of them rely on analytical solutions based on homogeneous or layered reservoirs. However, these analytical solutions have limited applicability and are difficult to generalize to arbitrary reservoir conditions and well locations. \"},\n",

Over the past two decades, advances in computing and the development and implementation of robust algorithms for automatic history matching have considerably reduced the time and effort associated with subsurface characterization and reduced the subjectivity associated with manual model calibration. However, reliable and accurate subsurface characterization continues to be challenging due to the large number of model unknowns to be estimated using a relatively smaller set of measurements. For ensemble-based methods in particular, the difficulties are compounded by the need for a large number of model replicates to estimate sample-based statistical measures, specifically the covariances and cross-covariances that directly impact the spread of information from the measurement locations to the model parameters. Statistical noise resulting from modest ensemble sizes can overwhelm and degrade the model updates leading to geologically inconsistent subsurface models. In this work we propose to address the difficulties in the implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for operational data integration problems. The methods described here use streamline-derived information to identify regions within the reservoir that will have a maximum impact on the dynamic response. This is achieved through spatial localization of the sample-based cross-covariance estimates between the measurements and the model unknowns using streamline trajectories. We illustrate the approach with a synthetic example and a large field-study that demonstrate the difficulties with the traditional EnKF implementation. In both the numerical experiments, it is shown that these challenges are addressed using flow relevant conditioning of the cross-covariance matrix. By mitigating sampling error in the cross-covariance estimates, the proposed approach provides significant computational savings through the use of modest ensemble sizes, and consequently offers the opportunity for use with large field-scale groundwater and reservoir characterization studies.

The pore-size distribution in shale and tight sand reservoirs typically ranges from nanometers to micrometers, resulting in ultralow permeabilities. In such extremely low-permeability reservoirs, desorption and diffusive processes play important roles in addition to heterogeneity-driven convective flows. For modeling shale and tight oil and gas reservoirs, we can compute the well-drainage volume efficiently with a fast marching method (FMM) and by introducing the concept of “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF). Our proposed simulation approach consists of two decoupled steps--drainage-volume calculation and numerical simulation with DTOF as a spatial coordinate. We first calculate the reservoir drainage volume and the DTOF with the FMM, and then the numerical simulation is conducted along the 1D DTOF coordinate. The approach is analogous to streamline modeling whereby a multidimensional simulation is decoupled to a series of 1D simulations resulting in substantial savings in computation time for high-resolution simulation. However, instead of a “convective time of flight” (CTOF), a DTOF is introduced to model the pressure-front propagation. For modeling physical processes, we propose triple continua whereby the reservoir is divided into three different domains: microscale pores (hydraulic fractures and microfractures), nanoscale pores (nanoporous networks), and organic matter. The hydraulic fractures/microfractures primarily contribute to the well production, and are affected by rock compaction. The nanoporous networks contain adsorbed gas molecules, and gas flows into fractures by convection and Knudsen diffusion processes. The organic matter acts as the source of gas.

Specifically, the streamline time of flight from the injectors provides swept volumes for injectors whereas streamline time of flight from producers gives drainage volumes for producers. These quantities can be effectively combined to a ‘total time of flight' to locate the potential regions of unswept and undrained oil in the reservoir. Our approach utilizes a dynamic measure based on the total streamline time of flight combined with static parameters to identify potential locations for infill drilling. Areas having high value of the dynamic measure (sweet spots) are both poorly drained and poorly swept, making them attractive for drilling infill wells.  We show the power and utility of our proposed method on a mature offshore carbonate field in western India. The simulation model was history matched using a hierarchical history matching approach that follows a sequence of calibrations from global to local parameters in coarsened and fine scales. Using our proposed method on the history matched model we obtained a dynamic measure map highlighting areas suitable for drilling infill wells. Finally, we compared the performance of infill wells located using the dynamic measure map with wells located using traditional well placement techniques, for example, oil saturation map from simulation. Our proposed method consistently outperforms the traditional approaches. Subsequent field infill drilling in the field has validated our approach.  Introduction Placement of infill producers and injectors is an important aspect of the overall development strategy of any field. Well placement optimization becomes particularly important in mature fields where new infill wells have to be drilled based on an improved understanding of the reservoir description and performance. There could be a large number of possible candidate locations for new infill wells. To search through and evaluate all the possible locations is not practically feasible, particularly for high resolution geologic models consisting of multimillion cells. In addition, we must account for geologic uncertainty using multiple plausible realizations while deciding on optimal well placement locations. For large-scale field applications, a practical method is needed to mitigate the computational burden associated with the large number of search locations to minimize the number of simulation runs. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': '3-D streamlines provide an effective tool for reservoir management because of their ability to display reservoir flow and well connections in a physically intuitive manner. Streamlines have been extensively used to investigate the interaction between heterogeneity and well patterns and also for rate allocation and pattern balancing. More recently, streamlines have been used in conjunction with constrained optimization techniques for improving waterflood performance via rate control. Field scale rate optimization problems, however, involve highly complex reservoir models, production and facilities constraints and a large number of unknowns, making them inaccessible for routine waterflood management. In this paper we provide a simple and easy to use workflow for waterflood rate optimization using streamline-based flood efficiency maps that display the flux and time of flight distribution amongst producing wells. We demonstrate the use of flood efficiency map to optimize the injection/production rates to maximize waterflood sweep efficiency by equalizing the average time of flight (TOF) amongst the producing wells in regional basis. Our optimization approach is extremely efficient because it relies on simple analytic calculations to compute weighting factors for injection and production rates to minimize the TOF variance amongst producing wells. Because the approach does not rely on formal and complex optimization tools, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale field application. Also, the approach can be used with both streamline and finite difference simulators. For finite-difference simulations, the streamlines and time of flight are derived from the flux field generated by the simulator. Multiple examples are presented to support the robustness and efficiency of the proposed waterflood management scheme. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field application.

One of the benefits of corner-point cells is the ease with which we may represent faulted reservoirs. Each face of a cell may be juxtaposed to two or more cells, depending on the fault throw and the lateral displacements of adjacent cells. Conventional finite-difference approaches routinely include the flux between these cells as \"non-neighbor\" connections. Other examples of non-neighbor or nonstandard connections occur at the boundary of local grid refinement (LGR) or local grid coarsening (LGC) regions where two computational grids come into juxtaposition. In each of these instances, the velocity across the nonstandard faces of a cell will be unevenly distributed according to the non-neighbor fluxes. In contrast, the standard streamline velocity interpolation model (Pollock\\'s scheme) used within a cell assumes that the flux is evenly distributed on each cell face, inconsistent with the non-neighbor connection fluxes. Streamlines traced with such an approach do not have sufficient degrees of freedom to be consistent with the finite-difference fluxes and, consequently, will not follow a physical flow path. We propose a strategy that provides a consistent representation for streamlines and velocities near faults and non-neighbor connections. Our approach is based on a simple local (boundary layer) refinement construction that can be used to honor the fluxes at each face, without affecting the representation of flow within the cell or on any other cell face. The local refinement construction is the simplest extension to three dimensions for faulted reservoir cells that provides consistency with the finite difference flux calculation. Several examples will be presented for a single pair of cells juxtaposed across a fault and at LGR boundaries to illustrate the difficulties in conventional tracing algorithms and the benefits of our approach. The practical utility of our algorithm is demonstrated in a structurally complex and heavily faulted full-field model. The reservoir geometry includes multiple cells with complex fault juxtaposition and several non-neighbor configurations in different faces.

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract Horizontal well technology is now considered a standard completion practice in unconventional gas reservoirs. With significant improvements in the drilling and completion technology, many tight gas and shale gas prospects have become economically viable. Optimizing location, distribution and the number of stages of hydraulic fractures is an important issue in tight gas reservoir completions, particularly for horizontal and complex wells.  The paper presents a fast approach to optimizing well completions in tight gas reservoirs using a rigorous semi-analytic computation of well drainage volumes in the presence of multiple stages of hydraulic fractures. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front' in the reservoir along gas streamlines. The proposed approach is a generalization of the radius of drainage concept in well test analysis (Lee, 1982). The streamlines are computed from the pressure and velocity distribution derived from finite difference simulation. This makes the approach completely general and capable of handling complex spatial reservoir heterogeneity and arbitrary well conditions. Furthermore, the streamline approach is visual, intuitive and allows us to examine the interactions between the hydraulic fractures, reservoir heterogeneity and the implications on the drainage volumes and EUR calculations.  A field example is presented to demonstrate the application of our approach by optimizing well completions in a horizontal well recently drilled in the Cotton Valley formation. We first apply the proposed drainage volume calculations to an existing vertical well and identify its ‘region of influence' along with the potential interference from the proposed horizontal well. We then apply the drainage volume concept to the proposed horizontal well and examine the effects of different number of hydraulic fracture stages. The combined drainage volumes from the vertical and horizontal well are calculated as a function of the number of fracture stages to determine the point of diminishing return and to optimize the number of fracture stages. The results are found to be consistent with independent analysis based on rate profiles from numerical simulation and NPV calculations.  Introduction Hydraulic fracture treatment and horizontal well drilling technologies have become an integral part of the exploitation and development of tight gas reservoirs. These enabling technologies have spurred the development of unconventional resource base mainly consisting of tight gas sands, coal bed methane and shale gas. Hydraulic fracturing technology has evolved tremendously in the last decade in North America as a result of synergies derived from various functional and cross-functional groups. Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing treatments and other fracture diagnostic methods have enabled greater understanding of the nature of the formation being stimulated. As a result, a greater portion of the ‘Resource triangle' for natural gas is now being accessed and the ‘Resource' base is being converted by consistent application of these technologies to ‘Reserves' (Holditch and Madani, 2010). \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'History matching problems are typically underdetermined and are at once confronted with the problems of solution non-uniqueness, instability, and the ability to both reproduce field observations and provide a reliable forecast. We address these challenges with a new adaptive multiscale history matching formulation that parameterizes the reservoir properties in the frequency domain. The geologic model updating is carried out by successively increasing the level of detail up to a spatial scale sufficient to match the observed data. Our method begins by constructing a coarse representation of the field using the lowest-frequency components of its discrete cosine parameterization. This substantially reduces the number of unknown parameters to be resolved during history matching, leading to a better posed inverse problem. A gradient-based minimization is then performed to match the production data. Next, the updated model is incrementally refined in the frequency domain and the minimization is repeated until the data misfit is reduced below a pre-specified criterion or until no further improvements are observed. During minimization, components of the gradient insensitive to production information are removed by a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), facilitating iterative convergence and providing additional regularization. In this manner a balance is achieved between parameter reduction which is required for stability, and the spatial resolution of heterogeneity required for reproduction of the production history. The low-frequency approximation of the permeability field helps to honor geologic continuity and is particularly suited for resolving the large-scale heterogeneity that has a dominant influence on the field-scale flow regime and production response. Applications of the approach are demonstrated using the SPE10 and PUNQ-S3 models and involve waterflood history matching with water-cut and bottom-hole pressure data. Our results show that the principle geologic features of the reference field are adequately resolved only if we begin at low resolution. As the resolution is iteratively increased, the history match is improved while the TSVD step removes insensitive parameter combinations thereby decreasing the likelihood of convergence to less plausible local minima. Notably, in all our applications an adequate history match is achieved using less than 1% of the original parameter dimension, which leads to increased solution stability and computational savings in history matching large geologic models.

For example, we can compute and visualize the time evolution of the well drainage volume for multimillion cell geologic models in seconds without resorting to reservoir simulation. A geometric approximation of the drainage volume is then used to compute the well rates and the reservoir pressure. The speed and versatility of our proposed approach makes it ideally suited for parameter estimation via inverse modeling of shale gas performance data. We utilize experimental design to perform the sensitivity analysis to identify the ‘heavy hitters' and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the relevant fracture and matrix parameters in shale gas reservoirs by history matching of production data.

The proposed approach is applied to a fractured shale gas well. The results clearly show reduced uncertainty in the estimated fracture parameters and SRV, leading to improved forecasting and reserve estimation. Introduction Shale gas production has become an important share of U.S. energy supply, driven to a large extent by the advances in horizontal well completion technology and multistage hydraulic fracturing. To reliably estimate shale gas reserves and ultimate recoveries, it is important to predict shale gas well performance accounting for the relevant reservoir and fracture parameters. Currently decline curve analysis (Fetkovich 1980; Valko and Lee 2010) and pressure/rate transient analysis (Ilk et al. 2010; Song and Ehlig-Economides 2011; Clarkson et al. 2012) are two types of widely used analytical methods for production forecasting in shale gas well development. The methods in decline curve analysis are largely curve-fitting used to forecast production via extrapolation and obtain the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). In pressure/rate transient analysis, fracture properties are first estimated from identified flow regimes and then well production is predicted with the estimated properties. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Understanding how pressure fronts propagate (diffuse) in a reservoir formation is fundamental to welltest analysis and reservoir drainage volume estimation. We have developed an alternative approach to the solution of the 3-D diffusivity equation by directly solving the propagation equation for the \"pressure front\" defined as the maximum pressure response for an impulse source. The pressure front equation is a form of the Eikonal equation, which is a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and whose properties are well developed in the literature. Most importantly, the Eikonal equation can be solved very efficiently by a class of solutions called the Fast Marching Methods (FMM) for a \"diffusive time of flight\" (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the \"pressure front\" in the reservoir. The \"diffusive time of flight\" can be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3-D diffusivity equation into an equivalent 1-D formulation, leading to a simplified method for rapid reservoir modeling. Recent papers have explored the utility of this 1-D approach for performance prediction using finite difference numerical simulation. The method is especially well suited to the interpretation of the drainage volume, which is of great help in well spacing calculations and in the context of unconventional reservoirs, multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. In this paper we introduce an analytic solution technique for the diffusivity equation, which provides a direct relationship between production data and the reservoir drainage volume. The analytic formulation provides for the direct calculation and extension of many simple well test, rate transient and well performance concepts such as depth of investigation, welltest derivative, drainage volume, flow regimes and well productivity. As with other analytic approaches, these solutions allow superposition in space and in time, which allows for the solution for multiple wells, multiple flow rates, and bounded and composite reservoirs. We validate our approach against well-known solutions in pressure and rate transient analysis usually solved in Laplace space, including pressure transients with wellbore storage and skin. Our study demonstrates that the new approach yields results very close to the known solutions calculated via numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, and indicates how to extend these solutions to problems with heterogeneity and complex fractured well geometry.

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract We present a method for history matching and uncertainty quantification for channelized reservoir models using Level Set Method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our objective is to efficiently sample realizations of the channelized permeability fields conditioned to the production data and facies observation at the wells. In our approach, the channel field boundary is first described by a level set function, e.g., a signed distance function or any other indicator function. By solving the level set equation (motion in a prescribed direction), we are able to gradually move the channel boundaries and evolve the channelized reservoir properties. Our approach allows representing facies via a parameterization of the velocity field that deforms the interface. Thus facies can be parameterized in the space of smooth velocity fields. The dimension reduction can be achieved for covariance-based velocity fields by re-parameterizing with SVD techniques.  After parameterization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is utilized to perturb the coefficients of principal components of velocity field to update channel reservoir model matching production history. One advantage of this approach is that it is easy to condition the channel model to the facies observations at well locations by constraining the random velocity field to zero at well locations. To speed up the computation and improve the acceptance rate of the MCMC algorithm, we employ two stage methods where coarse-scale simulations are used to screen out the undesired proposals. The MCMC algorithms naturally provide multiple realizations of the permeability field conditioned to well and production data and thus, allow for uncertainty assessment in the forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the level set MCMC algorithm using both 2D and 3D examples involving waterflood history matching.  Introduction In many geologic environments, the distribution of subsurface properties is primarily controlled by the location and distribution of distinct geologic facies with sharp contrasts in properties across facies boundaries (Weber, 1982). For example in a fluvial setting, high permeability channel sands are often embedded in a nearly impermeable background causing the dominant fluid movement to be restricted within these channels. Under such conditions, the orientation of the channels and channel geometry play an important role in determining the flow behavior in the subsurface. Thus, in predicting the flow through highly heterogeneous porous formations, it is important to model facies boundaries accurately and to properly account for the uncertainties in these models.  The representation and history matching of channelized reservoirs are challenging because of the difficulties to reproduce the large-scale continuity of the channel structure and identify the channel geometry and its orientation. The traditional twopoint geostatistical techniques for reservoir characterization are unable to reproduce the channel geometry and the facies architecture (Dubrule, 1998; Haldorsen and Damsleth, 1990; Koltermann and Gorelick, 1996). As an alternative, object-based modeling (Deutsch and Wang, 1996) and more recently, multi-point geostatistical methods (Caers and Zhang, 2004; Strebelle and Journel, 2001) have been used to represent the channel structure for dynamic data history matching.

       "  'abstract': 'Inverse problems associated with reservoir characterization are typically under-determined and often have difficulties associated with stability and convergence of the solution. A common approach to address this issue is through the introduction of prior norm constraints, smoothness regularization or reparameterization to reduce the number of estimated parameters. We propose a dual scale approach to production data integration that relies on a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale inversions while preserving the essential features of the geologic model. To begin with, we sequentially coarsen the fine-scale geological model by grouping layers in such a way that the heterogeneity measure of an appropriately defined ‘static’ property is minimized within the layers and maximized between the layers. Our coarsening algorithm results in a non-uniform coarsening of the geologic model with minimal loss of heterogeneity and the ‘optimal’ number of layers is determined based on a bias-variance trade-off criterion. The coarse-scale model is then updated using production data via a generalized travel time inversion. The coarse-scale inversion proceeds much faster compared to a direct fine-scale inversion because of the significantly reduced parameter space. Furthermore, the iterative minimization is much more effective because at the larger scales there are fewer local minima and those tend to be farther apart. At the end of the coarse-scale inversion, a fine-scale inversion may be carried out, if needed. This constitutes the outer iteration in the overall algorithm. The fine-scale inversion is carried out only if the data misfit is deemed to be unsatisfactory. We demonstrate our approach using both synthetic and field examples. The field example involves waterflood history matching of a structurally complex and faulted offshore turbiditic oil reservoir. Permeability and fault transmissibilities are the main uncertainties. The geologic model consists of more than 800,000 cells and 10\\xa0years of production data from 8 producing wells. Using our dual scale approach, we are able to obtain a satisfactory history match with a finite-difference model in less than a day in a PC. Compared to a manual history matching, the dual scale approach is shown to better preserve the geological features and the pay/non-pay juxtapositions in the original geologic model. '},\n",

With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement. In this paper, we first introduce a novel approach for computing well drainage volume for shale gas wells with multistage fractures and fracture clusters. Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated.

       "  'abstract': 'The successful development of unconventional reservoir relies on the massive hydraulic fractures which provide high conductive paths and large contact area between matrix and wellbore. Since well production always shows a steep decline after the early high flow rate, refracturing can be an economically promising option to compensate for the loss of production and improve the well delivery. Although extensive field cases have been published on refracturing practice, there is a lack of guidelines on how to select and optimize refracturing design. In this paper, a series of synthetic cases are used to evaluate the well performance under different refracturing designs. The key characteristics for refracturing simulation is accurate quantification of the depletion-induced stress and pressure field change. Thus, finite element method is used to solve the coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model while a cohesive zone model is adopted to simulate the fracture propagation. A viscoelastic model is used to simulate the time-dependent fracture conductivity change due to proppant embedment. The synthetic cases are grouped into two categories: refracturing in existing perforations and in newly created perforations. A systematic sensitivity study is performed on the effects of fracturing spacing, matrix permeability and refracturing time. Numerical results show different fracture configurations for refracturing in depleted and virgin reservoirs and thus demonstrate the importance of accounting for stress and pressure changes during initial production. Refracturing the existing perforation is likely to create a wider but shorter fracture compared to the virgin case because the fracturing fluid in these fractures encounter less resistance for enlarging fracture width rather than fracture length because of reduced pressure and total stress. Refracturing new perforations appears to give better short-term performance than refracturing existing perforations but worse long-term performance. Simulation results indicate that for relatively low permeability reservoir it is favorable to add more fracture area; however, the advantage is diminished while for relatively high permeability reservoir where the SRV might already be depleted. When proppant degradation is severe, and fracture conductivity is the limiting factor for production, refracturing existing perforations becomes more attractive. Moreover, simulation results seem to indicate an optimum time window exists for refracturing in this scenario. '},\n",

In the past, models and methodologies have been developed for fracture diagnosis for multiple-stage-fractured horizontal wells. They are based either on a semianalytical approach for simplicity or on reservoir simulation for generality. The challenges are that semianalytical models are not robust enough to describe complex fracture systems, whereas numerical simulation is computationally expensive and impractical for inversion. To develop a comprehensive approach to translate temperature to flow profile, we adopted the fast marching method (FMM) in simulating both heat transfer and the velocity/pressure field in the interested domain (heterogeneous reservoir with multiple-fractured horizontal wells). FMM is a new approach that is efficient in front tracking. Previous studies show a significant success in the investigation of pressure-depletion behavior and shale-gas production-history match. By the nature of heat transfer in porous media, the thermal-front propagation would lag behind pressure, and the noticeable temperature change in the reservoir only happens near hydraulic/natural fractures. FMM can be used to efficiently track the heat front that is associated with the flow field. In this study, we solve the thermal model in porous media by transforming the general energy-balance equation into a 1D equation, with the diffusive time of flight (DTOF) as the spatial coordinate system. Besides the diffusive heat conduction, the convection, Joule-Thomson effect, and viscous dissipation are considered in the model. The inner boundary of the model is carefully handled, and the drainage volume of each fracture is calculated to identify different inflow temperature related to flow rate at perforation locations. The model was validated by the finite-difference approach. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the application of the new method.

Characterization of reservoir heterogeneity typically begins with the conceptual geologic model and the identification of regional attributes such as facies or depositional sequences, domain boundaries and boundary conditions, and faults or other sources of regional hydraulic (dis)continuity. Finer-scale patterns of heterogeneity within regional features may then be populated and updated when appropriate. Accordingly, research and field application together have emphasized the establishment of reservoir engineering workflows that systematically reconcile the geologic model, from the regional to gridcell scale, with multiresolution static and dynamic data. Related approaches to both manual and assisted history matching typically apply a structured approach and employ a series of data integration algorithms that are each suited to the scale of the estimated features and the type and resolution of the available data (Landa and Horne, 1997; Williams et al., 2004; Caers, 2003; Yin et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2008). Approaches following this parsimonious rationale integrate data such as 3D/4D seismic, formation testing of pressure, pressure transient analysis and production phase cuts in a step-wise sequence, beginning at the global scale and often with the most simple description, followed by an attempt to update finer-scale details only when supported by the data or by related reservoir management decisions.

       "  'abstract': 'History matching problems are typically underdetermined and can have problems with uniqueness and stability of the solution and preserving geologic realism which is critical for a reliable forecast of not only future production but also the distribution of bypassed hydrocarbon in the reservoir. We propose a new adaptive multi-stage history matching formulation that parameterizes the reservoir properties in the frequency domain where the geologic model updating is carried out by successively increasing the level of detail up to a spatial scale sufficient to match the observed data. The method begins by constructing a coarse representation of the field using the lowest-frequency components of its discrete cosine parameterization. This substantially reduces the number of unknown parameters to be resolved during history matching. A gradient-based minimization is then performed to match the production data. Next, the updated model is incrementally refined in the frequency domain and the minimization is repeated until the data misfit is reduced below a pre-specified criterion. During minimization, components of the gradient insensitive to production information are removed by truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), facilitating iterative convergence and providing additional regularization. In this manner a balance is achieved between parameter reduction which is required for stability, and the spatial resolution of heterogeneity required for reproduction of the data. The low-frequency approximation of the field helps to honor geologic continuity and is particularly suited for resolving the large-scale heterogeneity that has a dominant influence on the production response. Applications of the approach are demonstrated using the SPE10 and PUNQ-S3 models and involve waterflood history matching with water-cut and bottom-hole pressure data. Our results show that the principle geologic features of the reference field are adequately resolved only if we begin at very low resolution. As the resolution is iteratively increased, the history match is improved while the TSVD step automatically removes insensitive parameter combinations that can result in convergence to a local minimum. Notably, in all our applications an adequate history match is achieved using less than one percent of the original parameter dimension, which leads to increased solution stability and computational savings in history matching large geologic models. Introduction The history matching of geologic models is an important step in the development of field operation strategies and production forecasting. It is well known that the integration of observed data into a reservoir model involves a highly underdetermined and ill-posed inverse problem that results in non-unique and potentially unstable solutions. The solution or updated reservoir model must also cohere with multiple types of data consisting of static, dynamic and more qualitative geologic descriptions so that geologic consistency is maintained during model updating. Further, when applying an iterative descent method with an under-determined problem, it is likely for the solution to be trapped in one of the many local minima. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'We present an efficient history matching approach that simultaneously integrates 4-D repeat seismic surveys with well production data. This approach is particularly well-suited for the calibration of the reservoir properties of high-resolution geologic models because the seismic data is areally dense but sparse in time, while the production data is continuous in time but averaged over interwell spacing. The joint history matching is performed using streamline-based sensitivities derived from either finite-difference or streamline-based flow simulation. Previous approaches to seismic data integration have mostly incorporated saturation effects but the pressure effects have largely been ignored. We propose, for the first time, streamline-based analytic approaches to compute parameter sensitivities that relate the seismic data to reservoir properties while accounting for both pressure and saturation effects via appropriate rock physics models. The inverted seismic data (e.g., changes in acoustic impedance or fluid saturations), is distributed as a 3-D high-resolution grid cell property or as a vertically integrated two-dimensional map. We derive pressure drop sensitivities along streamlines in addition to our previous work of water saturation sensitivity computation. The novelty of the method lies in the analytic sensitivity computations which make it computationally efficient for high resolution geologic models. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing it in a finite difference simulator which incorporates detailed physical processes, while the streamline trajectories provide for rapid evaluation of the sensitivities. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated with both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is the SPE benchmark Brugge field case. The field example involves waterflooding of a North Sea reservoir with multiple seismic surveys. For both the synthetic and the field cases, the advantages of incorporating the time-lapse variations are clearly demonstrated through improved estimation of the permeability distribution, pressure profile, and fluid saturation evolution and swept volumes.

       "  'abstract': 'Streamlines have been very effectively used for computing swept volumes and drainage volumes in oil reservoirs. However, there is an incorrect but commonly held perception that streamlines cannot be used for gas reservoirs. In fact, streamlines exist whenever there is an underlying velocity field—both in compressible and incompressible flow. In this paper we present one of the first applications of streamlines to tight gas reservoirs for drainage volume calculations of producing wells, optimal placement of infill wells. Current practice of well placement in tight gas reservoirs generally involves the use of empirical correlations based on reservoir properties and past production histories and/or pressure maps from flow simulation. No rigorous procedure is available to compute well drainage volumes in the presence of heterogeneity and hydraulic fractures, particularly for complex wells. We propose a fast approach for drainage volume calculations based on the streamlines and diffusive time of flight and demonstrate its application to optimize well placement. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front’ in the reservoir. This allows us not only to rigorously compute the well drainage volumes as a function of time, but also to examine the potential impact of infill wells on the drainage volumes of existing producers. Using these results, we present a systematic approach to optimize well placement to maximize the estimated ultimate recoveries (EUR). We demonstrate the power and utility of our method using both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is used to validate our approach by establishing the consistency between the drainage volume calculations from streamlines and the EUR. The field example is from the Wamsutter gas field, one of the largest gas fields in the Rocky Mountain region. We utilize the streamline-based drainage volumes to identify depleted sands and generate a reservoir quality map to optimize future well placement based on the undepleted regions. Field application clearly demonstrates a systematic and efficient approach to optimal well placement in tight gas reservoirs. '},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has gained increased popularity for history matching and continuous reservoir-model updating. It is a sequential Monte Carlo approach that works with an ensemble of reservoir models. Specifically, the method uses cross covariance between measurements and model parameters estimated from the ensemble. For practical field applications, the ensemble size needs to be kept small for computational efficiency. However, this leads to poor approximations of the cross covariance and can cause loss of geologic realism from unrealistic model updates outside the region of the data influence and/or loss of variance leading to ensemble collapse. A common approach to remedy the situation is to limit the influence of the data through covariance localization. In this paper, we show that for three-phase-flow conditions, the region of covariance localization strongly depends on the underlying flow dynamics as well as on the particular data type that is being assimilated in terms of water cut or gas/oil ratio (GOR). This makes the traditional distance-based localizations suboptimal and, often, ineffective. Instead, we propose the use of water- and gas-phase streamlines as a means for covariance localization for water-cut- and GOR-data assimilation. The phase streamlines can be computed on the basis of individual-phase velocities which are readily available after flow simulation. Unlike the total streamlines, phase streamlines can be discontinuous. We show that the discontinuities in water-phase and gas-phase streamlines naturally define the region of influence for water-cut and GOR data and provide a flow-relevant covariance localization during EnKF updating. We first demonstrate the validity of the proposed localization approach using a waterflood example in a quarter-five-spot pattern. Specifically, we compare the phase streamline trajectories with cross-covariance maps computed using an ensemble size of 2,000 for both water-cut and GOR data. The results show a close correspondence between the time evolution of phase streamlines and the cross-covariance maps of water-cut and GOR data. A small-size industrial reservoir engineering production forecasting with uncertainty quantification (the PUNQ-S3) (Carter 2007) model application shows that our proposed localization outperforms a distance-based localization method. The updated models show improved forecasts while preserving geological realism. '},\n",

Modeling of unconventional reservoirs requires accurate characterization of complex flow mechanisms in multi-continua because of the interactions between reservoir rocks, microfractures and hydraulic fractures. It is also essential to account for the complicated geometry of well completion, the reservoir heterogeneity and multi-phase flow effects. Currently, such multi-phase numerical simulation for multi-continua reservoirs needs substantial computational time that hinders efficient history matching and uncertainty analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for field scale application and performance assessment of shale reservoirs using rapid multi-phase simulation with the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The key idea of the reservoir simulation using the FMM is to recast the 3-D flow equation into 1-D equation along the ‘diffusive time of flight’ (DTOF) coordinate, which embeds the 3-D spatial heterogeneity. The DTOF is a representation of the travel time of pressure propagation in the reservoir. The pressure propagation is governed by the Eikonal equation which can be solved efficiently using the FMM. The 1-D formulation leads to orders of magnitude faster computation than the 3-D finite difference simulation. The use of FMM-based simulation also enables systematic history matching and uncertainty analysis using population-based techniques that require substantial simulation runs. We first validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the FMM-based multi-phase simulation using synthetic reservoir models and comparison with a commercial finite-difference simulator. Next, we apply our proposed approach to a field example in Texas for a multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal well. The 3-D heterogeneous reservoir model was built and history matched for oil, gas and water production using the Genetic Algorithm with the FMM-based flow simulation. Multiple history-matched models were obtained to examine uncertainties in the production forecast associated with respect to the properties related to hydraulic fractures, microfractures and the matrix.

Parameter updates are constrained to the prior geologic heterogeneity and are performed parsimoniously, or only to spatial scales that can be resolved by the historical data. In the first step of the workflow, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to calibrate and assess the uncertainty in global parameters (e.g., regional fracture properties, aquifer strength) that influence reservoir energy and field-scale flow behavior. To identify the reservoir volume over which each parameter region is applied, a novel heterogeneity segmentation technique is developed from spectral clustering theory. After an ensemble of calibrated model realizations is identified using the GA, the ensemble is reduced via a cluster analysis to define a variance-preserving subset of the members for the second step of local, higher-resolution parameter calibration. Each member of the subset is calibrated to well-level phase rate and pressure data using a sensitivity-based scheme. To improve the ill-posedness of each high-resolution inverse problem, the heterogeneity field is parameterized in the spectral domain using the Grid Connectivity-based Transform (GCT) to provide a compressed representation that captures only the sensitive geologic trends. The GCT concurrently imposes geological continuity during calibration and promotes minimal changes to each prior ensemble member. The proposed calibration workflow is applied to a structurally complex, fractured reservoir located offshore Peru. The reservoir is modeled as dual porosity and single permeability (DPSP). In the global calibration step, the field water production rates, gas rates and average reservoir pressure are matched using the GA together with zonal multipliers that represent spatial variation in aquifer strength, fracture porosity and a matrix–fracture coupling parameter. In the subsequent local step, the well-by-well production histories are matched through calibration of the most uncertain grid-cell parameter, fracture permeability, which is characterized using the GCT parameterization. The final calibrated models are consistent with geologic interpretation and are currently being applied for field development strategies. '},\n",

In CCS projects, the time-lapse seismic survey has been proposed as a valuable tool for monitoring of CO2 movement. However, the potential of the time-lapse seismic data for heterogeneity characterization and geologic model updating has not been fully explored. One of the biggest challenges in the quantitative use of time-lapse seismic data during CCS is the complex movement of the CO2 influenced by compositional effects, geochemical reactions, phase changes and gravity segregation.  In this paper, we first introduce compositional streamlines to understand and visualize the flow and transport of CO2 in the presence of mineral precipitation/dissolution, residual trapping and buoyancy effects. To start with, individual component fluxes are generated by a finite difference fully implicit compositional simulator incorporating all the relevant physics of CO2 sequestration. The fluxes are then utilized in novel streamline tracing algorithms to generate phase and component streamlines depicting the movement and the trapping of CO2 in the aquifer. Next, we utilize the compositional streamlines to determine the sensitivity of the time-lapse seismic attributes specifically, interpreted saturation differences, to changes in reservoir properties such as permeability and porosity. The sensitivities are then used in an inverse modeling algorithm to calibrate the geologic model to time-lapse seismic data. The outcome is an improved description of permeability heterogeneity that is consistent with the 4-D seismic response and improved predictions of the CO2 storage capacity.  We have investigated the benefits of time-lapse seismic data integration in improving the performance assessment of CO2 sequestration using examples involving CO2 injection under realistic conditions. The first example examines the value of the 4-D seismic data integration in the estimation of storage capacity. The second example systematically studies the impact of viscous to gravity ratio on the performance of time-lapse seismic monitoring and heterogeneity characterization during CCS.  Introduction Carbon sequestration in brine aquifers faces many different challenges in both engineering and economical aspects. There are several sources of uncertainties associated with the injection of CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Engineering problems such as the leakage of CO2 can compromise the integrity of fresh waters, ecosystems and the health of populations exposed to high concentration of CO2 (Ha-Duong, 2003; Gasda et al., 2004). There are also economic threats associated with legal disputes and fines imposed by regulatory agencies.  Monitoring, verification and accounting (MVA) are the activities directed to determine the location of the injected CO2 and the presence of possible leaks in order to provide public assurance. Many techniques have been developed for monitoring the performance of CO2 injection projects and the migration of CO2 in geologic formations. Time lapse seismic surveillance data is one of the most mature and effective techniques for monitoring changes in the fluid saturation and pressure and has been extensively used by the oil industry.  The viability of time lapse seismic data as a monitoring tool has been investigated in laboratory and field experiments (Wang and Nur 1989; Wang et al 1998; Korneev et al 2004; Hovorka et al 2006; Daley et al 2007). The characteristics of seismic responses under the complex compositional and geochemical interactions of the injected CO2 in geologic formations have been modeled by Kumar et al. (2008).

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract Flow simulation of multimillion grid cell models with hundreds of wells and decades long production history can be extremely time-consuming. This often limits the applicability of assisted history matching techniques. A pragmatic solution to this problem is grid coarsening which is now embedded in many commercial reservoir simulators.  Instead of up-scaling geological models in external packages, grid cells are automatically amalgamated within the simulator while preserving flux distribution and reducing the total number of active cells. The resulting speedup can be significant, often only at small loss of accuracy. Both characteristics are essential elements of any inversion technique in a multimillion grid cell environment. For water-flood history matching, we have utilized a commercial finite-volume simulator and the streamline-based generalized travel time inversion whereby water-cut behavior is matched by adjusting inter-well permeabilities.  To apply the assisted history matching technique on high resolution models, a flux reconstruction method is devised which makes full use of the benefits of automatic grid coarsening. It approximates fluxes in the original geological grid by recalculating transmissibility at the fine scale and redistributing coarse scale fluxes accordingly. The inversion is thus conducted on the fine scale grid, while the forward simulation model uses the coarse grid. While solving for an inexpensive coarse model, the calibration takes into account fine grid resolution. Upscaling is not required and the degree of coarsening can be adjusted during the matching process.  The proposed method was successfully tested on a supergiant carbonate oilfield with about hundred wells and large-scale water injection. The history match improved dramatically at relatively low numerical cost, which also allowed for investigating multiple sensitivities. The results were verified against non-coarsened model. The significant increase in efficiency makes this a potential method of choice for cases, where previously assisted history matching techniques could not be deployed due to excessive run times.  Introduction Multimillion grid cell models are frequently used in reservoir simulation. But these models, which very often have a significant number of wells and decades long production history, pose the problem of long simulation run times. The complexity of such models result in a large number of model parameters which is not only related to the problem of non uniqueness but also to the significant computational expense of deriving sensitivities of model parameters to production response which is a prerequisite in any optimization technique (Stenerud et al. ,2008).  To evaluate sensitivities of global parameters, coarsened or upscaled simulation models can be useful as they can significantly reduce simulation runtimes which is vital for deriving efficient parameter sensitivities (Mamanov et al., 2007; Jong et al., 2010). They are also more suitable than proxy response surfaces constructed using experimental design techniques as they are directly derived from the non-coarsened or non upscaled simulation input models. In our convention, simulation model running with grid coarsening will be referred to as coarsened models and normal simulation model will be referred to as non-coarsened model. '},\n",

Multi-stage transverse fracture treatments provide significant reservoir stimulation, but recent industry study estimates that as high as one third fracture clusters are not performing as expected. This is due to the complexity of the fracture and reservoir characteristics and large number of possible design variables, such as the number of transverse fracture stages, the fracture spacing, horizontal well length, proppant concentration, and the fluid and proppant injection history. A systematic and efficient fracture design procedure is needed to provide a more optimal design. This paper focuses on the optimization of the number of fracture stages, their spacing, and the allocation of proppant during multistage hydraulic fracturing. Our optimization will rely on a novel approach for drainage volume calculations using a Fast Marching Method (FMM). The FMM is a recently introduced method that relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation to extend the concept of depth of investigation to heterogeneous and fractured media. The approach has been shown to be computationally efficient, physically intuitive and can rigorously account for the interactions between the hydraulic and natural fractures during the computation of drainage volume. Our optimization approach will attempt to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) from the engineering perspective, by selecting the optimal number and placement of fracture stages. Optimum fracture spacing need not necessarily be uniformly distributed along the horizontal wellbore, especially when prior reservoir properties, for example natural fracture density, are available from well logs and other sources. A systematic and efficient approach to fracture design will be demonstrated, constrained by long-term well performance while accounting for specific economic parameters. The power and practical utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a three-dimensional synthetic example. We find that there are an optimum number of fracture stages for a given reservoir. If adequate geological, geophysical, and engineering data are available to estimate reservoir heterogeneity before hydraulic fracturing, fracturing spacing can be further optimized instead of evenly spaced. If there is uncertainty associated with reservoir heterogeneity, multiple realizations can be integrated in the proposed optimization workflow. '},\n",

The sensitivities relate the changes in arrival time to small perturbations in reservoir properties and can be obtained efficiently with the streamline-based approach with a single flow simulation. This makes the approach particularly wellsuited for high-resolution reservoir characterization. Finally, the sensitivities are used in conjunction with an iterative inversion algorithm to update the reservoir models with existing and proven techniques from seismic tomography.

The impact is particularly pronounced for compositional simulations that require numerous flash calculations. This paper presents the development of a 3D 3-phase compositional streamline simulator and its application to field-scale CO2 injection. The novel aspect of our approach is the ability to incorporate gravity and capillary effects into compositional streamline simulation without adversely impacting its computational efficiency. In our approach, we use an orthogonal projection method to reformulate the streamline transport equations so that the fluxes of capillary and gravity are separated into components parallel and orthogonal to the total velocity defining the streamline trajectories. Fluxes parallel to total velocity are included within the solution of the convective flow equations on streamlines. The remaining terms are calculated on the underlying three dimensional grid. Because the size of the remaining transverse flux correction terms is significantly reduced, we are able to take large time steps. The ability to effectively incorporate transverse fluxes in streamline transport calculations will be a step change in streamline simulation in general. We demonstrate that our proposed treatment of transverse fluxes allows us to efficiently study high resolution migration of CO2 in the subsurface with potential applications to both improved oil recovery as well as carbon sequestration.

Thus an unstructured grid, instead of a Cartesian or corner point grid, is preferred to accurately model the geometry of the fractures and the performance of such reservoirs. The drawback of conventional simulation on unstructured grids is the potentially heavy computational cost. A novel approach has recently been introduced to provide rapid simulation of unconventional reservoirs, which first captures the drainage volume during the transient propagation process using the Fast Marching Method (FMM) and then rapidly solves fluid flow equation in an equivalent 1D domain. However, this application is currently limited to calculating the reservoir response with Cartesian or corner-point grids. In this study, the FMM based simulation method is extended to unstructured grid. A new mesh generation approach is first presented to discretize the complex fracture network, accounting for both hydraulic fractures and natural fractures. Voronoi cells (or perpendicular bisector, i.e. PEBI grids) are constructed with high resolution near the fractures and with larger cells far from fractures. A force-equilibrium algorithm is adopted here to optimize the mesh quality and reduce highly skewed cells. FMM algorithm is computed on the basis of subdivided triangles, which can provide the diffusive time of flight (DToF) at both Voronoi cell vertices and cell centers. Thus, a more accurate calculation of drainage volume in unconventional reservoir with complex fracture networks can be obtained. Finally, fluid flow is calculated in transformed 1D domain, where DToF acts as the 1D spatial coordinate. Unstructured grids with good mesh quality are constructed to accurately capture the complex fracture network system. The convergence characteristic of FMM on unstructured grids is investigated. Reservoir simulation is efficiently computed based on the drainage volume information from the unstructured grid system using FMM, and the simulation results are validated with finite-difference based and finite-volume based numerical results. There are three key parts of this proposed approach, which are: (i) good mesh generation technique to capture complex fracture networks, (ii) FMM computation on unstructured grids to provide the drainage volume, and (iii) fluid flow calculation in transformed 1D domain. We extend the reservoir simulation using FMM in unconventional reservoirs from Cartesian and corner point grid systems to unstructured grids. The proposed approach shows orders of magnitude reduction in simulation time for modeling unstructured grids, bringing typical simulation times of hours or days down to minutes, which is quite attractive for high-resolution models.

The results show that with only production history matching without distributed data along the wellbore, the water entry location in horizontal wells can not be detected satisfactorily. Combining production history matching with the temperature distribution in the wellbore, we can get an improved geological model that can match the production history and also, locate the water entry correctly. Based on the downhole flow conditions and the updated geological model, we can now optimize the well performance by controlling the inflow rate distribution, such as shutting the high water inflow sections.  Introduction Horizontal wells are now routinely applied as part of the oil and gas field development strategy. Inferring reservoir and downhole flow conditions are important aspects of production and recovery optimization of horizontal wells. The commonly used method to obtain downhole flow conditions is production logging, and more recently, downhole temperature and pressure sensors become a valuable addition for accessing downhole flow conditions. Many studies have been presented in analyzing these data for production optimization. Alaeddin and Maizeret (2003) used production logging technology to evaluate the contribution of two horizontal legs and possible water entry locations. This information can help to manage reservoir for optimizing the re-development plan of the field. Alhuthali et al. (2007) provided an optimal waterflood reservoir management by rate control. Their results show that the correct rate control for horizontal well with ICV completions can delay the water breakthrough time and significantly increase the reservoir recovery. Real time production data is also used for optimizing oil recovery in multilateral wells (Alghareeb et al., 2009). Based on the production history data and reservoir permeability distribution, an optimum ICV configuration can be obtained so as to minimize water cut and maximize net present value. \"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Abstract We introduce a novel reservoir parameterization approach to mitigate the challenges associated with field-scale history matching. In this approach, the reservoir property field is mapped to and updated in a low-dimensional transform domain using a linear transformation basis. The transformation basis vectors are the eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix that is constructed using grid connectivity information and the main features in a given prior model. Because the grid connectivity information is computed only within a small multi-point stencil, the Laplacian is always sparse and is amenable to efficient decomposition. The resulting basis functions are ordered from large to small scale and include prior-specific spatial features. Therefore, the variability in reservoir property distribution can be effectively represented by projecting the property field onto subspaces spanned by an increasing number of leading basis vectors, each incorporating additional heterogeneity features into the model description. This property lends itself to a multiscale history matching algorithm where basis elements are sequentially included to refine the heterogeneity characterization to a level of complexity supported by the resolution of data. While the method can benefit from prior information, in the extreme case where reliable prior knowledge is not available the transformation reduces to a discrete Fourier expansion with model-independent parameterization properties.  We present the derivation and theoretical justification of the proposed method and review its important properties for reservoir parameterization including efficient one-time construction of the basis prior to calibration, applicability to any grid geometry and strong compression performance. The multiscale history matching algorithm begins by updating the prior reservoir model using a parameterized multiplier field that is superimposed onto the grid and assigned an initial value of unity at each cell. The multiplier is sequentially refined from the coarse to finer scales during minimization of production data misfit. This method permits selective updating of heterogeneity at locations and levels of detail sensitive to the available data, otherwise leaving the prior model unchanged as desired. We successfully apply the parameterization approach to history match several reservoir models, including a field case, using an adaptive multiscale algorithm.  Introduction The calibration of geologic reservoir model heterogeneity to production data is an integral part of reservoir engineering workflows that ultimately contribute to reservoir management and field development decisions. Regardless of the conceptual approach taken to reservoir model calibration (e.g., structured [Landa and Horne, 1997; Williams et al., 1998; Yin et al., 2010], parsimonious [Grimstad et al., 2003; Doherty, 2005; Mannseth, 2006; Bhark et al., 2011c] or high-resolution [Vasco et al., 1997; Vasco et al., 1999; Muffels et al., 2006]), a pervasive component in nearly all approaches is a form of parameter or model reduction as a method of regularization by which the difficulties of the under-determined inverse problem of dynamic data integration become more tractable. Either through grid construction or through characterization of the estimable properties at grid cell resolution, the intent of parameterization is necessarily to construct a low dimensional representation of the geologic system, characterizing only those features important to the flow and transport processes studied, by exploiting both the inherent spatial associations of geologic properties and the general insensitivity of dynamic data, production data in particular, to finer scale detail.

       "  'abstract': 'We present a probabilistic approach for integrating multiple data into subsurface flow models. Our approach is based on a Bayesian framework whereby we exhaustively sample the multi-dimensional posterior distribution to define a Pareto front which represents the trade-off between multiple objectives during history matching. These objectives can be matching of water-cut, GOR, BHP and time-lapse seismic data. For field applications, these objectives do not necessarily move in tandem because of measurement errors and also interpretative nature of the seismic data. Our proposed method is built on a Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DEMC) algorithm in which multiple Markov Chains are run in parallel. First, a dominance relationship is established amongst multiple models. This is followed by construction of the posterior distribution based on a hypervolume measure. A unique aspect of our method is the proposal selection which is based on a random walk on two arbitrarily selected chains. This promotes effective mixing of the chains resulting in improved convergence. We illustrate the algorithm using a nine-spot waterflood model whereby we use water-cut and bottomhole flowing pressure data to calibrate the permeability field. The permeability field is reparameterized using a previously proposed Grid Connectivity Transform (GCT) which is defined based on a decomposition of the grid Laplacian. The compression power of GCT allows us to reconstruct the permeability field with few parameters, thus significantly improving the computational efficiency of the MCMC approach. Next, we applied the method to the Brugge benchmark case involving 10 water injectors and 20 producers. For both cases, the algorithm provides an ensemble of models all constrained to the history data and defines a probabilistic Pareto front in the objective space. Several experimental runs were conducted to compare the effectiveness of the algorithm with NonDominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA). Higher hypervolume was constantly measured using our algorithm which indicates that more optimal solutions were sampled. Our method provides a novel approach for subsurface model calibration and uncertainty quantification using MCMC in which the communication between parallel Markov chains enhances adequate mixing. This significantly improves the convergence without loss in sampling quality. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can efficiently integrate seemingly conflicting data into reservoir models while quantifying uncertainties. Besides reservoir model calibration, we expect that the algorithm will find application in probabilistic production optimization problems as well. '}}"
