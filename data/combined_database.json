The Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) process, a metal based additive manufacturing technique, can locally deposit dissimilar metal powders to produce FGM parts. Yet inappropriate mixing ratio of materials without considering the influence of dilution and overlapping effects among layers and tracks and the variation of material properties can result in inaccurate material composition in the fabricated parts when compared to the desired compositions. Within such a context, this paper proposes a design method that links the process parameters to the desired composition of the part based on mathematical models. The proposed scheme is illustrated through a case study of fabricating an iron-nickel FGM part with three-dimensional composition variation. Using the proposed method, the process parameters can be planned prior to the manufacturing process, and the material distribution deviation from the desired one can be reduced. "

Improving the predictivity of macroscale predictions by means of multiscale algorithms relative to classical at-scale models is the primary motivation for the development of multiscale simulators. Yet, very few are the quantitative studies that explicitly address the predictive capability of multiscale coupling algorithms as it is still generally not possible to have a priori estimates of the errors that are present when complex flow processes are modeled. We develop a nonintrusive pore-/continuum-scale hybrid model whose coupling error is bounded by the upscaling error, i.e. we build a predictive tightly coupled multiscale scheme. This is accomplished by slightly enlarging the subdomain where continuum-scale equations are locally invalid and analytically defining physics-based coupling conditions at the interfaces separating the two computational sub-domains, while enforcing state variable and flux continuity. The proposed multiscale coupling approach retains the advantages of domain decomposition approaches, including the use of existing solvers for each subdomain, while it gains flexibility in the choice of the numerical discretization method and maintains the coupling errors bounded by the upscaling error. We implement the coupling in finite volumes and test the proposed method by modeling flow and transport through a reactive channel and past an array of heterogeneously reactive cylinders. "

In this work, we perform a set of drainage and imbibition experiments in six identical microfluidic cells to study the reproducibility of multiphase flow experiments. We observe significant variations in the experimental results, which are smaller during the drainage stage and larger during the imbibition stage. We demonstrate that these variations are due to sub-porescale geometry differences in microcells (because of manufacturing defects) and variations in the boundary condition (i.e., fluctuations in the injection rate inherent to syringe pumps). Computational simulations are conducted using commercial software STAR-CCM+, both with constant and randomly varying injection rates. Stochastic simulations are able to capture variability in the experiments associated with the varying pump injection rate. "

The system\u2019s behavior is fully controlled by P\u00e9clet (Pe) and three Damk\u00f6hler (Daj,j={1,2,3}) numbers, which quantify the relative importance of the four key mechanisms involved in the transport process, i.e. advection, molecular diffusion, homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. We use multiple-scale expansions to upscale the pore-scale system of equations to the macroscale, and establish sufficient conditions under which macroscopic local advection\u2013dispersion\u2013reaction equations (ADREs) provide an accurate representation of the pore-scale processes. These conditions reveal that (i) the heterogeneous reaction leads to more stringent constraints compared to the homogeneous reactions, and (ii) advection can favorably enhance pore-scale mixing in the presence of fast reactions and relatively low molecular diffusion. Such conditions are summarized by a phase diagram in the (Pe,Daj)-space, and verified through numerical simulations of multicomponent transport in a planar fracture with reacting walls. Our computations suggest that the constraints derived in our analysis are robust in identifying sufficient as well as necessary conditions for homogenizability. "

Most numerical multiscale models, which seek to combine these two descriptions, require empirical closures and/or assumptions about the behavior of pore-scale quantities at the continuum (Darcy) scale. We present a general formulation of an iterative hybrid numerical method that links the pore and continuum scales without resorting to such approximations. The algorithm treats the fluxes exchanged at the internal boundaries between pore- and continuum-scale domains as unknown, and allows for iteratively determined boundary conditions to be applied at the pore-scale in order to guarantee flux continuity. While the algorithm proposed is general, we use it to model transport in a fracture with chemically reactive walls. Results demonstrate significant improvement upon standard continuum-scale formulations. "

                    "abstract": "To reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 to the atmosphere, sequestration in deep saline aquifers is a viable strategy. Residual trapping is a key containment process important to the success of CO2 storage operations. While residual trapping affects CO2 migration over large scales, it is inherently a pore-scale process. Pore-network models (PNMs), capturing such processes, are useful for our understanding of residual trapping, and for upscaling trapping parameters for larger scale models. A PNM for simulation of quasi-static two-phase flow; CO2 intrusion (drainage) followed by water flooding (imbibition) was developed. It accounts for pore-scale displacement mechanisms, and was used to investigate residual CO2 trapping. The sensitivity of the residual CO2 saturation to several parameters was studied, to validate a trapping behavior in agreement with earlier studies. Then the PNM was calibrated to core sample data and used to simulate drainage-imbibition scenarios with different turning point saturations. From these the initial-residual saturation curves of CO2 in Heletz sandstone were estimated, essential for future macroscopic-scale simulations. Further, the occurrence of different pore-scale mechanisms were quantified and the size distribution of the residual clusters was shown to exhibit a bimodal appearance. The findings improve the understanding of residual trapping in Heletz sandstone. "

Application of medical imaging to experimentally quantify these processes has led to significant progress in material characterization and understanding fluid transport behavior at laboratory scales. While widely utilized in cancer diagnosis and management, cardiology, and neurology, positron emission tomography (PET) has had relatively limited applications in earth science. This study utilizes a small-bore micro-PET scanner to image and quantify the transport behavior of pulses of a conservative aqueous radiotracer injected during single and multiphase flow experiments in two heterogeneous Berea sandstone cores. The cores are discretized into axial-parallel streamtubes, and using the reconstructed micro-PET data, expressions are derived from spatial moment analysis for calculating sub-core tracer flux and pore water velocity. Using the flux and velocity measurements, it is possible to calculate porosity and saturation from volumetric flux balance, and calculate permeability and water relative permeability from Darcy\u2019s law. Second spatial moment analysis enables measurement of sub-core solute dispersion during both single phase and multiphase experiments. A numerical simulation model is developed to verify the assumptions of the streamtube dimension reduction technique. A variation of the reactor ratio is presented as a diagnostic metric to efficiently determine the validity of the streamtube approximation in core and column-scale experiments. This study introduces a new method to quantify sub-core permeability, relative permeability, and dispersion. These experimental and analytical methods provide a foundation for future work on experimental measurements of differences in transport behavior across scales. "

Previous observations have highlighted the importance of subcore-scale capillary heterogeneity in developing local saturations during drainage; we show in this study that the same is true for the imbibition process. Spatially distributed drainage and imbibition scanning curves were obtained for mm-scale subsets of the rock sample non-invasively using X-ray CT imagery. Core- and subcore-scale measurements are well described using the Brooks\u2013Corey formalism, which uses a linear trapping model to compute mobile saturations during imbibition. Capillary scaling yields two separate universal drainage and imbibition curves that are representative of the full subcore-scale data set. This enables accurate parameterisation of rock properties at the subcore-scale in terms of capillary scaling factors and permeability, which in turn serve as effective indicators of heterogeneity at the same scale even when hysteresis is a factor. As such, the proposed core-analysis workflow is quite general and provides the required information to populate numerical models that can be used to extend core-flooding experiments to conditions prevalent in the subsurface, which would be otherwise not attainable in the laboratory.

The purpose of this research was to measure, at core scale, the change in reservoir permeability and capillary pressure due to MICP during seal formation, then to monitor the integrity of the seal when exposed to acidic groundwater capable of causing dissolution. The experiment was carried out with a Berea sandstone core mounted in a high pressure core holder within a medical X-ray CT scanner. Multiple full volume CT scans gave spatially resolved maps of the changing porosity and saturation states throughout the experiment. Porosity and permeability decreased with MICP whilst capillary pressure was increased. Dissolution restored much of the original porosity, but not permeability nor capillary pressure. This lead to the conclusion that injection pathways were coupled with carbonate precipitation hence preferential flow paths sealed first and transport of the dissolution fluid was limited. Provided a high enough reduction in permeability can be achieved over a substantial volume, MICP may prove to be a durable bio-grout, even in acidic environments such as a carbon sequestration reservoir.

These injection strategies are applied to four different oil types to evaluate recovery and storage potentials. Enhanced oil recovery is very effective with 40\u00b0 API oil, achieving ultimate field recoveries of 80.63 percent for constant CO2 injection and 63.77 percent for alternating CO2 injection. CO2 injection is far less effective for heavier oils. Constant CO2 injection generally produces more oil than alternating injection, given the greater amount of CO2 injected. When controlling for total CO2 injected, however, the two injection methods produce oil equally well. The alternating injection method is more efficient at storing CO2 than the constant injection method for the same quantity of CO2 injected across all oil types. For 40\u00b0 API oil, the alternating method is as high as 16 percent more efficient, the best of all four oils examined. The increased storage efficiency coupled with the lack of additional oil production indicates that CO2 is finding space for storage by displacing water accumulated during an initializing water-flood. Evidence of significant water displacement by CO2 supports the legitimacy of the long term goal of CO2 sequestration into saline aquifers. "

The experimental data is then used to build a multiphase, multicomponent 3D simulation model in order to confirm and validate the experimental results.

Exsolved gas distributions are measured on Domengine and Boise sandstone samples using synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography. Observed gas phase distributions are compared to a new model that simulates the growth and distribution of exsolved gas phase at the pore-scale. Water relative permeability curves are calculated using a Stokes flow simulator with modeled and observed gas distributions, under various conditions, such as rock geometry, and pressure depletion rates. By comparing the actual bubble distributions with modeled distributions, we conclude that exsolved gas is more likely to form and accumulate at locations with higher water velocities. This suggests that convective delivery of CO2 to the gas bubble is a primary mechanism for bubble growth, as compared to diffusive transport through the aqueous phase. For carbonated brine flowing up a fault at half a meter per day, with 5% exsolved gas, the water relative permeability is estimated to be 0.6\u223c0.8 for various sandstones. The reduction of water mobility reduces upward brine migration when even a small amount of exsolution occurs. "

Capillary pressure distributions among the population of trapped ganglia were investigated by calculating interfacial curvature in order to assess the potential for remobilization of residually-trapped non-wetting ganglia due to differences in capillary pressure presented by neighbor ganglia. For each sample, sintered glass beads, Boise sandstone and Fontainebleau sandstone, sub-volumes with different voxel sizes were analyzed to quantify air/brine interfaces and interfacial curvatures and investigate the effect of image resolution on both fluid phase identification and curvature estimates. Results show that the method developed for interfacial curvature estimation leads to reliable capillary pressure estimates for gas ganglia. Higher resolution images increase confidence in curvature calculations, especially for the sandstone samples that display smaller gas-brine interfaces which are then represented by a higher number of voxels when imaged with a micron or sub-micron voxels size. The analysis of sub-volumes from the Boise and Fontainebleau dataset highlights the presence of a residually-trapped gas phase consisting of ganglia located in one or few pores and presenting significantly different capillary pressures, especially in the case of Fontainebleau sandstone. As a result, Ostwald ripening could occur, leading to gas transfer from ganglia with higher capillary pressure to surrounding ganglia with lower capillary pressures. More generally, at the pore-scale, most gas ganglia do present similar capillary pressures and Ostwald ripening would then not represent a major mechanism for residually-trapped gas transfer and remobilization.

Both vehicle types can facilitate the integration of intermittent renewables. H2 generation and storage infrastructure to support FCEVs is a promising opportunity for synergy between the transportation and building sectors in renewables integration, through grid storage and Power2Gas (i.e. blending H2 into the natural gas supply). However, as FCEVs also require more than twice as much electric energy per distance traveled than BEVs, an integrated analysis is necessary to evaluate which electric vehicle (EV) offers the lowest cost for reducing CO2 emissions. We use an integrated analysis to determine the overall cost and CO2 emissions when BEVs or FCEVs are deployed in two communities in southern Germany. Based on a comprehensive scenario for future cost and technology developments for 2025 and 2035, the cost-optimal mix of energy generation and storage technologies is determined to meet all energy demands (heating, electricity and transportation) in the communities. This integrated analysis finds, that the higher energy consumption of FCEVs could not be compensated by system benefits like Power2Gas and grid storage. The result is consistent with a similar analysis of a community in California. The simulation results reveal, that while the two vehicle types enable similar CO2 emission reductions, these can be realized at lower costs with BEVs than with FCEVs. The most striking observation was, that in the event seasonal H2 grid storage becomes necessary, FCEVs would in fact be less favorable than BEVs, which require less energy per km traveled and therefore leave more energy available for stationary applications.

For instance, battery vehicles might enable peak load shifting and short-term electricity storage when connected to the electric grid. Hydrogen infrastructure that provides refueling of fuel cell vehicles might also absorb peak solar generation, and provide hydrogen to the natural gas network. Here, the cost and emissions impacts of these system-level effects are integrated into an overall cost-benefit analysis of battery vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. An integrated analysis of a community energy system under various electric vehicle penetration scenarios is conducted, using a linear cost optimization model. The model determines the cost-optimal energy infrastructure mix in different penetration rate scenarios, using hourly time series data for the community's power generation and energy demand. The optimization considers a wide variety of technical and economic parameters, and determines results for 2025 and 2035. The findings show, that while both battery vehicles and fuel cell vehicles can modestly reduce the community's overall carbon dioxide emissions, the latter carry higher overall costs, primarily due to the hydrogen generation infrastructure. Battery vehicles are therefore a more cost-efficient choice for reducing CO2 emissions. "

                    "abstract": "In order to ensure safe and effective long-term geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), existing regulations require both assessing leakage risks and responding to leakage incidents through corrective measures. However, until now, these two pieces of risk management have been usually addressed separately. This study proposes a methodological framework that bridges risk assessment to corrective measures through clear and collaborative contingency planning. We achieve this goal in three consecutive steps. First, a probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approach is adopted to characterize potential leakage features, events and processes (FEP) in a Bayesian events tree (BET), resulting in a risk assessment matrix (RAM). The RAM depicts a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of leakage scenarios with quantified likelihood, impact, and tolerance levels. Second, the risk assessment matrix is translated to a contingency planning matrix (CPM) that incorporates a tiered-contingency system for risk-preparedness and incident-response. The leakage likelihood and impact dimensions of RAM are translated to resource proximity and variety dimensions in CPM, respectively. To ensure both rapid and thorough contingency planning, more likely or frequent risks require more proximate resources while more impactful risks require more various resources. In addition, the minimum and maximum risk tolerance levels are translated to contingency thresholds, and all tolerable risk scenarios are categorized under three contingency tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. We highlight how the upper, lower, and inter-tier contingency boundaries should be collaboratively pre-negotiated between the operating party and multiple relevant stakeholders to ensure effective preparedness and response. Finally, we present a model contingency plan to demonstrate how all newly introduced concepts integrate together. Specifically, we focus on explaining how the designed contingency tiers facilitate important aspects of contingency planning, primarily: evaluating leakage and initiating response; designing a corrective measures matrix (CMM) that assigns specific control and remediation measures to each leakage scenario; mobilizing, deploying, and sustaining necessary human and equipment resources; and formulating a decision-making hierarchy, a notification protocol, and a communication scheme to effectively administer the CO2 storage site.

The number of monitoring wells and the total monitoring time is varied in order to determine minimum pressure-monitoring requirements for effective leak characterization. The history-matching procedure uses particle swarm optimization to minimize the error between leakage-model solutions and synthetic observation data by adjusting model parameters governing the size and location of the leak, as well as the heterogeneous permeability field throughout the model. The method applies to storage projects with uncertain heterogeneous geology that may be described by a variogram model. Results from several examples indicate that as little as 6\u201312 months of above-zone pressure monitoring data, collected from at least 3 or 4 wells, may be sufficient to locate and estimate the size of a leak to inform mitigation and remediation strategies. No significant benefit is seen when using multilevel monitoring wells versus single-level monitoring wells. We also find that adding white noise to the synthetic observation data, with magnitude consistent with current pressure monitoring techniques, generally reduces error in solutions, likely due to a regularization effect. Taken in total, the results and procedures introduced in this study should be of use in designing monitoring strategies in large-scale carbon storage projects. "

                    "abstract": "Assuring the storage security of geologically sequestered CO2 is essential for proper project management and long-term emissions reductions. Storage security relies not only on comprehensive site characterization prior to injection and careful reservoir management, but also on having a suite of intervention and remediation strategies available to implement if leakage occurs. In this study sequential stages of intervention are analyzed and evaluated. The first step in halting leakage is likely to be stopping CO2 injection in the vicinity of the leak (also termed passive remediation). Results indicate that while passive remediation can reduce the leakage rate by an order of magnitude, completely stopping leakage may often require implementation of additional measures. Additional measures evaluated here focus largely on hydraulic controls, whereby water is injected or produced in or above the CO2 injection reservoir in order to terminate leakage. The degree of residual trapping determines the extent to which leakage is ultimately reduced. For example, water injection into the overlying aquifer directly above a fault was able to completely terminate leakage for as long as water injection continues. Remediation was even more effective when water injection above the fault was combined with reservoir fluid production. We also show that in addition to hydraulic control methods, extracting 15\u201325% of the injected CO2 can lead to permanent leakage termination. The role of reservoir heterogeneity on remediation efficacy was also examined and found to reduce the total amount of CO2 leaked compared to a homogeneous reservoir. Overall this study demonstrates that temporally limited, multi-stage intervention strategies such as hydraulic barriers can permanently stop CO2 leakage from storage reservoirs into overlying aquifers.

                    "abstract": "Recent advancements in experimental techniques allow sub-core-scale heterogeneities to be quantified in a high resolution. Based on the observations of heterogeneity distributions in natural core samples, we perform simulations to study the influence of small-scale heterogeneities on large-scale CO2\u00a0migration during geological storage. We observe that even the heterogeneities at millimeter scale (the scale of a Representative Elementary Volume for sandstones) can affect large-scale buoyancy-driven upward CO2\u00a0migration. For the representative examples we study, ignoring small-scale heterogeneities can lead to an overestimation of the migration speed by a factor of two. To analyze the cause of such overestimation, we introduce a dimensionless heterogeneity factor to characterize different levels of heterogeneity. The influence on CO2\u00a0migration is quantified with respect to a variety of heterogeneity factors, correlation lengths, and fluid viscosity ratios for isotropic and anisotropic media. Our findings suggest that small-scale heterogeneities should not be ignored in core analysis, even for cores that appear relatively homogeneous and do not have distinguishable heterogeneous patterns. In addition, relative-permeability curves measured from core-flood experiments under high-flow-velocity conditions (a common practice to eliminate capillary end-effects) should not be directly used in modeling low-velocity CO2\u00a0migration if small-scale heterogeneities are present.

                    "abstract": "A recently developed technique to accurately characterize sub-core scale heterogeneity is applied to investigate the factors responsible for flowrate-dependent effective relative permeability curves measured on core samples in the laboratory. The dependency of laboratory measured relative permeability on flowrate has long been both supported and challenged by a number of investigators. Studies have shown that this apparent flowrate dependency is a result of both sub-core scale heterogeneity and outlet boundary effects. However this has only been demonstrated numerically for highly simplified models of porous media. In this paper, flowrate dependency of effective relative permeability is demonstrated using two rock cores, a Berea Sandstone and a heterogeneous sandstone from the Otway Basin Pilot Project in Australia. Numerical simulations of steady-state coreflooding experiments are conducted at a number of injection rates using a single set of input characteristic relative permeability curves. Effective relative permeability is then calculated from the simulation data using standard interpretation methods for calculating relative permeability from steady-state tests. Results show that simplified approaches may be used to determine flowrate-independent characteristic relative permeability provided flow rate is sufficiently high, and the core heterogeneity is relatively low. It is also shown that characteristic relative permeability can be determined at any typical flowrate, and even for geologically complex models, when using accurate three-dimensional models. "

Specifically, steady-state 3D coreflood displacements in heterogeneous cores over a range of relevant conditions are simulated to study the impact of sub-core heterogeneity on CO2/brine displacements over a wide range of flowrates. Various degrees of heterogeneity are generated based on the normal random distribution as well as for real models of cores based on 3D X-Ray tomography. A 2D semi-analytical model considering gravity and permeability heterogeneity is developed for predicting brine displacement efficiency over a wide range of capillary numbers that provides good agreement with the simulated 3D results. The analytical derivation is general and the provided solution can estimate the flow regimes for horizontal core floods efficiently. "

Laboratory measurements of fracture aperture distributions have been made using CT scanning under various conditions of effective stress. By applying the stress-dependent aperture data, numerical simulation is employed to model the change of permeability and capillary pressure in the rock fracture as a function of the effective stress. The stress-dependent aperture distribution data demonstrates that increasing stress results in two effects: (1) the mean aperture will decrease; (2) the variance of aperture distribution will increase. Experimental results show that permeability will drop by 73% when effective stress increases from 0.34MPa to 22.06MPa. As the variance of aperture distribution increases with stress, the plateau area of the capillary pressure curve tends to grow steeper, indicating that capillary behavior changes from more fracture-like to more porous media-like. The impacts of mean and variance of aperture distributions on permeability and capillary pressure are separately analyzed. The mean aperture decrease will reduce permeability and increase entry pressure. The variance increase will reduce permeability, the pore size distribution index and entry pressure. By analyzing the stress-dependent mean and variance of aperture distributions, this paper provides a more straightforward way for estimating stress-dependent permeability and capillary pressure in rock fractures.

This paper presents results from an experimental investigation of hysteresis in residual trapping and relative permeability of CO2 in a CO2/water system at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and 9\u00a0MPa in a Berea sandstone core. Carbon dioxide saturation data were collected using the steady-state method in a horizontal core-flooding apparatus with X-ray computed tomography. Three flooding cycles were completed at a constant total volumetric flow rate by incrementally increasing and decreasing the fractional flow rates of supercritical CO2 and water. The fractional flow rates were chosen such that the maximum CO2 saturation of each cycle was greater than that of the previous cycle. During the injection stage of a cycle, CO2 displaced water in a wetting-phase drainage process (water saturation decrease). Following injection, water displaced CO2 in a wetting-phase imbibition process (water saturation increase). The fractional flow of CO2 was then increased during the next cycle. Results showed the CO2 saturations trapped during wetting-phase imbibition increased with the maximum CO2 saturations reached during each cycle. The residually trapped CO2 saturation is a hysteretic function, depending on the maximum saturation reached by the core before imbibition. A linear model with coefficient 0.5 describes the nonwetting trapping relationship. The experimental relative permeability data for CO2 fit a single bounding primary drainage curve while CO2 saturations increased, but followed three different scanning curves during wetting-phase imbibition. The CO2 relative permeability data can be fit by making a minor modification in the Van Genuchten\u2013Burdine relative permeability data to account for hysteresis. "

In this work, optimal ISCC system design and hourly operations are determined simultaneously using computational optimization procedures. The full optimization problem is intractable, so a series of problem reductions are employed to explore the ISCC design space while ensuring that individual designs can operate feasibly for a wide range of operating conditions and under realistic constraints. We construct bi-objective Pareto fronts for two conflicting objectives: net present value (NPV) and average CO2 emissions intensity of power produced. A variety of ISCC designs are explored to find a superior configuration with physically feasible annual solar contribution (ASC) of up to 20%, a significant improvement over published designs. We then explore the sensitivity of the results to economic factors such as discount rate, power price, and capital cost. By examining the Pareto frontiers of each case, we quantify the economic cost of reduced CO2 emissions. The resulting ISCC-derived mitigation costs are found to be competitive with other CO2 mitigation technologies. "

We compare both traditionally used methods such as k-means, k-medoids, and hierarchical clustering, and shape-based clustering methods such as dynamic time warping and k-shape in the domain of the objective function of sample operational optimization problems. Centroid-based approaches show improved performance as the number of clusters increases, whereas medoid-based approaches do not show a clear pattern as to when they best represent the objective function of the optimization problem of the full representation. Furthermore, clustering based on shape-based algorithms can improve performance compared to the traditionally used algorithms. "

Yet to date, most work on ISCC design has focused on high-level treatments of system viability and potential impact, without thorough consideration of system operations. In this work, a computationally efficient ISCC model is constructed that includes detailed modeling of the heat recovery steam generator that links the natural gas and solar\u00a0thermal systems. The model is validated against a model in the literature, and then used to perform computational optimization of the facility operations. Critically, a wide variety of practical system constraints are considered at each time step evaluated in order to ensure system feasibility under realistic conditions. It is shown that under different operating modes the ISCC design examined displays similar emission rates, yet significantly different profit ranges. A marked increase in the operating flexibility of the ISCC is observed when the outlet temperature of the solar heat transfer fluid is allowed to vary over the course of the day. "

The system consists of a cryogenic air separation unit, liquid oxygen storage, a gas turbine, a heat-recovery steam generator, and a steam turbine. The gas turbine is modeled allowing part-load operation. Computational optimization is used to maximize net present value (NPV) in order to examine the potential benefits achievable through upfront investments in increased flexibility (i.e., allowing price arbitrage between times of low and high price). Case studies of Germany and California are examined. Flexible SCOC-CC systems are not profitable in either region under current electricity prices. With electricity prices \u22482 times current prices, we find systems with positive NPVs. Oxygen storage is used in days with extreme price variability. Optimal designs favor constant operation, without over- or under-sizing system components and without additional oxygen storage. Sensitivity analyses show that external factors such as mean electricity price (\u00b1 200%), natural gas price (\u00b1 150%), and nominal discount rate (\u00b1 50%) have the strongest effect on NPV. Electricity price variability, which is thought to increase with increased penetration of renewables, does not strongly impact system design and profitability. "

Two open-source oil-sector GHG models are applied to a set of 83 representative global oil fields and 75 refinery crude oil streams (representing \u223c25% of global production). Results from these models are used to estimate per-barrel energy intensities (power, heat), which are scaled to generate country-level demand for heat and power. Multiple solar resource quality cutoff criteria are used to determine which regions may profitably use solar. Potential solar thermal capacity ranges from 19 to 44 GWth in upstream operations, and from 21 to 95 GWth in downstream operations. Potential PV deployment ranges from 6 to 11 GWe in upstream operations and 17\u201391 GWe in downstream operations. The ranges above are due to both per-bbl variation in energy intensity, as well as uncertainty in solar resource quality criteria. Potential solar deployment in upstream operations would displace a much smaller fraction of upstream energy use because a large fraction of global upstream energy use is are either offshore or in high latitude regions (e.g., Russia, Canada, Central Asia).

                    "abstract": "The optimized performance of two advanced CO2 capture processes is compared to that of a monoethanolamine (MEA) baseline for a gas-powered CO2 capture retrofit of an existing coal-fired facility. The advanced temperature-swing processes utilize piperazine and mixed-salt solvents. The mixed-salt treatment involves the use of ammonia for CO2 absorption and potassium carbonate primarily to control ammonia slip. The processes are represented in terms of energy duty requirements within a modular heat integration code developed for CO2 capture modeling and optimization. The model includes a baseload coal plant, a gas-fired subsystem containing gas turbines and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and a CO2 capture facility. A formal bi-objective optimization procedure is applied to determine the design (e.g., detailed HRSG components and pressure levels, gas turbine capacity, CO2 capture capacity) and time-varying operations of the facility to simultaneously maximize net present value (NPV) and minimize total capital requirement (TCR), while meeting a maximum CO2 emission intensity constraint. For a realistic scenario constructed using historical data, optimization results indicate that both advanced processes outperform MEA in both objectives, and the mixed-salt process in turn outperforms the piperazine process. Specifically, for the scenario considered, the base case mixed-salt process achieves 16% greater NPV and 14% lower TCR than the MEA process, and 10% greater NPV and 5% lower TCR than the piperazine process. A five-case sensitivity study of the mixed-salt process indicates that it is competitive with the piperazine process and consistently outperforms the MEA process. "

                    "abstract": "We optimize the design and time-varying operation of a CO2-capture-enabled power station burning coal and natural gas, subject to a CO2 emission intensity constraint. The facility consists of a coal-fired power plant and an amine CO2 capture system, which is powered by a combined-heat-and-power auxiliary gas-fired subsystem. The detailed design of the CO2 capture system, the detailed heat integration of the facility, and time-varying operations schedule across all hours of the year are determined in a single optimization problem. This problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear program: objectives include minimizing total capital requirement (TCR) and maximizing net present value (NPV). Because the Aspen Plus model used for the CO2 capture system is too computationally intensive to use directly in optimization runs, we develop a statistical proxy model of the capture system that reproduces Aspen Plus results but is several hundred times faster. The integrated proxy model includes statistical submodels for the CO2 absorption and solvent regeneration blocks, as well as simple physical models of other system components. Incorporating the detailed CO2 capture system in the optimization provides important design information such as the optimal number of CO2 capture trains required. Two scenarios are considered, based on historical data for Texas and India. Results show that the choice of objective function can have a strong effect on planned operating profile (constant or variable operations). Similarly, hourly electricity price variability strongly affects design and plant scheduling. In the West Texas scenario, which has high price variability, the maximum NPV objective favors variable operations, with a CO2 capture system utilization factor of 65.9% (out of a maximum of 85%), while the minimum TCR objective favors constant operations. In contrast, because of low electricity price variability in the India scenario, there is little value in time-shifting the demand for capture heat, so constant operations are favored in this case for both objectives.

This study presents a first engineering-based assessment of the energy intensity of Bakken crude oil production and computes the resulting NER (net energy return) from Bakken hydrocarbon production. The energy required to drill, produce, and process Bakken oil and gas is estimated for over 7000 wells using open-source drilling and production assessment models. The largest energy uses are from drilling and processing of produced fluids (crude/water emulsions and gas). Fluid lifting and injection and embodied energy are also important energy needs. Median energy consumption equals \u22483.4% of net crude and gas energy content, while mean energy consumption equals \u22483.9% of hydrocarbon energy. The median NER is 29.3\u00a0MJ/MJ. The interquartile range is 24.3\u201335.7\u00a0MJ/MJ, while the 5%\u201395% range is 13.3\u201352.0\u00a0MJ/MJ.

                    "abstract": "The Bakken shale and similar formations in North Dakota are a new, poorly characterized resource and the oil production potential of North Dakota is highly uncertain. To better understand this resource, we employ a least squares curve fitting method on 5773 wells in the Bakken, drilled from 2005 to mid-2013, fitting each well with hyperbolic decline (HD) and stretched exponential (SE) decline models. We characterize well productivity by vintage and location. Additionally, we construct scenarios to simulate future production by varying individual well productivity, well spacing, and drilling rate. Using the HD model, a typical Bakken well drilled to date is expected to produce 270 mbbl (mean) or 221 mbbl (median) over a 15-year life. Using the SE model these figures are slightly lower: 231 mbbl (mean), 181 mbbl (median). Over our study period, the cumulative production in the first six months of a well\u2019s life (IP180) increased and then remained steady. EURs increased until 2010 and have decreased since 2010. It appears that wells are becoming less productive over time, with the reasons not yet fully accounted for. Our base forecast has North Dakota producing at least 1\u00a0mmbbl/day for over 20\u00a0years, peaking at approximately 1.7\u00a0mmbbl/day in the mid-2020s. This period of high production can be shortened by faster-than-expected decline or extended by advances in technology. "

The NPV (net present value) of the retrofitted facility is maximized to determine which auxiliary system is preferable, under a variety of economic conditions. Optimized NPV is found to be most sensitive to the price of natural gas and the electricity price. At an 8% real discount rate, without renewable energy incentives, natural gas prices must be high (in excess of 10\u00a0USD/GJ) for a solar thermal design to be preferable, and electricity prices must reach \u224855 USD/MWh in order for solar-thermal-based designs to have a positive NPV.

The facility consists of a coal-fired power station undergoing retrofit with CO2 capture. The CO2 capture energy demand is provided by a specially designed combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT). The heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) component of the CCGT is modeled and optimized in detail, with explicit treatment of the discrete aspects of the HRSG configuration, including the number and sequential arrangement of HRSG internal components. Variable facility operations are represented by discrete operating modes selected based on the electricity price\u2013duration curve. Two objectives, the minimization of capital requirement and the maximization of net present value, are considered in a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation. Pareto frontiers, which define the optimal tradeoffs between these two objectives, are generated for six scenarios constructed from recent historical data from West Texas, the United Kingdom, and India. For a 440\u00a0MW coal plant in a scenario based on 2011 West Texas data, the minimum effective net present cost required for the retrofit (which meets the CO2 emission performance standard) varies from $278 to 383\u00a0million, and the minimum total capital investment requirement ranges from $346 to 517\u00a0million. The variations in these optimized values correspond to the range of the Pareto frontier within the bounds of the problem. The net present cost of the retrofit is less than the present value of the existing coal plant, $476\u00a0million, indicating that a retrofit is preferred over decommissioning. In the case of very low energy prices, however, decommissioning is shown to be the preferred option. The UK and India scenarios demonstrate that optimal designs can vary greatly depending upon location-specific economic conditions. "

The framework allows multiple energy pathways and flexible inclusion of non-energy sectors. This framework is then used to define a variety of ERRs that measure the amount of energy supplied by an energy extraction and processing pathway compared to the amount of energy consumed in producing the energy. ERRs that were previously defined in the literature are cast in our framework for calculation and comparison. For illustration, our framework is applied to include oil production and processing and generation of electricity from PV (photovoltaic) systems. Results show that ERR values will decline as system boundaries expand to include more processes. NERs (net energy return ratios) tend to be lower than GERs (gross energy return ratios).

Unfortunately, quantitative work to date in this area has suffered from poor data availability and uncertain methods. We apply a new methodology and new dataset to compute ERRs (energy return ratios) for the oil sands industry. We collected monthly oil sands energy consumption and output data from 1970 to 2010. Current oil sands operations have mine mouth NERs (net energy returns) of about 6\u00a0GJ output per GJ of energy consumed and point of use energy returns of about 3\u00a0GJ/GJ. Long-term trends show oil sands operations becoming significantly more efficient: point of use NER increased from about 1\u00a0GJ/GJ in 1970 to 3\u00a0GJ/GJ in 2010. These energy returns are lower than those observed in historical conventional oil operations, but low energy returns are not likely to hinder development of oil sands operations due to the large resource in place and the ability for largely self-fueled pathways to return significant amounts of energy to society for every unit of external energy supplied.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Future electricity generation systems may include the widespread use of renewables along with fossil fuels. In recent work we developed novel computational procedures for modeling and optimizing the operations of an integrated fossil-renewable power generation system with CO2 capture, subject to a daily average CO2 emission constraint. System components were modeled using energy and mass balances, and a formal optimization procedure was applied to determine the optimal hourly dispatch of system components to maximize operating profit in response to time-varying electricity prices and wind generation. In this study we extend this work by assessing other policy schemes and system designs. First, in lieu of an emission performance standard, CO2 taxes of $10/Mg CO2 to $70/Mg CO2 are applied. Second, we consider emission performance standards ranging from 0.326 Mg CO2/MWh to 1.001 Mg CO2/MWh for systems with oversized and heuristically-sized components. Optimized operating profit shows a nonlinear response to varying emission constraint levels. Taken together, our findings illustrate the effect of different policy schemes on optimized operating economics and CO2 emission levels, and quantify the potential benefits of flexibility in an integrated energy system.  Introduction CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has received wide attention in recent years as a possible means to mitigate the impact of fossil fuel use on climate. Widespread implementation of CCS would allow for the continued use of fossil fuels for electricity generation while reducing CO2 emissions. One problem CCS faces is that it entails large energy costs, with the cost for coal plants estimated at 24-40% of primary energy consumption (Metz et al. 2005), with a theoretical minimum of about 11% (House et al. 2009). It is nonetheless possible that CCS may be implemented at large scale in the coming decades.  Over a similar time frame, the electric power generation mix is expected to have an increasing fraction of energy provided by renewable energy resources, such as wind, that are characterized by high variability. The possible concurrence of CCS and the high penetration of renewables raises the question of how these two technologies will interact, and whether benefits can be realized by considering them within a unified framework.  In recent work we developed a modeling and optimization approach to begin to address this important question. Our methodology entails a modular representation of energy system components and enables the determination of system settings that maximize operating profit subject to a CO2 emission constraint. We treat an example system (based on a configuration actually proposed for a site in Wyoming to sell electricity to California (North American Power Group 2011)) that consists of a coal power station with CO2 capture powered by an auxiliary natural gas combustion turbine, and wind generation. Optimization of operating parameters was achieved for examples involving California energy prices and Wyoming wind generation data (Kang et al. 2011). The configuration used in that work differed from those most often studied in previous investigations, in that heat and energy demands for CO2 capture were provided by an auxiliary system, and not parasitically from the main coal plant. The system was constrained to meet a maximum daily average CO2 emission performance standard (EPS) of 0.499 Mg CO2/MWh, modeled after a California emissions regulation (California State Legislature 2006). Other researchers have also examined optimization of CCS power plants, though their work involved parasitic operation of the CO2 capture and was based on carbon prices rather than a specific EPS (Chalmers et al. 2009; Cohen et al. 2011). Formal optimization techniques have also been used by previous investigators for the design of CCS retrofits (Harkin et al. 2011), and for the design and operation of cogeneration power plants (J\u00fcdes et al. 2009).

The system treated consists of a coal-fired power station, a temperature-swing absorption CO2 capture facility powered by a natural gas combustion turbine, and wind generation. System components are represented in a modular fashion using energy and mass balances. Optimization is applied to determine hourly system dispatch to maximize operating profit given energy prices and wind generation data. A CO2 emission constraint, modeled after a California law, is enforced. Idealized and realistic scenarios are considered, along with several different system specifications. For a year of operation, simulated using available wind and energy price data, operating profit for optimized operation is shown to be approximately 20% greater than profit using a heuristic procedure. The benefit from optimization is positively correlated with electricity price variability and mean wind generation. The impact of different component specifications and different CO2 absorption solvents on the optimal operation of the energy system is also assessed. In total, this study demonstrates that the effective operating cost of an integrated energy system operating under a CO2 emission constraint can be substantially reduced via optimal flexible operation.

The full optimization problem is intractable, so a series of problem reductions are employed to explore the ISCC design space while ensuring that individual designs can operate feasibly for a wide range of operating conditions and under realistic constraints. We construct bi-objective Pareto fronts for two conflicting objectives: net present value (NPV) and average CO2 emissions intensity of power produced. A variety of ISCC designs are explored to find a superior configuration with physically feasible annual solar contribution (ASC) of up to 20%, a significant improvement over published designs. We then explore the sensitivity of the results to economic factors such as discount rate, power price, and capital cost. By examining the Pareto frontiers of each case, we quantify the economic cost of reduced CO2 emissions. The resulting ISCC-derived mitigation costs are found to be competitive with other CO2 mitigation technologies. "

The model representation considered here can be used to define the grid and transmissibilities, either at the original fine scale or at coarser scales, for any connectivity-list-based finite-volume flow simulator. For our fine-scale mesh, we use a polyhedral-gridding technique to construct a conforming matrix grid with adaptive refinement near fractures, which are represented as faces of grid cells. The algorithm uses a single input parameter to obtain a suitable compromise between fine-grid cell quality and the fidelity of the fracture representation. Discretization using a two-point flux approximation is accomplished with an existing procedure that treats fractures as lower-dimensional entities (i.e., resolution in the transverse direction is not required). The upscaling method is an aggregation-based technique in which coarse control volumes are aggregates of fine-scale cells, and coarse transmissibilities are computed with a general flow-based procedure. Numerical results are presented for waterflood, sour-gas injection, and gas-condensate primary production for fracture models with matrix and fracture heterogeneities. Coarse-model accuracy is shown to generally decrease with increasing levels of coarsening, as would be expected. We demonstrate, however, that with our methodology, two orders of magnitude of speedup can typically be achieved with models that introduce less than approximately 10% error (with error appropriately defined). This suggests that the overall framework may be very useful for the simulation of realistic discrete-fracture-matrix models. "

The procedure enables the maximization of net present value (NPV) subject to satisfaction of a specified modified internal rate of return (MIRR). Knowledge of the economic project life enables the operator to plan for infill drilling or some other type of field development in the case that the lease/contract duration is longer than the optimal project life. This will enable NPV to be maximized, and the hurdle rate to be honored, over the entire duration of the lease. The optimization is formulated as a nested procedure in which economic project life is optimized in the outer loop, and the associated well settings [time-varying bottomhole pressures (BHPs) in the cases considered] are optimized in the inner loop. The inner-loop optimization is accomplished by use of an adjoint-gradient-based approach, while the outer-loop optimization entails an interpolation technique. The successful application of this framework for production optimization for 2D and 3D reservoir models under waterflood is demonstrated. The tradeoff between maximized NPV and rate of return is assessed, as is the impact of discount rate on optimal operations. In the second example, we illustrate the advantages of initiating a new project (that satisfies the hurdle rate) once the EPL is reached. Taken in total, the results in this paper demonstrate the importance of explicitly incorporating both NPV and rate of return in production-optimization formulations. "

The method combines trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL), where solutions with new sets of well controls are constructed based on linearization around previously simulated (training) solutions, and projection into a low-dimensional subspace using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The resulting representation is low-dimensional and linear, in contrast to the original nonlinear full-order flow simulations. Several new POD-TPWL treatments are introduced and demonstrated. These include the use of multiple derivatives, meaning that the linearizations are performed around different training solutions at different time steps, and the use of rate-controlled (rather than pressure-controlled) injection wells. Two example cases are presented, and the ability of the POD-TPWL model to accurately capture wellbore pressure, when time-varying CO2 injection rates are prescribed, is demonstrated. It is also shown that, for these examples, the reduced-order models can provide accurate estimates of CO2 molar fraction at particular locations in the domain. The POD-TPWL model is then incorporated into a mesh adaptive direct search optimization framework where the objective is to minimize the amount of CO2 reaching a target layer at the end of the injection period. The POD-TPWL model is shown to be well suited for this purpose and to provide optimization results that are comparable to those obtained using full-order simulations. The preprocessing computations needed to construct the POD-TPWL models entail a (serial) time equivalent of about 6.7 full-order simulations, though the resulting runtime speedups, relative to full-order simulation, are about 100\u2013150 for the cases considered.

In this work, a computationally efficient ISCC model is constructed that includes detailed modeling of the heat recovery steam generator that links the natural gas and solar\u00a0thermal systems. The model is validated against a model in the literature, and then used to perform computational optimization of the facility operations. Critically, a wide variety of practical system constraints are considered at each time step evaluated in order to ensure system feasibility under realistic conditions. It is shown that under different operating modes the ISCC design examined displays similar emission rates, yet significantly different profit ranges. A marked increase in the operating flexibility of the ISCC is observed when the outlet temperature of the solar heat transfer fluid is allowed to vary over the course of the day. "

The method extends existing techniques based on trajectory piecewise linear (TPWL) approximations by incorporating second-derivative terms into the reduced-order treatment. Both the linear and quadratic reduced-order methods, referred to as POD-TPWL and POD-TPWQ, entail the representation of new solutions as expansions around previously simulated high-fidelity (full-order) training solutions, along with POD-based projection into a low-dimensional space. POD-TPWQ entails significantly more offline preprocessing than POD-TPWL as it requires generating and projecting several third-order (Hessian-type) terms. The POD-TPWQ method is implemented for two-dimensional systems. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that it provides consistently better accuracy than POD-TPWL, with speedups of about two orders of magnitude relative to high-fidelity simulations for the problems considered. We demonstrate that POD-TPWQ can be used as an error estimator for POD-TPWL, which motivates the development of a trust-region-based optimization framework. This procedure uses POD-TPWL for fast function evaluations and a POD-TPWQ error estimator to determine when retraining, which entails a high-fidelity simulation, is required. Optimization results for an oil\u2013water problem demonstrate the substantial speedups that can be achieved relative to optimizations based on high-fidelity simulation. "

Because flow simulation over many permeability realizations (only permeability is considered to be uncertain in this study) may entail excessive computation, simulations are often performed for only a subset of \u2018representative' realizations. It is however challenging to identify a representative subset that provides flow statistics in close agreement with those from the full set, especially when the decision parameters (e.g., time-varying well pressures, well locations) are unknown a priori, as they are in optimization problems. In this work, we introduce a general framework, based on clustering, for selecting a representative subset of realizations for use in simulations involving \u2018new\u2019 sets of decision parameters. Prior to clustering, each realization is represented by a low-dimensional feature vector that contains a combination of permeability-based and flow-based quantities. Calculation of flow-based features requires the specification of a (base) flow problem and simulation over the full set of realizations. Permeability information is captured concisely through use of principal component analysis. By computing the difference between the flow response for the subset and the full set, we quantify the performance of various realization-selection methods. The impact of different weightings for flow and permeability information in the cluster-based selection procedure is assessed for a range of examples involving different types of decision parameters. These decision parameters are generated either randomly, in a manner that is consistent with the solutions proposed in global stochastic optimization procedures such as GA and PSO, or through perturbation around a base case, consistent with the solutions considered in pattern search optimization. We find that flow-based clustering is preferable for problems involving new well settings (e.g., time-varying well bottom-hole pressures) or small changes in well configuration, while both permeability-based and flow-based clustering provide similar results for (new) random multiwell configurations. We also investigate the use of efficient tracer-type simulations for obtaining flow-based features and demonstrate that this treatment performs nearly as well as full-physics simulations for the cases considered. The various procedures are applied to select realizations for use in production optimization under uncertainty, which greatly accelerates the optimization computations. Optimization performance is shown to be consistent with the realization-selection results for cases involving new decision parameters. "

The key steps of the methodology are mesh generation, fine-grid discretization, upscaling, and coarse-grid discretization. Our specialized gridding technique combines a set of intersecting triangulated surfaces by constructing approximate intersections using existing edges. This procedure creates a conforming mesh of all surfaces, which defines the internal boundaries for the volumetric mesh. The flow equations are discretized on this conforming fine mesh using an optimized two-point flux finite-volume approximation. The resulting discrete model is represented by a list of control-volumes with associated positions and pore-volumes, and a list of cell-to-cell connections with associated transmissibilities. Coarse models are then constructed by the aggregation of fine-grid cells, and the transmissibilities between adjacent coarse cells are obtained using flow-based upscaling procedures. Through appropriate computation of fracture-matrix transmissibilities, a dual-continuum representation is obtained on the coarse scale in regions with connected fracture networks. The fine and coarse discrete models generated within the framework are compatible with any connectivity-based simulator. The applicability of the methodology is illustrated for several two- and three-dimensional examples. In particular, we consider gas production from naturally fractured low-permeability formations, and transport through complex fracture networks. In all cases, highly accurate solutions are obtained with significant model reduction. "

Such parameterizations are particularly useful when the subspace representation is constructed to implicitly capture the key geological features that appear in prior geostatistical realizations. In this case, the parameterization can be used very effectively within a data assimilation framework. In this paper, we extend and apply geological parameterization techniques based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for the representation of complex geomodels characterized by non-Gaussian spatial statistics. KPCA involves the application of PCA in a high-dimensional feature space and the subsequent reverse mapping of the feature-space model back to physical space. This reverse mapping, referred to as the pre-image problem, can be challenging because it (formally) involves a nonlinear minimization. In this work, a new explicit pre-image procedure, which avoids many of the problems with existing approaches, is introduced. To achieve (ensemble-level) flow responses in close agreement with those from reference geostatistical realizations, a bound-constrained, regularized version of KPCA, referred to as R-KPCA, is also introduced. R-KPCA can be viewed as a post-processing of realizations generated using KPCA. The R-KPCA representation is incorporated into an adjoint-gradient-based data assimilation procedure, and its use for history matching a complex deltaic fan system is demonstrated. Matlab code for the KPCA and R-KPCA procedures is provided online as Supplementary Material. "

The mixed-salt treatment involves the use of ammonia for CO2 absorption and potassium carbonate primarily to control ammonia slip. The processes are represented in terms of energy duty requirements within a modular heat integration code developed for CO2 capture modeling and optimization. The model includes a baseload coal plant, a gas-fired subsystem containing gas turbines and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), and a CO2 capture facility. A formal bi-objective optimization procedure is applied to determine the design (e.g., detailed HRSG components and pressure levels, gas turbine capacity, CO2 capture capacity) and time-varying operations of the facility to simultaneously maximize net present value (NPV) and minimize total capital requirement (TCR), while meeting a maximum CO2 emission intensity constraint. For a realistic scenario constructed using historical data, optimization results indicate that both advanced processes outperform MEA in both objectives, and the mixed-salt process in turn outperforms the piperazine process. Specifically, for the scenario considered, the base case mixed-salt process achieves 16% greater NPV and 14% lower TCR than the MEA process, and 10% greater NPV and 5% lower TCR than the piperazine process. A five-case sensitivity study of the mixed-salt process indicates that it is competitive with the piperazine process and consistently outperforms the MEA process. "

The history-matching procedure uses particle swarm optimization to minimize the error between leakage-model solutions and synthetic observation data by adjusting model parameters governing the size and location of the leak, as well as the heterogeneous permeability field throughout the model. The method applies to storage projects with uncertain heterogeneous geology that may be described by a variogram model. Results from several examples indicate that as little as 6\u201312 months of above-zone pressure monitoring data, collected from at least 3 or 4 wells, may be sufficient to locate and estimate the size of a leak to inform mitigation and remediation strategies. No significant benefit is seen when using multilevel monitoring wells versus single-level monitoring wells. We also find that adding white noise to the synthetic observation data, with magnitude consistent with current pressure monitoring techniques, generally reduces error in solutions, likely due to a regularization effect.

It is therefore difficult to apply computational procedures that require large numbers of flow simulations, such as optimization, for EOR processes. In this paper, we develop an accurate and robust upscaling procedure for oil/gas compositional flow simulation. The method requires a global fine-scale compositional simulation, from which we compute the required upscaled parameters and functions associated with each coarse-scale interface or wellblock. These include coarse-scale transmissibilities, upscaled relative permeability functions, and so-called \u03b1-factors, which act to capture component flow rates in the oil and gas phases. Specialized near-well treatments for both injection and production wells are introduced. An iterative procedure for optimizing the \u03b1-factors is incorporated to further improve coarse-model accuracy. The upscaling methodology is applied to two example cases, a 2D model with eight components and a 3D model with four components, with flow in both cases driven by wells arranged in a five-spot pattern. Numerical results demonstrate that the global compositional upscaling procedure consistently provides very accurate coarse results for both phase and component production rates, at both the field and well level. The robustness of the compositionally upscaled models is assessed by simulating cases with time-varying well bottomhole pressures that are significantly different from those used when the coarse model was constructed. The coarse models are shown to provide accurate predictions in these tests, indicating that the upscaled model is robust with respect to well settings. This suggests that one can use upscaled models generated from our procedure to mitigate computational demands in important applications such as well-control optimization. "

                    "abstract": "We optimize the design and time-varying operation of a CO2-capture-enabled power station burning coal and natural gas, subject to a CO2 emission intensity constraint. The facility consists of a coal-fired power plant and an amine CO2 capture system, which is powered by a combined-heat-and-power auxiliary gas-fired subsystem. The detailed design of the CO2 capture system, the detailed heat integration of the facility, and time-varying operations schedule across all hours of the year are determined in a single optimization problem. This problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed integer nonlinear program: objectives include minimizing total capital requirement (TCR) and maximizing net present value (NPV). Because the Aspen Plus model used for the CO2 capture system is too computationally intensive to use directly in optimization runs, we develop a statistical proxy model of the capture system that reproduces Aspen Plus results but is several hundred times faster. The integrated proxy model includes statistical submodels for the CO2 absorption and solvent regeneration blocks, as well as simple physical models of other system components. Incorporating the detailed CO2 capture system in the optimization provides important design information such as the optimal number of CO2 capture trains required. Two scenarios are considered, based on historical data for Texas and India. Results show that the choice of objective function can have a strong effect on planned operating profile (constant or variable operations). Similarly, hourly electricity price variability strongly affects design and plant scheduling. In the West Texas scenario, which has high price variability, the maximum NPV objective favors variable operations, with a CO2 capture system utilization factor of 65.9% (out of a maximum of 85%), while the minimum TCR objective favors constant operations. In contrast, because of low electricity price variability in the India scenario, there is little value in time-shifting the demand for capture heat, so constant operations are favored in this case for both objectives.

The application of upscaling techniques could lead to substantial reductions in computational cost. This work targets the development of an upscaling procedure that is applicable for the CO2 injection stage, which corresponds to a drainage process. Specifically, we develop and apply a new upscaling technique for two-phase flow in heterogeneous formations with capillary heterogeneity effects. The procedure entails first upscaling capillary pressure in the capillary limit, and then computing coarse-scale relative permeability functions using a global dynamic upscaling procedure. An iterative method is applied to enhance the accuracy of the upscaled capillary pressure functions. The new dynamic upscaling approach is applied to a synthetic heterogeneous two-dimensional aquifer model that involves injection of CO2 into brine. Fine-scale simulation results are compared with coarse-scale results generated using both the dynamic upscaling approach and a simpler method that entails the use of upscaled capillary pressure in conjunction with rock relative permeability curves. It is shown that the dynamic upscaling procedure provides results that are close to those from the fine-scale simulation and are consistently more accurate than results from the simpler method. The upscaling procedure is tested over a range of injection rates spanning three orders of magnitude. We show that, although the upscaled functions are in general rate dependent, accurate coarse-scale results can be obtained using upscaled relative permeability functions computed at only two different flow rates. We also observe that the model constructed using our method retains reasonable accuracy even when the flow problem differs from that used to compute the upscaled functions. "

CLFD involves three major steps: optimizing the field-development plan on the basis of current geological knowledge; drilling new wells, and collecting hard data and production data; and updating multiple geological models on the basis of all the available data. In the optimization step, the number, type, locations, and controls for new wells (and future controls for existing wells) are optimized with a hybrid particle swarm optimization-mesh adaptive direct search algorithm. The objective here is to maximize expected (over multiple realizations) net present value (NPV) of the overall project. History matching is accomplished with an adjoint-gradient-based \"randomized maximum likelihood\" procedure. Because the CLFD history-matching component is fast relative to the optimization component, we generate a relatively large number of history-matched models. Optimization is then performed with a set of \"representative\" realizations selected from the full set of history-matched models. We introduce a systematic optimization with sample validation (OSV) procedure, in which the number of realizations used for optimization is increased if an appropriate validation criterion is not satisfied. The CLFD methodology is applied to 2D and 3D example cases. Results show that the use of CLFD increases the NPV for the \"true\" (synthetic) model by 10 to 70% relative to that achieved by optimizing over a large number of prior realizations. We also compare the results for CLFD with OSV to results that use a fixed number of geological realizations. These comparisons show that the use of too few realizations in the CLFD optimization step can result in lower true-model NPVs, whereas OSV provides a systematic approach for determining the proper number of realizations.

For a 440\u00a0MW coal plant in a scenario based on 2011 West Texas data, the minimum effective net present cost required for the retrofit (which meets the CO2 emission performance standard) varies from $278 to 383\u00a0million, and the minimum total capital investment requirement ranges from $346 to 517\u00a0million. The variations in these optimized values correspond to the range of the Pareto frontier within the bounds of the problem. The net present cost of the retrofit is less than the present value of the existing coal plant, $476\u00a0million, indicating that a retrofit is preferred over decommissioning.

Several new POD-TPWL treatments, including the use of a Petrov-Galerkin projection to reduce the number of equations (rather than the Galerkin projection, which was applied previously), and a new procedure for determining which saved state to use for linearization are incorporated into the method. Results are presented for heterogeneous 3D reservoir models containing oil and gas phases with up to six hydrocarbon components. Reasonably close agreement between full-order reference solutions and compositional POD-TPWL simulations is demonstrated for the cases considered. Construction of the POD-TPWL model requires preprocessing overhead computations equivalent to approximately three or four full-order runs. Runtime speedups by use of POD-TPWL are, however, very significant\u2014up to a factor of 800 for the cases considered. The POD-TPWL model is thus well suited for use in computational optimization, in which many simulations must be performed, and we present an example demonstrating its application for such a problem.

For example, in a waterflooding project, we might seek to maximize oil recovery and minimize water injection. It is therefore important to devise and test optimization procedures that consider two or more objectives in the determination of optimal development and production plans. In this work we present an approach for field development optimization with two objectives. A single-objective product formulation, which systematically combines the two objectives in a sequence of single-objective optimization problems, is applied. The method, called BiPSOMADS, utilizes at its core our recently developed PSO\u2013MADS (Particle Swarm Optimization\u2013Mesh Adaptive Direct Search) hybrid optimization algorithm. This derivative-free procedure has been shown to be effective for the solution of generalized field development and well control problems that include categorical, discrete and continuous variables along with general (nonlinear) constraints. Four biobjective field development and well control examples are solved using BiPSOMADS. These examples include problems that consider the maximization of both net present value and cumulative oil production, and the maximization of both long-term and short-term reservoir performance. An example that highlights the applicability of biobjective optimization for field development under geological uncertainty is also presented. This usage of BiPSOMADS enables us to maximize expected reservoir performance while reducing the risk associated with the worst-case scenario. "

In this paper, we introduce and apply such a methodology for data assimilation problems. The technique applied to provide flow simulation results, trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL), has been used previously for production optimization problems, where it has provided large computational speedups. The TPWL model developed here represents simulation results for new geological realizations in terms of a linearization around previously simulated (training) cases. The high-dimensional representation of the states is projected into a low-dimensional subspace using proper orthogonal decomposition. The geological models are also represented in reduced terms using a Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve expansion of the log-transmissibility field. Thus, both the reservoir states and geological parameters are described very concisely. The reduced-order representation of flow and geology is appropriate for use with ensemble-based data assimilation procedures, and here it is incorporated into an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) framework to enrich the ensemble at a low cost. The method is able to reconstruct full-order states, which are required by EnKF, whenever necessary. The combined technique enables EnKF to be applied using many fewer high-fidelity reservoir simulations than would otherwise be required to avoid ensemble collapse. For two- and three-dimensional example cases, it is demonstrated that EnKF results using 50 high-fidelity simulations along with 150 TPWL simulations are much better than those using only 50 high-fidelity simulations (for which ensemble collapse is observed) and are, in fact, comparable to the results achieved using 200 high-fidelity simulations.

As a rst step, the method entails the construction of the Jacobian matrix for a compositional system that does not include any chemical reactions.

These transformations act to convert the initial component-based Jacobian matrix to a matrix based on element balances. In so doing, they eliminate all equilibrium reaction rates and reduce the number of kinetic reaction terms that appear. A specialized treatment for handling aqueous-phase components when the aqueous phase disappears (or reappears) is also introduced. Numerical results are presented for CO2 sequestration and in-situ conversion problems.

The technique is based on an expanded well model concept which provides a systematic procedure for the construction of the near-well grid. The method proceeds by first defining an underlying fine-scale model, in which the well and any key near-well features such as hydraulic fractures are fully resolved using an unstructured grid. In the (coarse) simulation model, the geometry of the grid in the expanded well region, and the associated \"radial\" transmissibilities, are determined from the solution of a fine-scale, single-phase, well-driven flow problem. The coarse-scale transmissibilities outside of the well region are computed using existing local upscaling techniques or by applying a new global upscaling procedure. Thus, through use of near-well flow-based gridding and generalized local grid refinement, this methodology efficiently incorporates the advantages of highly-resolved unstructured grid representations of wells into coarse models. The overall model provided by this technique is compatible with any reservoir simulator that allows general unstructured cell-to-cell connections (model capabilities, in terms of flow physics, are defined by the simulator). The expanded well-modeling approach is applied to challenging 3D problems involving injection and production in a low-permeability heterogeneous reservoir, tight-gas production by a hydraulically-fractured well, and production in a gas-condensate reservoir. In the first two cases, where it is possible to simulate the fine-grid unstructured model, results using the expanded well model closely match the reference solutions, while standard approaches lead to significant error. In the gas-condensate example, which involves a nine-component compositional model, the reference solution is not computed, but the solution using the expanded well model is shown to be physically reasonable while standard coarse-grid solutions show large variation under grid refinement.

Computational optimization can be used to provide modes of operation that maximize preferable trapping mechanisms. In this work we apply optimization procedures to minimize the mobile fraction of CO2 at the end of a 1000-year injection and storage operation in a brine aquifer. A noninvasive gradient-free direct search technique is used for the optimizations. Examples involving only CO2 injection, as well as cases that also include brine cycling, are considered. Brine cycling entails the periodic production of brine from the bottom of the aquifer along with the coincident re-injection of brine into the top of the aquifer. Optimization variables include well locations and injection rates for CO2 injection wells, and the timing and injection volumes for brine cycling. Results demonstrate that optimization can significantly reduce the mobile CO2 fraction compared with base case scenarios. We also show that mobile CO2 fraction decreases monotonically with increasing volumes of brine cycling. The resulting plot of minimum mobile CO2 fraction versus pore volume of brine injected provides the Pareto front for a bi-objective optimization involving these two variables as objectives. The impact of grid resolution on the optimization results is also considered. "

The approach is an element-based formulation that combines the compositional modeling capabilities used in oil reservoir simulation with the treatment of chemical reactions used in groundwater modeling. The procedure employs a conservative finite-volume method with a fully-implicit treatment in time in order to preserve the nonlinear coupling of flow, transport, reactions, and mass transfer across phases. Phase behavior is described using cubic equations of state. In this framework, all the governing equations and associated constraints are cast in discrete residual form, such that any variable, or coefficient, can depend on any other variable in the problem. Prior to linearization, which is applied to construct the Jacobian matrix, no algebraic or analytic manipulation need be performed to reduce the nonlinear sets of equations and unknowns. Once the complete Jacobian matrix is assembled, a series of algebraic reductions (Schur complements), of the type used in compositional reservoir simulation, are performed to reduce the number of discrete equations that must be solved simultaneously. A GMRES solution strategy with CPR (Constrained Pressure Residual) preconditioning is applied to solve the reduced linear system. We demonstrate the formulation using two CO2 sequestration problems, one of which involves chemical reactions.

                    "abstract": "Subsurface geology is highly uncertain, and it is necessary to account for this uncertainty when optimizing the location of new wells. This can be accomplished by evaluating reservoir performance for a particular well configuration over multiple realizations of the reservoir and then optimizing based, for example, on expected net present value (NPV) or expected cumulative oil production. A direct procedure for such an optimization would entail the simulation of all realizations at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. This could be prohibitively expensive when it is necessary to use a large number of realizations to capture geological uncertainty. In this work, we apply a procedure that is new within the context of reservoir management--retrospective optimization (RO)--to address this problem. RO solves a sequence of optimization subproblems that contain increasing numbers of realizations. We introduce the use of k -means clustering for selecting these realizations. Three example cases are presented that demonstrate the performance of the RO procedure. These examples use particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simplex linear interpolation (SLI)-based line search as the core optimizers (the RO framework can be used with any underlying optimization algorithm, either stochastic or deterministic). In the first example, we achieve essentially the same optimum using RO as we do using a direct optimization approach, but RO requires an order of magnitude fewer simulations. The results demonstrate the advantages of cluster-based sampling over random sampling for the examples considered. Taken in total, our findings indicate that RO using cluster sampling represents a promising approach for optimizing well locations under geological uncertainty. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Future electricity generation systems may include the widespread use of renewables along with fossil fuels. In recent work we developed novel computational procedures for modeling and optimizing the operations of an integrated fossil-renewable power generation system with CO2 capture, subject to a daily average CO2 emission constraint. System components were modeled using energy and mass balances, and a formal optimization procedure was applied to determine the optimal hourly dispatch of system components to maximize operating profit in response to time-varying electricity prices and wind generation. In this study we extend this work by assessing other policy schemes and system designs. First, in lieu of an emission performance standard, CO2 taxes of $10/Mg CO2 to $70/Mg CO2 are applied. Second, we consider emission performance standards ranging from 0.326 Mg CO2/MWh to 1.001 Mg CO2/MWh for systems with oversized and heuristically-sized components. Optimized operating profit shows a nonlinear response to varying emission constraint levels. Taken together, our findings illustrate the effect of different policy schemes on optimized operating economics and CO2 emission levels, and quantify the potential benefits of flexibility in an integrated energy system.  Introduction CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has received wide attention in recent years as a possible means to mitigate the impact of fossil fuel use on climate. Widespread implementation of CCS would allow for the continued use of fossil fuels for electricity generation while reducing CO2 emissions. One problem CCS faces is that it entails large energy costs, with the cost for coal plants estimated at 24-40% of primary energy consumption (Metz et al. 2005), with a theoretical minimum of about 11% (House et al. 2009). It is nonetheless possible that CCS may be implemented at large scale in the coming decades.  Over a similar time frame, the electric power generation mix is expected to have an increasing fraction of energy provided by renewable energy resources, such as wind, that are characterized by high variability. The possible concurrence of CCS and the high penetration of renewables raises the question of how these two technologies will interact, and whether benefits can be realized by considering them within a unified framework.  In recent work we developed a modeling and optimization approach to begin to address this important question. Our methodology entails a modular representation of energy system components and enables the determination of system settings that maximize operating profit subject to a CO2 emission constraint. We treat an example system (based on a configuration actually proposed for a site in Wyoming to sell electricity to California (North American Power Group 2011)) that consists of a coal power station with CO2 capture powered by an auxiliary natural gas combustion turbine, and wind generation. Optimization of operating parameters was achieved for examples involving California energy prices and Wyoming wind generation data (Kang et al. 2011). The configuration used in that work differed from those most often studied in previous investigations, in that heat and energy demands for CO2 capture were provided by an auxiliary system, and not parasitically from the main coal plant. The system was constrained to meet a maximum daily average CO2 emission performance standard (EPS) of 0.499 Mg CO2/MWh, modeled after a California emissions regulation (California State Legislature 2006). Other researchers have also examined optimization of CCS power plants, though their work involved parasitic operation of the CO2 capture and was based on carbon prices rather than a specific EPS (Chalmers et al. 2009; Cohen et al. 2011). Formal optimization techniques have also been used by previous investigators for the design of CCS retrofits (Harkin et al. 2011), and for the design and operation of cogeneration power plants (J\u00fcdes et al. 2009).

Much of the early production was from dry gas fields such as the Barnett Shale in North Texas (Montgomery et al., 2005), but recent industry attention has shifted to gas condensate and light-oil bearing shale formations such as the Eagle Ford of South Texas and the Bakken in North Dakota (Pollastro et al., 2008). Horizontal drilling combined with multi-stage hydraulic fracturing techniques has been crucial to unlocking both gas and oil from shale reservoirs. These resource plays are characterized by large drilling programs involving hundreds of wells drilled per year. "

The system treated consists of a coal-fired power station, a temperature-swing absorption CO2 capture facility powered by a natural gas combustion turbine, and wind generation. System components are represented in a modular fashion using energy and mass balances. Optimization is applied to determine hourly system dispatch to maximize operating profit given energy prices and wind generation data. A CO2 emission constraint, modeled after a California law, is enforced. Idealized and realistic scenarios are considered, along with several different system specifications. For a year of operation, simulated using available wind and energy price data, operating profit for optimized operation is shown to be approximately 20% greater than profit using a heuristic procedure. The benefit from optimization is positively correlated with electricity price variability and mean wind generation. The impact of different component specifications and different CO2 absorption solvents on the optimal operation of the energy system is also assessed. In total, this study demonstrates that the effective operating cost of an integrated energy system operating under a CO2 emission constraint can be substantially reduced via optimal flexible operation.

Using TPWL, new solutions are represented in terms of expansions around previously simulated (and saved) solutions. High degrees of efficiency are achieved when the representation is projected into a low-dimensional space using a basis constructed by proper orthogonal decomposition of snapshots generated in a training run. In recent work, a TPWL procedure applicable for two-phase subsurface flow problems was presented. The method was shown to perform well for many cases, such as those with no density differences between phases, though accuracy and robustness were found to degrade in other cases. In this work, these limitations are shown to be related to model accuracy at key locations and model stability. Enhancements addressing both of these issues are introduced. A new TPWL procedure, referred to as local resolution TPWL, enables key grid blocks (such as those containing injection or production wells) to be represented at full resolution; i.e., these blocks are not projected into the low-dimensional space. This leads to high accuracy at selected locations, and will be shown to improve the accuracy of important simulation quantities such as injection and production rates. Next, two techniques for enhancing the stability of the TPWL model are presented. The first approach involves a basis optimization procedure in which the number of columns in the basis matrix is determined to minimize the spectral radius of an appropriately defined amplification matrix. The second procedure incorporates a basis matrix constructed using snapshots from a simulation with equal phase densities. Both approaches are compatible with the local resolution procedure. Results for a series of test cases demonstrate the accuracy and stability provided by the new treatments. Finally, the TPWL model is used as a surrogate in a direct search optimization algorithm, and comparison with results using the full-order model demonstrates the efficacy of the enhanced TPWL procedures for this application.

                    "abstract": "The optimization of large-scale multiwell field-development projects is challenging because the number of optimization variables and the size of the search space can become excessive. This difficulty can be circumvented by considering well patterns and then optimizing parameters associated with the pattern type and geometry. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for accomplishing this type of optimization. The overall procedure, which we refer to as well-pattern optimization (WPO), includes a new well-pattern description (WPD) incorporated into an underlying optimization method. The WPD encodes potential solutions in terms of pattern types (e.g., five-spot, nine-spot) and pattern operators. The operators define geometric transformations (e.g., stretching, rotating) quantified by appropriate sets of parameters. It is the parameters that specify the well patterns and the pattern operators, along with additional variables that define the sequence of operations, that are optimized. A technique for subsequent well-by-well perturbation (WWP), in which the locations of wells within each pattern are optimized, is also presented. This WWP represents an optional second phase of WPO. The overall optimization procedure could be used with a variety of underlying optimization methods. Here, we combine it with a particle-swarm-optimization (PSO) technique because PSO methods have been shown recently to provide robust and efficient optimizations for well-placement problems. Detailed optimization results are presented for several example cases. In one case, multiple reservoir models are considered to account for geological uncertainty. For all examples, significant improvement in the objective function is observed as the algorithm proceeds, particularly at early iterations. The use of well-by-well perturbation (following determination of the optimal pattern) is shown to provide additional improvement. Limited comparisons with results using standard well patterns of various sizes demonstrate that the net present values (NPVs) achieved by the new algorithm are considerably larger. Taken in total, the optimization results highlight the potential of the overall procedure for use in practical field development. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We present a new framework for modeling wells in reservoir simulators. The approach is based on an expanded well model in which the well region is expanded geometrically to include portions of the reservoir. The method proceeds by first defining an underlying fine-scale model, in which the well and any key near-well features such as hydraulic fractures are fully resolved using an unstructured grid. The geometry, grid structure and transmissibilities in the coarse-model well region, and the linkage between the well and reservoir regions, are determined from the solution of a single-phase steady-state pressure equation on the underlying fine grid. The method is compatible with any reservoir simulator that allows general (unstructured) cell-to-cell connections. The expanded well modeling procedure is applied to challenging three-dimensional problems involving production in a low-permeability reservoir, tight-gas production via a hydraulically-fractured well, and production in a gas-condensate reservoir. In the first two cases, where it is possible to simulate the fine-grid unstructured model, results using the expanded well model closely match the reference solutions, while standard approaches lead to significant error. In the gas-condensate example, which involves a nine-component compositional model, the reference solution is not computed, but the solution using the expanded well model is shown to be physically reasonable while standard coarse-grid solutions show large variation under grid refinement.  Introduction Computing well performance accurately is very important for reservoir management and optimization. Standard large-scale reservoir simulators, however, are not able to resolve detailed near-well physics such as the interaction between the local pressure gradient, reservoir heterogeneity, and well completion components. This is because these effects occur on scales that are very small compared to typical simulation grid blocks. Traditional techniques use an idealized representation of the well, the completion, and the near-well region. In addition, they rely on an analytical pressure solution to describe the interaction between the well and the reservoir. Peaceman (1978) proposed a simple well model to couple the wellbore pressure to the well-block pressure using a single parameter { the well index.\u00a0  This model was proposed for a fully penetrating well located at the center of a square block with homogeneous permeability. Later this technique was extended to nonsquare grid blocks with anisotropic permeability and off-center wells (Peaceman, 1983, 1990). Similar techniques have been used to model slanted and horizontal wells (Joshi, 1987, 1988). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In production optimization, we seek to determine the well settings (bottomhole pressures, flow rates) that maximize an objective function such as net present value. In this paper we introduce and apply a new approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm for this optimization problem. ADP aims to approximate the global optimum using limited computational resources via a systematic set of procedures that approximate exact dynamic programming algorithms. The method is able to satisfy general constraints such as maximum watercut and maximum liquid production rate in addition to bound constraints. ADP has been used in many application areas, but it does not appear to have been implemented previously for production optimization. The ADP algorithm is applied to twodimensional problems involving primary production and water injection. We demonstrate that the algorithm is able to provide clear improvement in the objective function compared to baseline strategies. It is also observed that, in cases where the global optimum is known (or surmised), ADP provides a result within 1-2% of the global optimum. Thus the ADP procedure may be appropriate for practical production optimization problems.  Introduction Many optimization algorithms have been applied to maximize reservoir performance. Most of these optimization algorithms can be classified into two categories: gradient-based/direct-search [20, 15] and global stochastic search [13, 1, 7]. Both classes of optimization algorithms face limitations: gradient-based and direct-search algorithms settle for local optima, while global stochastic search algorithms such as genetic algorithms typically require many function evaluations for convergence, and even then there is no assurance that the global optimum has been found.  In principle, one can formulate production optimization as a nonlinear optimal control problem and find a global optimum using dynamic programming (DP) [2]. The key idea in DP is to decompose the optimization problem into a sequence of sub-problems, each representing optimization of a control action at one point in time. These sub-problems are related through the value function, which maps the system state to the net present value of future revenues. Once the value function is computed, the optimal control action at each time can be found by solving a sub-problem at that time. In general, these sub-problems are much simpler than the original optimization problem; in many cases, a global optimum of each sub-problem can be efficiently computed.  For problems of practical scale, the computational requirements of DP become prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. In particular, time and memory requirements typically grow exponentially with the number of state variables. Approximate dynamic programming (ADP) aims to address this computational burden by efficiently approximating the value function (see [3, 25, 19] for more on ADP). The result is an approximate value function, which is typically represented by a linear combination of a set of predefined basis functions. ADP algorithms provide methods for computing the coefficients associated with these basis functions. ADP has been successfully applied across a broad range of domains such as asset pricing [23, 18, 24], transportation logistics [21], revenue management [26, 10, 27], portfolio management [14, 12], and even to games such as backgammon [22].

                    "abstract": "Abstract Reduced-order modeling represents an attractive framework for accelerating computationally expensive reservoir simulation applications. In this paper we introduce and apply a reduced-order modeling approach for history matching. The method considered, trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL), has been used previously for production optimization problems, where it has provided large computational speedups. The TPWL model developed here represents simulation results for new geological models in terms of a linearization around previously simulated (training) cases. The high-dimensional state space is projected into a low-dimensional subspace using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The geological model is represented in terms of a Karhunen-Loeve expansion of the log-transmissibility field, so both the reservoir states and geological parameters are described in a very concise way. The method is incorporated into an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) history-matching procedure. The combined technique enables EnKF to be applied using many fewer (high-fidelity) reservoir simulations than would otherwise be required to avoid ensemble collapse. More specifically, it is demonstrated that EnKF results using 50 high-fidelity simulations along with 150 TPWL simulations are much better than those using only 50 high-fidelity simulations and are, in fact, comparable to the results achieved using 200 high- fidelity simulations.  Introduction History matching is an essential component of reservoir modeling and management. It entails the updating of the reservoir model using dynamic data, e.g., production data or time-lapse seismic data. History matching can be viewed as an optimization problem in which the mismatch between observed and simulated data is minimized by modifying the parameters associated with the geological model. It typically requires large numbers of simulations, which can be extremely time consuming if high-resolution models are used. Thus, there is a significant need for efficient (proxy or surrogate) models that can predict simulation results with reasonable accuracy.  Reduced-order modeling procedures, which have been applied in many application areas including reservoir simulation, represent a means for accelerating flow simulations. Many of these techniques entail the projection of the full-order (high-fidelity) numerical description into a low-dimensional subspace, which reduces the number of unknowns that must be computed at each time step. Existing approaches, applied within the context of reservoir simulation, include procedures based on proper orthogonal decomposition (Cardoso et al., 2009; Markovinovic and Jansen, 2006; van Doren et al., 2006) and techniques based on trajectory piecewise linearization, TPWL (Cardoso and Durlofsky, 2010a,b; He, 2010). The target application in these studies was production optimization, and the reduced-order model was used to provide results for varying well control parameters (bottomhole pressure or flow rates). "

These linkages, therefore, must be captured in thermal simulations. Although fully coupled thermal wellbore-/reservoir-flow simulators have been developed, the implementation of the thermal well model is somewhat complicated, and the simulations are computationally demanding. In this paper, we present a semianalytical treatment that enables the extension of existing isothermal wellbore-flow models to the nonisothermal case. The procedure entails the use of analytical solutions for wellbore temperature applied in conjunction with numerical solutions of the reservoir mass- and energy-balance equations coupled with wellbore mass- and momentum-balance equations. The approach thus enables a degree of decoupling between the wellbore flow and energy problems. We proceed by first presenting analytical solutions for wellbore temperature, developed under various assumptions (these basic solutions have been obtained previously). We then describe the use of one of these solutions, which allows for general variation of in-situ phase fraction and other properties along the wellbore, within the semianalytical context. The implementation of the overall method into a general purpose research simulator is also described. Results are presented for several cases involving multiphase flow in monobore and multilateral wells. Close agreement with reference solutions, obtained from a fully coupled thermal wellbore/reservoir model, is demonstrated for all of the examples. The semianalytical treatment is additionally shown to provide comparable or improved computational efficiency relative to the fully coupled model. "

Thermal in-situ upgrading processes for producing hydrocarbons from oil shale have gained attention recently, however, in part because of promising results reported by Shell using its in-situ conversion process (Crawford et al. 2008). This and similar processes entail heating the oil shale to approximately 700\u00b0F (371\u00b0C), where the kerogen in the shale decomposes through a series of chemical reactions into liquid and gas products. In this paper, we present a detailed numerical formulation of the in-situ upgrading process. Our model, which can be characterized as a thermal/compositional, chemical reaction, and flow formulation, is implemented into Stanford's General Purpose Research Simulator (GPRS). The formulation includes strongly temperature-dependent kinetic reactions, fully compositional flow and transport, and a model for the introduction of heat into the formation through downhole heaters. We present detailed simulation results for representative systems. The model and heating patterns are based on information in Shell publications; chemical-reaction and thermodynamic data are from previously reported pyrolysis experiments. After a relatively modest degree of parameter adjustment (with parameters restricted to physically realistic ranges), our results for oil and gas production are in reasonable agreement with available field data. We also investigate various sensitivities and show how production is affected by heater temperature and location. The ability to model these effects will be essential for the eventual design and optimization of in-situ upgrading operations. "

For this reason, reduced-order modeling procedures, which are a family of techniques that enable highly efficient simulations, may be very useful for optimization problems. In this paper, we describe a recently developed reduced-order modeling (ROM) technique that has been used in other application areas, the trajectory piecewise linearization (TPWL) procedure, and incorporate it in production-optimization computations. The TPWL methodology represents solutions encountered during the optimization runs in terms of Taylor-series expansions around previously simulated states. This requires a small number of preprocessing (training) simulations using the full (high-fidelity) model, during which pressure and saturation states and Jacobian matrices are saved. These states and matrices are then projected into a low-dimensional space using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Simulations in this reduced space can be performed very efficiently; in this work, we observe runtime speedups of a factor of 450. Overall speedups are, however, less because of the preprocessing overhead. We assess the TPWL representation for simulations of waterflood in a heterogeneous 3D model containing more than 20,000 gridblocks and six wells. The high degree of accuracy of the TPWL model is first demonstrated for several testing simulations in which producer- and injector-well settings differ from those used in the training runs. The TPWL representations are then used in optimizations involving the determination of optimal bottomhole pressures (BHPs) for a reservoir model with four production wells and two injection wells. A gradient-based algorithm is applied for the optimizations. In the first case, the BHPs of the producers and injectors are optimized at six different times (36 control variables) and in the second case at 15 different times (90 control variables). Results for optimized net present value (NPV) using TPWL are shown to be in consistently close agreement with those computed using high-fidelity simulations. Most significantly, when the optimal well settings obtained using the TPWL procedure are applied in high-fidelity models, the resulting NPVs are within approximately 0.5% of the values determined using the high-fidelity simulations. Our overall conclusion is that the TPWL representation may be quite useful in production-optimization problems. "

Finally, the TPWL procedure is applied to a computationally demanding multiobjective optimization problem, for which the Pareto front is determined. Limited high-fidelity simulations demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of TPWL for this optimization. Future work should focus on error estimation and on stabilizing the method for large models with significant density differences between phases. "

                    "title": "Modeling of Multisegmented Thermal Wells in Reservoir Simulation",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Advanced wells are being used more and more frequently to improve the economics of oil field operations. Such wells can contact larger regions of the reservoir than is possible with standard wells. Because these wells can be very long, pressure drop along the well and temperature effects (in thermal problems) can became quite important. Modeling of advanced wells where thermal effects need to be included is a difficult task, and available models are often limited in their capabilities or are inefficient.  A suitable model should be able to handle complicated well trajectories, heat transfer to and from the well, the hold-up of fluids due to slip between phases, and pressure change due to friction. This paper presents a comprehensive multisegmented well model that includes these features. The model has been implemented in Stanford's General Purpose Research Simulator (GPRS). It calculates both pressure and temperature profiles along the well for standard wells and wells with complicated trajectories. One of the advantages of our model is that both homogeneous (no slip) and drift-flux flow models can be used to determine phase distribution within the well. The hydrocarbon fluids can be described either through a black oil representation or using a general compositional model with an arbitrary number of components. The proposed multisegmented well model was tested with a number of challenging and realistic examples. Our results show that the model is stable and in most cases converges in only a few iterations even with reasonably large time steps. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated using three examples. The first example involves a vertical production well with the fluid represented in terms of six hydrocarbon components and water. For this case we demonstrate the importance of slip between phases. The second example is for a thermal multilateral well with two branches and a fluid with three hydrocarbon components. The third example shows our ability to model phase appearance and disappearance in the wellbore and demonstrates the impact of temperature on oil and gas rates during production.  Introduction The use of horizontal and multilateral wells has become a standard practice in the oil and gas industry. However, modeling of such wells is still a challenge in many cases. This is because many complex phenomena must be taken into account for the correct representation of such wells; among them are the complicated trajectory of the well, pressure drop due to friction, slip between phases, and the temperature distribution in the well. Modeling of thermal effects is necessary for simulating oil recovery from unconventional resources such as oil sands and shales. Further, such models can be used for the interpretation of data from distributed temperature sensors (DTS).  Significant effort has been directed towards the modelling of thermal wells, starting from analytical models proposed by, e.g., Ramey (1962) and Hasan and Kabir (2002), to complicated numerical models, such as those proposed by Shirdel and Sepehrnoori (2009) and Stone et al. (2002). All available models have advantages and disadvantages: some cannot model pressure loss due to friction, slip between phases or complicated well trajectories; some are not accurate or fast enough, and some are too complicated for routine use.

Gas-bubble size, often referred to as foam texture, determines gas-flow behavior in porous media. A population-balance model has been developed previously for modeling foam texture and flow in porous media. The model incorporates pore-level mechanisms of foam-bubble generation, coalescence, and transport. Here, we propose a simplified foam model to reduce computational costs. The formulation is based on the assumption of local equilibrium of foam generation and coalescence and is applicable to high- and low-quality foams. The proposed foam model is compatible with a standard reservoir simulator. It provides a potentially useful, efficient tool to predict foam flows accurately at the field scale for designing and managing foamed-gas applications. There are three main contributions of this paper. First, foam-displacement experiments in a linear sandstone core are conducted. A visualization cell is employed to measure the effluent foam-bubble sizes for a transient flow as well as to estimate the in-situ foam-bubble sizes along the length of the core during steady-state flow. These appear to be the first measurements of foam-bubble texture in the entrance region of a core. Additionally, the evolution of aqueous-phase saturation is monitored using X-ray computed tomography (CT), and the pressure profile is measured by a series of pressure taps. Second, the population-balance representation of foam generation by gas-bubble snap-off is modified to extend the capability of the population-balance approach to predict foam-flow behaviors in both the so-called high-quality and low-quality regimes. Third, a simplified population-balance model is developed and implemented with the local-equilibrium approximation. Good agreement is found between the experimental results and the predictions of the simplified model, with a minor mismatch in the entrance region. "

                    "abstract": "In-situ combustion (ISC) possesses advantages over surface-generated steam injection for deep reservoirs in terms of wellbore heat losses and generation of heat above the critical point of water. ISC also has dramatically lower requirements for water and natural gas, and potentially a smaller surface footprint, in comparison with steam. In spite of its apparent advantages, prediction of the likelihood of successful ISC is unclear. Conventionally, combustion tube tests of a crude oil and rock are used to infer that ISC works at reservoir scale and estimate the oxygen requirements. Combustion tube results may lead to field-scale simulation on a coarse grid with upscaled Arrhenius reaction kinetics. As an alternative, we suggest a comprehensive workflow to predict successful combustion at the reservoir scale. The method is derived from experimental laboratory data and simulation models at all scales. In our workflow, a sample of crushed reservoir rock or an equivalent synthetic sample is mixed with water/brine and the crude-oil sample. The mixture is placed in a kinetics cell reactor and oxidized at different heating rates. An isoconversional method is used to estimate kinetic parameters vs. temperature and combustion characteristics of the sample. Results from the isoconversional interpretation provide a first screen of the likelihood that a combustion front is propagated successfully. Then, a full-physics simulation of the kinetics cell experiment is used to predict the flue gas composition. The model combines a detailed pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) analysis of the multiphase system and a multistep reaction model. A mixture identical to that tested in the kinetics cell is also burned in a combustion tube experiment. Temperature profiles along the tube, as well as the flue gas compositions, are measured during the experiment. A high-resolution simulation model of the combustion tube test is developed and validated. Finally, the high-resolution model is used as a basis for scaling up the reaction model to field dimensions. Field-scale simulations do not use Arrhenius kinetics. As a result, significant stiffness is removed from the finite-difference simulation of the governing equations. Preliminary field-scale simulation shows little sensitivity to gridblock size, and the computational work per timestep is much reduced. "

                    "title": "Improving Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage Using Mobility Control Foams: Foam Assisted-SAGD (FA-SAGD",
                    "abstract": "Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a promising approach for recovering heavy and viscous oil.\u00a0 The success of SAGD relies on two key operations: uniform formation of the steam chamber along the full length of the injector, and effective control of steam breakthrough by sustaining a liquid level between the injector and producer (i.e. a steam trap).\u00a0 Intrinsic permeability heterogeneities typically lead to a partially-developed steam chamber and potentially low sweep efficiency that results in reduced oil production. The injectivity variability along the well also complicates the control of steam breakthrough. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the use of foamed steam. The feasibility of foam-assisted SAGD (FA-SAGD) is demonstrated numerically with a local-equilibrium foam simulator incorporating the physical mechanisms of foam generation, destruction, and transport. The model was validated previously. Simulation results show that strong foam is generated and accumulates in the interwell region.\u00a0 The presence of foamed steam helps to control steam breakthrough and yields better recovery performance per barrel of steam injected than conventional SAGD. Live steam production in simulations is reduced by a factor of 5. Consequently, cumulative oil production is increased by about 30% in comparison to cases without foam. Sensitivity analysis of the parameters describing foam indicate that the process is robust. Introduction Vast quantities of heavy and extra-heavy oil (bitumen) resources have been found worldwide. For example, an estimated original heavy oil in place of more than 1.8 trillion barrels is present in Venezuela, 1.7 trillion barrels in Alberta, Canada, and 20-25 billion barrels on the North Slope of Alaska, USA (Burton et al., 2005). Due to large crude oil viscosity, the efficient and economic recovery of these heavy-oil and bitumen resources presents a significant challenge. At reservoir conditions, heavy oil normally has viscosity much greater than 100 cp, and bitumen exhibits even greater viscosity. With such large viscosity, crude oil flows extremely slowly, if at all, at initial formation temperatures. Thus, the recovery of the unconventional heavy oil requires efficient in-situ viscosity reduction. Thermal methods have been developed extensively over the past several decades for heavy-oil recovery. \u00a0To date, more than 4 billion bbl of oil have been recovered in the USA alone as a result of steam injection (Moritis 2002). The essential idea of thermal recovery is to heat reservoir fluids thereby reducing oil viscosity according to the strong temperature dependency of oil viscosity (Bradley, 1987). Conventional thermal methods include cyclic steam injection, steam flooding, and in-situ combustion. To some extent, these methods all use gravity gravity drainage to recover oil (e.g. Aziz and Gontijo, 1984; Closmann, 1995). With recent advances in drilling horizontal wells and the understanding of the importance of gravity drainage to heavy-oil recovery, so-called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has emerged as a promising heavy-oil recovery technique, especially for bitumen in Western Canada (Butler, 2001). The concept of SAGD, initially proposed by Butler and his colleagues (Butler et al.,1981; Butler and Stephens, 1981), places two horizontal wells close to the bottom of a formation. The injection well is above the producer a short vertical distance (4-10 m). Steam is injected continuously into the upper well, and rises in the formation, forming a steam chamber. Cold oil surrounding the steam chamber is heated by thermal conduction and by mixing with warm oil. As oil temperature increases, it becomes mobile and flows together with condensate toward the producer (Butler, 1998b). The SAGD technique enjoys advantages over other thermal methods including shortcomings of steam override by employing only gravity as the driving mechanism. This leads to a more stable displacement, good drainage efficiency, and a high oil recovery. SAGD also benefits from the substantial contact of the horizontal well with the formation. Moreover, in the SAGD process, the heated oil remains hot and movable as it flows toward the production well. "

Introduction In-situ combustion (ISC) is an enhanced oil recovery method in which air is injected to the reservoir. The heat generated by combustion reactions mainly contributes to enhanced oil recovery by reducing crude-oil viscosity and drive energy through pressurization that results in a vigorous gas drive. Combustion of a crude-oil, that is composed of a large number of components, is complex and cannot be exhaustively characterized. These combustion reactions result in significant increase in temperature (Prats, 1982). Large temperature difference signifies heat transfer and results in phase change. Thus, ISC is a strongly coupled reactive transport process whose modelling is complex. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Experimental design is a widely used statistical method for understanding the factors that impact an information gathering exercise such as mechanistic simulations. It is used here to gain insight into flow and operating conditions that affect in-situ combustion. Specifically, experimental design was applied to understand in-situ combustion of very heavy oil using a commercial thermal simulator. The design parameters investigated were selected based on combustion laboratory results and literature. These included activation energies of the reaction schemes, oil saturation, air injection rate and pressure control at the producer. A full factorial design was used to create the parametric space considering interactions between the parameters.  The degree to which the combustion peak temperature, pressure, combustion front speed, recovery efficiency and coke deposited changed was used to determine the most critical parameters. Results showed the activation energy of the coke deposition reaction had the greatest influence on the combustion process. For the 3-reaction pathway assumed for crude-oil combustion, a slight increase in this activation energy inhibited the combustion reactions. The injection pressure of the system was impacted significantly by the initial oil saturation while the speed at which the front propagated was shown to be primarily a function of the air injection rate. Results also showed that for a given initial oil saturation, a limiting air flux existed below which oil plugging of the linear system occured. Given successful ignition and propagation of the front, optimal recovery was obtained between initial oil saturations of 45-70%. We also observed interaction between the parameters. The effect of the activation energy of the combustion reaction on the recovery was strongly dependent on the amount of oil initially in place.  Recovery decreased with increasing activation energy at lower initial saturations, but was independent of activation energy at greater initial saturations. In addition, the velocity profile showed different incremental oil recovery rates with different initial oil saturation.  Introduction With increasingly inexpensive computational resources, there is a growing desire to capture complex physics in reservoir simulator models. Given that the measurements of parameters in the earth sciences are error prone, the outputs of the simulators are subject to a degree of uncertainty. It is this uncertainty we seek to understand. Previously, such a study would have been prohibitively expensive computationally. Thanks to affordable computer hardware and sophisticated software, however, it is now possible to shed light on the impact of uncertainty on realistic in-situ combustion models by conducting indepth sensitivity analysis studies.  The use of experimental design has risen in the oil and gas industry for screening experiments and management decisions (Ogbalor and Peacock, 2010). Examples of oil and gas processes in which experimental design has been implemented include waterflooding, gas-field development, reservoir simulation analysis, and risk evaluations (Ibiada et al., 2010, Spokes et al., 2004, Esmaiel et al., 2005, Ezekwe and Filler, 2005). In each case, the influential uncertain parameters were identified and response surfaces created. Quantification of the risks associated was then used in economic models for decision analysis. Experimental design has also been applied in the assessment of heavy-oil recovery (Prada et al., 2005). Prada et al. estimated the expected monetary value of a project using the probabilities of the uncertain parameters and the estimated net present value for varying geological scenarios. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, we extend our previous work on thermal streamline simulation to steam floods. Steam floods exhibit large volume changes and compressibility associated with the phase behavior of steam, strong gravity segregation and override, and highly coupled energy and mass transport. To overcome these challenges we implement a pressure update along the streamlines and a Glowinski -scheme operator splitting. We tested our streamline simulator on a 2D horizontal quarter- five-spot steam flood, a 2D vertical cross section steam flood with gravity override, and a 2D multi-well example. We compared our thermal streamline results with those computed by a commercial finite-volume thermal simulator on both accuracy and efficiency. For the cases investigated, we are able to retain solution accuracy while reducing computational cost and gaining connectivity information from the streamlines, which is useful for reservoir engineering purposes.  Introduction A large part of the world oil reserves exists in the form of heavy oils. The development of such reserves by traditional methods (primary depletion, water flood) is often inefficient due to the high viscosity of the heavy oil. Thermal recovery processes, which rely on viscosity reduction of the oil through heat that is injected (steam or hot water) or generated in-situ (in-situ combustion), are well suited for unlocking these resources. Planning and management generally make use of finite volume (FV) thermal reservoir simulations. However, the computational cost is usually high because of the strongly nonlinear and coupled nature of the governing equations. Running optimization and/or sensitivity studies for realistic reservoir settings on grid resolution fine enough to capture critical physics becomes prohibitive.  In other applications, streamline-based flow simulation has been successfully applied to reduce computational costs whilst retaining accuracy. Applications include the simulation of water floods (Batycky et al., 1997; Martin and Wegner, 1979), compositional gas injection (Crane et al., 2000; Gerritsen et al., 2005; Thiele et al., 1997) and polymer flooding (Clemens et al., 2010). Streamline simulation has also been extended to account for compressible fluid and rock properties (Beraldo et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2006). The computational efficiency of streamline simulation is especially suitable for workflows involving many simulations as might be the case in history matching and optimization problems, and commercial streamline simulation is applied for such purposes (Thiele and Batycky, 2006). In our previous work (Zhu et al., 2010) we developed a streamline simulation framework for hot water flooding. \u00a0Here, we explore extension of streamline simulation to steam flooding. If possible, it will give a fast and effective simulator that gives sufficient accuracy for common reservoir simulation studies. "

This approach is simple, but the disadvantage is that numerical errors become highly correlated with the underlying computational grid. In many real-field applications, this can result in strong sensitivity to grid design not only for the computed saturation/composition fields but also for critical integrated data such as breakthrough times. Therefore, to increase robustness of simulators, especially for adverse-mobility-ratio flows that arise in a variety of enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) processes, it is of much interest to design truly multidimensional schemes for transport that remove, or at least strongly reduce, the sensitivity to grid design. We present a new upstream-biased truly multidimensional family of schemes for multiphase transport capable of handling countercurrent flow arising from gravity. The proposed family of schemes has four attractive properties: applicability within a variety of simulation formulations with varying levels of implicitness, extensibility to general grid topologies, compatibility with any finite-volume flow discretization, and provable stability (monotonicity) for multiphase transport. The family is sufficiently expressive to include several previously developed multidimensional schemes, such as the narrow scheme, in a manner appropriate for general-purpose reservoir simulation. A number of waterflooding problems in homogeneous and heterogeneous media demonstrate the robustness of the method as well as reduced transverse (cross-wind) diffusion and grid-orientation effects. "

                    "abstract": "History matching with uncertainty quantification has been a topic of great interest over the last 10 years, with many algorithmic approaches developed, and many applications presented. Most of the applications focus on the uncertainty in the petrophysical properties of the reservoir, as that is by far the easiest to parameterise. There are few papers that address the topic of structural uncertainty quantification, yet that is potentially the biggest component of subsurface uncertainty. The principal problem in accounting for structural uncertainty is the difficulty in parameterising subsurface structures, automatically gridding the reservoir model and ensuring that the grid will simulate in a reasonable time. This paper presents a new approach to structural uncertainty quantification. We have adapted the immersed interface method from computational mechanics, used to model fluid flow in domains with moving boundaries, to reservoir simulation. The immersed interface method is used with an extended multipoint flux approximation to completely decouple the parameterisation of structural features from their representation on the grid. Using this new technique, we are easily able to history match a 2D synthetic case where we simultaneously vary the top and bottom surfaces of a reservoir, the location and orientation of faults within the reservoir, and the location and size of pinchouts.

                    "abstract": "The degenerate parabolic Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) poses numerical challenges due to self-sharpening and its sharp corner solutions. For these problems, we show results for two subclasses of the GPME with differentiable k(p) with respect to p, namely the Porous Medium Equation (PME) and the superslow diffusion equation. Spurious temporal oscillations, and nonphysical locking and lagging have been reported in the literature. These issues have been attributed to harmonic averaging of the coefficient k(p) for small p, and arithmetic averaging has been suggested as an alternative. We show that harmonic averaging is not solely responsible and that an improved discretization can mitigate these issues. Here, we investigate the causes of these numerical artifacts using modified equation analysis. The modified equation framework can be used for any type of discretization. We show results for the second order finite volume method. The observed problems with harmonic averaging can be traced to two leading error terms in its modified equation. This is also illustrated numerically through a Modified Harmonic Method (MHM) that can locally modify the critical terms to remove the aforementioned numerical artifacts. "

                    "abstract": "Numerical discretizations of the Generalized Porous Medium Equation (GPME) with discontinuous coefficients are analyzed with respect to the formation of numerical artifacts. In addition to the degeneracy and self-sharpening of the GPME with continuous coefficients, detailed in [1], increased numerical challenges occur in the discontinuous coefficients case. These numerical challenges manifest themselves in spurious temporal oscillations in second order finite volume discretizations with both arithmetic and harmonic averaging. The integral average, developed in [2], leads to improved solutions with monotone and reduced amplitude temporal oscillations. In this paper, we propose a new method called the Shock-Based Averaging Method (SAM) that incorporates the shock position into the numerical scheme. The shock position is numerically calculated by discretizing the theoretical speed of the front from the GPME theory. The speed satisfies the jump condition for integral conservation laws. SAM results in a non-oscillatory temporal profile, producing physically valid numerical results. We use SAM to demonstrate that the choice of averaging alone is not the cause of the oscillations, and that the shock position must be a part of the numerical scheme to avoid the artifacts. "

Rather than modeling the subgrid tensor that appears in the LES formulation as is commonly done, the subgrid force vector, which is the divergence of the subgrid tensor, is modeled directly. It is designed to comply with two basic principles. First, it is required to act only on the smallest scales that the mesh can represent. Second, it must be of an advective nature, which means it must have a preferred direction aligned with the fluid velocity. The results for two benchmark test cases, including Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence and Turbulent Channel Flow, show that this approach can successfully represent the effect of the small scales on the resolved ones, while guaranteeing numerical stability and greater robustness in adverse mesh environments, when compared to some traditional eddy-viscosity based models, such as the Smagorinsky and the dynamic model from Germano.

                    "abstract": "For nearly thirty years, the Triassic marine carbonate Shublik Formation has been suggested and confirmed as a key source rock for hydrocarbons in the North Slope of Alaska. The formation accounts for roughly one third of the oil in the supergiant Prudhoe Bay Field, and for nearly all of the oil in the second largest Kuparuk River Field. Recent studies of oil types in the vicinity of the Northstar Field suggested presence of \u201cshaly\u201d organofacies of the Shublik Formation based on the likely Triassic age and marine shale biomarker signatures of some analyzed oil samples. The current work fills the gap between biomarker analysis of predicted \u201ccalcareous\u201d and \u201cshaly\u201d oil types and source rock geochemistry. Biomarker-based oil-source rock correlation confirms the presence of two genetically-distinct organofacies and related oil families. Both groups were deposited under a similar redox condition (anoxic to suboxic) with dominantly marine algal input but in either (1) a clay-rich or (2) a clay-poor depositional setting. Chemometric evaluation of multivariate biomarker data reveals mixtures with variable degrees of mixing between end members. Analysis of diamondoids confirms mixed oil types and establishes diamondoid signatures of source rock end-members. This allows for correlation of biomarker-poor, overmature Shublik source rock samples to oils, and extends these interpretations over large areas of the North Slope. "

Recovered continuous core is nearly 90\u202fm thick continuous section throughout the entire Shublik Formation. Guided by previously published analyses of the Phoenix-1 core by Robison et al. (1996), this study provides the most detailed core-based analysis of the Shublik Formation to date. Analysis of biomarkers and diamondoids combined with Rock-Eval pyrolysis results indicates evidence of mature migrated hydrocarbons that may have affected previous interpretations of organic matter type and maturity of this core. Despite the variable lithology, four identified source rock intervals contain oil-prone type I kerogens with maturity ranging from immature to marginally mature. Biomarker analysis indicates the presence of two organic facies deposited under anoxic clay-poor and suboxic clay-rich environments that likely generated genetically distinct oils. "

                    "abstract": "Mass-transport deposits (MTDs) generate seafloor topography that can strongly influence the stratigraphic architecture of submarine channels. In deep-water depositional environments, both MTDs and turbidity currents are commonly fed into basins from a single point source, and turbidites may be observed ponding on top of, between, and beside MTDs. This study uses core data and 3D seismic reflection data to classify two major types of MTDs, 1) long-runout MTDs, which are radial in plan view and mounded, and 2) short-runout MTDs, which are elongate and weakly layered. Both MTD types deposited transversely into a deep-water axial channel belt in the lower Puchkirchen Formation in the Molasse Basin of Austria. Unlike longitudinally-emplaced MTDs previously identified in the upper Puchkirchen Formation, the surface topography of transversely-emplaced MTDs, especially those of the long-runout MTDs, provided accommodation for the ponding of sediments on a scale similar to that of large supra-MTD ponded turbidite intervals identified globally. Moreover, both types of transversely-emplaced MTDs enhanced syn-tectonic northward migration of the northern margin of the channel belt and delivered large quantities of fine-grained material that likely contributed to the mud-rich lithofacies that comprise a significant fraction of the lower Puchkirchen Formation. Our work suggests that supra-MTD ponded deposits could contain hydrocarbon reservoir units in regions previously regarded as waste zones. More broadly, this study characterizes how transversely-emplaced MTDs influence seafloor topography, submarine channel morphology, and the distribution of reservoir facies in a depositional system characterized by axial sediment transport.

This study presents bulk organic carbon isotopes (\u03b413Corg), elemental concentrations (XRF), and initial osmium ratios (187Os/188Os, Osi) from the Turonian\u2013Coniacian Qingshankou Formation, a \u223c5 Ma lacustrine mudstone succession in the Songliao Basin of northeast China. A notable \u03b413Corg excursion (\u223c+2.5\u2030) in organic carbon-lean Qingshankou Members 2\u20133 correlates to OAE3 in the Western Interior Basin (WIB) of North America within temporal uncertainty of high-precision age models. Decreases in carbon isotopic fractionation (\u039413C) through OAE3 in the WIB and Songliao Basin, suggest that significantly elevated global rates of organic carbon burial drew down pCO2, likely cooling climate. Despite this, Osi chemostratigraphy demonstrates no major changes in global volcanism or weathering trends through OAE3. Identification of OAE3 in a lake system is consistent with lacustrine records of other OAEs (e.g., Toarcian OAE), and underscores that terrestrial environments were sensitive to climate perturbations associated with OAEs. Additionally, the relatively radiogenic Osi chemostratigraphy and XRF data confirm that the Qingshankou Formation was deposited in a non-marine setting. Organic carbon-rich intervals preserve no compelling Osi evidence for marine incursions, an existing hypothesis for generating Member 1's prolific petroleum source rocks. Based on our results, we present a model for water column stratification and source rock deposition independent of marine incursions, detailing dominant biogeochemical cycles and lacustrine organic carbon burial mechanisms.

However, the processes dictating gully formation and the role of gullies in deep-water sediment transport are topics of debate. In this study, through 3D seismic reflection interpretation of Pliocene-Pleistocene continental slope strata in the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, we present results constraining the evolution of gullies over a roughly 2 million year timespan. We document gullies ranging from 20\u2013400\u00a0m wide, ~\u00a010\u201360\u00a0m deep, and 2\u201322\u00a0km long, on slopes ranging from 2\u00b0 to 5\u00b0. Gully width to depth ratios (3.5\u20135) are distinct from aspect ratios of submarine and fluvial channels (29.5 and 17), suggesting a process-based control on this morphometric relationship that could aid in predicting sediment transport styles from first order observations in datasets of modern or ancient seafloors. Gullies in this study commonly form nested complexes hundreds of meters thick, preserving patterns of aggradation, partial burial, and re-incision that highlight the long-lived nature of the gullies and their strong influence on subsequent turbidity flows. Gully longitudinal profiles are morphologically similar to slope interfluve profiles, suggesting that gullies are integral to slope sedimentation processes and that gully-forming flows are also the dominant drivers of continental slope sedimentation and outbuilding in this setting. We interpret these flows to be large, dilute, sheet-like turbidity currents, which produce net-aggradational, shallowly-incised gullies due to autogenic instabilities that promote regularly spaced variations in erosion and deposition. From the size and spacing of the gully arrays and the scale of sediment waves in the study area, we estimate these flows to have been at least tens of kilometers wide and up to 40\u00a0m thick. "

We present stable isotope (\u03b418O) and clumped isotope temperature (\u039447) records from a middle Eocene (41 to 40 Ma) high-elevation mammal fossil locality in the North American continental interior (Montana, USA). \u039447 paleotemperatures of soil carbonates delineate a rapid +9/\u221211\u2009\u00b0C temperature excursion in the paleosol record. \u039447 temperatures progressively increase from 23\u2009\u00b0C \u00b1 3\u2009\u00b0C to peak temperatures of 32\u2009\u00b0C \u00b1 3\u2009\u00b0C and subsequently drop by 11\u2009\u00b0C. This hyperthermal event in the middle Eocene is accompanied by low \u03b418O values and reduced pedogenic carbonate concentrations in paleosols. Based on laser ablation U/Pb geochronology of paleosol carbonates in combination with magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, stable isotope, and \u039447 evidence, we suggest that this pronounced warming event reflects the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) in western North America. The terrestrial expression of northern hemisphere MECO in western North America appears to be characterized by warmer and wetter (sub-humid) conditions, compared to the post-MECO phase. Large and rapid shifts in \u03b418O values of precipitation and pedogenic CaCO3 contents parallel temperature changes, indicating the profound impact of the MECO on atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns in the western North American continental interior during this transient warming event.

                    "abstract": "There remains substantial debate concerning the relative roles of tectonics and of global climate in pacing the evolution of aridity in Central Asia over the Cenozoic. Tibetan Plateau uplift, variable monsoonal strength, Paratethys retreat, and reduced moisture transport from the North Atlantic have all been hypothesized to drive aridity in Central Asia. Distinguishing between these mechanisms requires knowledge of moisture transport pathways to Central Asia through time. Presently, Central Asia receives recycled, high \u03b418O moisture that has been transported across Eurasia by the westerlies, while southern Tibet receives low \u03b418O moisture distilled by passage over the Himalaya. Here, we reconstruct the spatial distribution of oxygen isotopes in precipitation since the early Eocene, using a compilation of \u03b418O data from 2750 sedimentary carbonate samples. Across Asia, the spatial distribution of paleo-precipitation \u03b418O remains remarkably similar through time, with low \u03b418O values in the lee of the Himalaya in southern Tibet, constant, high \u03b418O values in Central Asia, and intermediate values on the central Plateau despite independent evidence for substantial changes in both topography and climate through time. These results suggest that a long-standing topographic feature has continuously blocked southerly moisture, and subsequent progressive uplift of the Tibetan Plateau has had little impact on Central Asian climate. In turn, southerly monsoonal moisture has never persistently extended northward of the central Plateau. As a result, the westerlies have remained the dominant moisture source in Central Asia since at least the early Eocene. Therefore, sedimentary aridity indicators in Central Asia, such as loess deposition, are controlled by the trans-Eurasian, westerly moisture flux rather than Tibetan Plateau uplift. "

                    "abstract": "This study presents a new depositional analysis of the stratigraphic architecture of a deep-water lobe system in a trench-slope basin setting by examining the upper Miocene Hikuwai sandstone and Mapiri Formation of the East Coast Basin (ECB) in the Tolaga Bay area, New Zealand. The Hikuwai sandstone is up to 385\u00a0m thick and is enveloped by the mud-rich middle and upper Mapiri Formation. Stratigraphic sections measured at centimeter-scale and high-resolution photo-panoramas were collected from sea-cliff exposures for stratigraphic and architectural analysis and definition of six lithofacies. The Hikuwai sandstone is interpreted to represent a succession of frontal lobe deposits that contain a distributary network of meter-scale erosional channels and scours on their surface. Lobe lithofacies depend on their proximity to the sediment source, and their proximity to a distributary channel and/or scour. The late Miocene basin setting is interpreted to be a weakly to moderately confined trench-slope basin. The basin configuration controlled the development of the depositional system through elongate fault-controlled ridges that directed sediment dispersal pathways through longitudinal troughs. The basin filled from north to south in four phases: 1) lobe aggradation related to healed slope accommodation, 2) retrogradation and lateral migration of the system 3) back-stepping of the system upslope causing reduced confinement and allowing flows to become wider, longer, and thinner, and 4) shut off of sediment supply and mass wasting of the upper Mapiri Formation, representing either renewed fault movement or equilibration of the system to the regional slope profile. This paper provides a detailed description of the internal structure of lobes in a trench-slope setting, and a depositional model that relates lobe lithofacies to the filling of healed slope accommodation. Therefore, this work presents an analog applicable for elongate basins, such as in the trench slope or settings with mud diapirism, where only seismic-scale or limited data is available. "

                    "abstract": "The surface uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) offers a key testing ground for evaluating models of collisional tectonics and holds important implications for processes ranging from global cooling to the onset of the Asian monsoon. Various models have been proposed to reveal the surface uplift history of the TP, but controversies remain. We evaluate these models using data from sedimentology and stratigraphy, structural geology, magmatism, exhumation, and paleoaltimetry studies. Structural analyses indicate that thrust belts, which spread from the central TP outward toward its surrounding margins, accommodated most of the India\u2013Asia convergence, and facilitated crustal shortening and thickening in the central TP. Eocene adakitic rocks located in the Qiangtang and the Lhasa blocks likely were generated by partial melting of an eclogitic source. Paleogene (50\u201330\u00a0Ma) potassic rocks only occur in the Qiangtang block, whereas Late Oligocene\u2013Late Miocene (26\u20138\u00a0Ma) potassic rocks occur both in the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks. Low-temperature thermochronologic ages in the central TP are older than 40\u201335\u00a0Ma, whereas those in the margins are younger than 20\u00a0Ma (mostly Late Miocene, and Pliocene/Pleistocene in age). Independent paleoaltimetry estimates suggest that the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes attained their current elevations during the Eocene, most likely due to the initial collision between India and Lhasa, whereas the Hoh Xil basin area to the north and Himalayas to the south were still low, even below sea level in the latter case. We argue for an inside-out growth pattern for the Tibetan Plateau. The TP grew southward and northward from a nucleus of high topography and is likely to continue expanding along the Mazar Tagh fault to the northwest, the Kuantai Shan-Hei Shan-Longshou Shan to the northeast, the Longquan Shan to the east and the Shillong plateau to the south if the northward force of India would not diminished.

                    "abstract": "The Vallecitos syncline is a westerly structural extension of the San Joaquin Basin. The Vallecitos oil field, comprised of eight separate areas that produce from Cretaceous and Paleogene reservoirs, accounted for 5.4 MMB of oil and 5.6 BCF associated of gas through 2010. However, exploration for oil and gas in the Vallecitos area is challenging due to structural complexity and limited data. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether source rocks are actively generating petroleum in the Vallecitos syncline and to improve our understanding of burial history and timing of hydrocarbon generation. We conducted biomarker analysis on twenty-two oil samples from the Vallecitos syncline. Source-related biomarkers show two genetic groups of oil, which originated from two different source rocks. These results differ from earlier published interpretations in which the Kreyenhagen Formation is the only source rock in the Vallecitos syncline, and suggest that the Cretaceous Moreno Formation in the syncline also is an active source rock. Stratigraphic evidence and modeling suggest that late Cenozoic episodes of erosion due to folding and uplift removed significant overburden on the flanks of the syncline. To better understand the petroleum systems and clarify the total active source rocks in the area, 2D burial histories were generated through the Vallecitos syncline. A published cross-section through the deepest part of the syncline was selected to conduct thermal history, basin evolution, and migration analyses. The 2D model results indicate that the lower Kreyenhagen Formation has various maturities within the formation at different locations in the present-day syncline. The basal part of the Kreyenhagen Formation is in the dry gas window and maturity decreases away from the central part to the flanks. It remains immature along shallow portions of the present-day flanks. In contrast, the basal part of the Moreno Formation achieved extremely high maturity (past the gas generation zone) but is in the oil generation zone on the flanks of the syncline at shallow depth. All of our geochemical and 2D model results suggest that there are two active source rocks in the Vallecitos syncline. Accordingly, we propose that there are two active petroleum systems in the Vallecitos syncline. "

                    "abstract": "Cretaceous climate data of the long-lived Cretaceous Songliao Basin (SB) in eastern Asia is correlated and compared with the Western Interior Seaway (WIS) on the northern American plate, in order to understand better the dynamics of the Earth's past \u2018greenhouse\u2019 climates. Nearly continuous Late Cretaceous terrestrial deposition in the Songliao Basin is represented by two cores totaling 2431\u00a0m in length. The Turonian\u2013Maastrichtian age of the section is based on integrated stratigraphy, and is comparable in age with Upper Cretaceous strata in the WIS. Being consistent with global trends, the dynamic Late Cretaceous climates of both the SB and WIS gradually cooled from the warmest Albian\u2013Cenomanian time to the end of the Maastrichtian with several intervening warm periods as did the global climate. However regional differences existed, the Songliao Basin climate was humid to semi-humid, warm temperate\u2013subtropical and the Western Interior Seaway was in the humid, warm temperate zone and experienced only moderate climatic changes. The shifts of oxygen isotope data in the Songliao Basin were frequent and abrupt, whereas WIS records more gradual change affected mainly by fresh-water runoff mixing with southern Tethyan and northern Arctic waters. Sedimentary cycles of eccentricity, obliquity and precession bands are recorded in both the SB and WIS basins. The sedimentary cycles in the WIS and SB are interpreted to be related to variations of the wet/dry runoff cycles, which indicate that orbital forcing played an important role in global climate change in Late Cretaceous. The most favorable condition for organic carbon burial in both the SB and WIS basin was bottom water anoxia regardless of the cause of the anoxia. But the organic carbon burial rate was usually much higher in the Songliao Lake than in the WI epeiric sea suggesting that giant lakes may serve as important sinks of atmospheric CO2. In both basins organic-rich deposits formed during a rise in water level and incursion of saline waters. The integration of paleoclimate data from Cretaceous marine deposits and terrestrial sedimentary record will promote our understanding of the Cretaceous \u2018greenhouse\u2019 climate change and may provide insights for a future greenhouse world.

The recovered cores will provide unique opportunities for the geosciences community to advance the understanding of climate change in the Cretaceous greenhouse world, and provide a documentation of geological events relevant to the carbon cycle during this time period. This drilling project will address significant geological questions, such as the identification of important stratigraphic boundaries and the marine-terrestrial correlations of stratigraphy, the reasons for the biotic response to the terrestrial environmental changes, the terrestrial response to the Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events, the formation of terrestrial petroleum source rocks, and the mechanisms for the Cretaceous magnetic Normal Superchron (CNS). In the first stage of this drilling project, the SKI drilling, rock cores of 2485.89\u00a0m in total length were recovered and the recovery ratio reached 96.46%. A series of drilling and coring technologies including regular, confined, directional, and sealed coring, were utilized to ensure a higher recovery ratio for the core, and will be described at the end of this paper. Well loggings were conducted right after coring. Core handling and storage were arranged in such a way that the scientific research was conducted on half of each core, whereas the other half of each core was preserved for long-term storage. The upcoming second stage, the SKII drilling, will combine with data from the existing SKI to provide complete high-resolution climate records of the terrestrial environment for the whole Cretaceous time period.

                    "abstract": "Because of the need to understand the links and feedbacks of the carbon cycle during times of global greenhouse conditions numerous studies have focused on the Cretaceous climate. Much of what we know about this warm period in Earth's history comes from the study of ocean sediments recovered from both ocean drill cores and marine sediments exposed at the Earth's surface. In contrast, there are few studies of Cretaceous terrestrial sediments. The Songliao basin located in northeast China offers a unique opportunity to understand Cretaceous paleoclimate of terrestrial settings because it contains a nearly complete record of lacustrine sediments deposited throughout the Cretaceous and there is an active drilling program to recover core from this paleolake. We present carbon, oxygen and strontium isotopic data from ostracods collected from two drill cores (SK-1 (N) and SK-1 (S)) that cover a time interval that extends from the Turonian through the Maastrichtian. These data record robust isotopic trends with numerous carbon and oxygen isotope shifts that are both rapid and long-term. We tentatively interpret this record to reflect changes in both global climate and regional basin evolution. In the Turonian and Coniacian Qingshankou Formation we observe several carbon isotope shifts that appear to be correlative to marine isotopic records based upon timing and magnitude of the isotopic changes. We suggest that the carbon isotope record in the Songliao basin reflect the decrease in carbon isotope ratios following the strong positive excursion at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, a positive isotope excursion in the late Turonian, and the negative isotope shift that occurs at the Turonian/Coniacian boundary. Upward in the section, however, the marine and Songliao isotopic records diverge as sediment sources shift from the southwest, east and north to more northerly. Strontium isotopes record the change in source region as they increase markedly between the Coniacian/Santonian Yaojia and Santonian/Campanian Nenjiang Formations. As this is the first isotopic record of the Songliao basin we are cautious about many of our interpretations of these isotopic data. Yet it is clear that with tighter age constraints and focused sampling centered on many of the isotope excursions presented here will allow for a deeper understanding of the terrestrial response to changing climate and the hydrologic response to basin evolution.

                    "abstract": "Modeling of thermal multiphase fluid flow in subsurface porous media poses significant difficulties for nonlinear solvers. These difficulties are a result of the strong coupling between the mass and energy conservation equations through the thermodynamic relationships. In particular, for geothermal problems, this tight coupling results in an apparent \u201cnegative compressibility\u201d for cells (control volumes) that have two fluid phases (liquid and vapor) during the time interval of interest. This behavior is associated with the flow of cold water into a cell that is at saturated conditions. As steam condensation occurs, the reduction in fluid volume due to the phase change is larger than the expansion of the liquid and vapor due to injection. As a result, the cell pressure decreases as condensation proceeds. This pressure decrease leads to an increase in the inflow of cold water until the condensation is complete. During the condensation period, the overall compressibility of the system is negative, and this poses serious convergence problems even when a fully implicit (i.e., backward Euler) time discretization is used. In order to deal with this problem, nonlinear solvers must be modified. In this work, we present a nonlinear solution strategy that overcomes the negative compressibility associated with the condensation front. We first consider a single-cell problem that demonstrates the negative compressibility phenomenon. Then, we describe a solution strategy that overcomes the nonlinear convergence difficulties. We then derive a criterion that can be used as a nonlinear preconditioning strategy to solve multicell problems. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear solution scheme is then demonstrated for more complex models. It was found that for one-dimensional problems, this nonlinear solution strategy converges for all timesteps sizes, while the fully coupled strategy only converges for a limited sized timestep. Furthermore, for a two-dimensional heterogeneous problem, the largest Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) number for this method is at least an order of magnitude larger than the CFL number that can be used with the fully coupled approach.

                    "abstract": "The Fenton Hill enhanced geothermal system (EGS) test site was the first of its kind, and interpretations of field observations from the project have influenced the past four decades of EGS development. In this study, we hypothesized that stimulation (i.e., permeability enhancement) in the Fenton Hill reservoir occurred through a mixed-mechanism process that involved propagation of hydraulic splay fractures encouraged by the stress changes induced as natural fractures opened and failed in shear. We used a hydromechanical fractured reservoir numerical model to validate the efficacy of the mixed-mechanism stimulation conceptual model. Our modeling results were consistent with the observations recorded during the Fenton Hill field experiments in three distinct ways: (1) a marked increase in injectivity occurred at a threshold injection pressure, (2) the near wellbore injectivity enhancement following each stimulation treatment was reversible, and (3) seismicity propagated in a direction that was inconsistent with the orientation of the maximum principal stress, despite injection having occurred at pressures significantly above the fracturing pressure. The modeling results demonstrate that several independent hydromechanical observations could be replicated by the mixed-mechanism stimulation conceptual model. In contrast, the observations could not be explained by a pure mode-I hydraulic fracture propagation nor by pure shear stimulation. Distinct fracture sets are activated through the mixed-mechanism stimulation process; the natural fractures provide most of the heat transfer surface area, and the tensile splay fractures form the bulk of the fluid storage volume. Future EGS projects could take advantage of mixed-mechanism stimulation to design wellbore completion and reservoir engineering and strategies to increase effective transmissivity, improve heat mining efficiency, and extend useful reservoir lifetime.

                    "abstract": "The maximum expected earthquake magnitude is an important parameter in seismic hazard and risk analysis because of its strong influence on ground motion. In the context of injection-induced seismicity, the processes that control how large an earthquake will grow may be influenced by operational factors under engineering control as well as natural tectonic factors. Determining the relative influence of these effects on maximum magnitude will impact the design and implementation of induced seismicity management strategies. In this work, we apply a numerical model that considers the coupled interactions of fluid flow in faulted porous media and quasidynamic elasticity to investigate the earthquake nucleation, rupture, and arrest processes for cases of induced seismicity. We find that under certain conditions, earthquake ruptures are confined to a pressurized region along the fault with a length-scale that is set by injection operations. However, earthquakes are sometimes able to propagate as sustained ruptures outside of the zone that experienced a pressure perturbation. We propose a faulting criterion that depends primarily on the state of stress and the earthquake stress drop to characterize the transition between pressure-constrained and runaway rupture behavior.

The introduction of nanotechnology from the fields of Biology and Material Science to the application in EOR is emerging because nanoparticles have the potential to alter formation factors like wettability and fluid properties like IFT and viscosity. However, a systematic literature review shows that ambiguity exists regarding whether nanoparticles can change wettability and IFT or not and which component in nanofluid plays a role. In this work, we investigated the effects of bare silica nanoparticles on wettability and IFT using a contact angle goniometer. The results showed that the contact angle measurement on quartz plates had relatively large uncertainty while those on calcite plates showed a clear trend that the smaller the nanoparticle size and the larger the nanofluid concentration, the smaller the contact angle. In addition, silica nanoparticles did not have an effect on IFT. Core flooding experiments showed an increase of 8.7% in oil recovery factor by the use of silica nanoparticles, which support the oil recovery mechanism of wettability alteration. "

                    "abstract": "The rich information contained in permanent downhole gauge (PDG) data has drawn attention from researchers. Previous work has demonstrated feature-based machine learning to be promising for PDG data analysis. The recent rise of deep learning was powered by techniques including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been shown useful for processing sequential information. In this work, we explored how RNN can be utilized to analyze PDG data for better reservoir characterization and modeling, by examining two specific RNN structures: nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) and standard RNN. RNN is a special type of artificial neural network designed for sequential data processing. Unlike a nonrecurrent neural network, the hidden layers in RNN take memories of previous computations (e.g. hidden layers or outputs computed in previous time) into account. In that way, the information contained in the measurements prior to a certain time can be used to model the response at that time, i.e. the convolutional effects are modeled by the recurrent structure of the RNN. Another favorable property of RNN is that it requires no assumptions on physics in advance. Both the inputs and outputs come directly from the raw measurements, and no handcrafted features need to be extracted from the forward physics model. Compared with feature-based machine learning, RNN is more powerful for the modeling where the forward model has not been determined. In this work, RNN was first tested on a series of synthetic and real flow rate-pressure datasets. The patterns learned by RNN from those data helped correctly identify the reservoir model and forecast the reservoir performance. RNN was also applied on temperature transient data, to demonstrate its advantage over feature-based machine learning with no assumptions on the physics model. The study also showed that RNN has the noise tolerance and computational efficiency that make it a promising candidate to analyze PDG data in practice. "

To resolve the issue in the face of geologically variation, we need to understand how the production is influenced by the injection, in other words, the connectivity between the producers and injectors. It would be very useful for us to build a reservoir scale network based on the connectivity and perform reservoir analysis using such a network representation, without reference to a reservoir simulation model that is obliged to make assumptions about the geology. The work shown in this paper was organized into three parts. First, a modified Pearson's correlation coefficient was proposed as a new connectivity definition based on the correlation between injection and production histories. Next, machine learning based multiwell testing was applied to learn the correlation between producer rate features and injector pressures, which provided a validation to the connectivity estimated by modified Pearson's correlation coefficient. Last, a connectivity based network was proposed as an abstract reservoir representation. A series of network analyses can be performed on the established network, e.g. reservoir compartmentalization by detecting the strongly connected clusters in the network. The proposed methodologies were applied on both synthetic and real data sets. The connectivity was shown to be able to capture the injectors' influence on producers, and was verified by comparing with the true reservoir model and results from tracer tests. The target injectors with high influence on production were identified easily as the ones connected to multiple producers, information that can be used to guide a better waterflooding operation. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well-stimulation technique. Recently, the application of multiple hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells has made possible the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas and shale oil. However, the process of horizontal-well fracturing is uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. There exist many questions about the number and position of created fractures and whether the fracture stays contained within the main reservoir thickness. This work presents the modeling and analysis of temperature data during and after the creation of multiple fractures along a horizontal well. Our model accounts for fracture growth and closure, the well effects, and interaction between multiple fractures. The interference between multiple fractures growing simultaneously and the presence of reservoir-permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Capabilities and limitations of information carried by temperature data are presented through different geometry analyses. A special consideration of fracture growth out of zone was addressed. For this case, it was considered that one of the hydraulic fractures activates a pre-existing fault and interconnects the reservoir with other zones hundreds of feet away. Our work shows the advantage of the use of continuous-distributed-temperature data in comparison with the traditional single-point-pressure analysis. The local characteristic of temperature allows us to identify not only which of the created hydraulic fractures has interconnected the main reservoir with a different zone, but also the location of this zone. We also account for the effect of the interconnection on the growth of the other hydraulic fractures along the horizontal wellbore. The simultaneous multiple fracture growth shows that falloff-distributed-temperature data can predict the number of created fractures. More than that, in the presence of heterogeneity, the interaction between the contained fractures can be captured by the temperature analysis. Different from the pressure analysis, distributed-temperature data can differentiate between heterogeneity locations along the wellbore. Throughout this study, we present a series of examples in which the temperature can provide information that would not be obtained from the traditional pressure analysis. "

                    "abstract": "In unconventional hydrocarbon resources, determining appropriate infill spacing for horizontal wells is a difficult reservoir-engineering task that can have major economic implications. Infill-well spacing should be dense enough to maximize contact with the reservoir, but the wells should not overlap into regions that were depleted previously. Similarly, refracturing operations depend heavily on the reservoir response during production. Techniques must be developed that one can apply in the field to identify the extent of the depleted zones near production wells. Microseismic depletion delineation (MDD) was proposed as one such reservoir-surveillance technique. MDD takes advantage of a poroelastic-stress change that occurs as a result of reservoir depletion. After a significant period of production, fluid is reinjected into the well at low rates for a short duration to cause pressure to rise in the network of fractures connected to the well. One can determine appropriate injection pressures to ensure that fractures that fail in shear during reinjection must exist within the depleted region. One could infer the shape and the extent of the depleted zone by monitoring for microseismic activity during the injection test. In this study, we used numerical modeling to investigate the physical mechanisms that underpin the MDD technique. We first modeled a multistage hydraulic-fracture treatment of a horizontal well in a naturally fractured reservoir. After the stimulation treatment, we modeled 1 year of production to cause pressure drawdown and an associated poroelastic response. The field test was then modeled by reinjecting water into the well at low rates and pressures for a short time. Shear-slip events on fractures that occurred during reinjection were considered proxies for microseismic events. The heterogeneous distribution of pressure drawdown was demarcated clearly with the locations of the microseismic events. The results indicate that one could apply MDD in the field as an effective means of reservoir surveillance. One could use the modeling framework that we developed to design field tests and to interpret field data. "

                    "abstract": "Current advances in the well completion technology have allowed for more complex smart well instrumentations with marginal additional cost. As an example, optical fibers can be run along horizontal wells to provide acoustic and temperature data that are distributed both in time and space. With such data at our disposal, an immediate evaluation of the well response is possible as changes in the reservoir or well occur. Most current work in distributed measurements looks at Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) or Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data individually, which limits our inferences about the multiphase flow problem. The objective of this work was to look at the two pieces of data together and determine what improvements can be achieved in multiphase flow problems compared to the conventional methods of looking at each DAS and DTS alone. The study began by evaluating the performance of DAS in analyzing two-phase flow; a process which begins by extracting the speed of sound within the fluid medium from the acoustic signal, then obtaining the phase fraction combination that obtains this speed of sound reading. Another procedure is explained to obtain similar results from DTS measurements. In this case, however, the in-situ phase fractions are correlated to the Joule-Thomson effect as reservoir fluids enters the wellbore. As both these procedures are limited to one- and two-phase flow applications, we extended the solution to work in three-phase flow problems by combining information from DAS and DTS. The flow profiling procedure was applied to two smart wells in the Middle East. Flowrates from different segments of the well were calculated and results were in close agreement with a surface flowmeter for most sections of the well. In cases where both DAS and DTS were not available for the same well, a commercial compositional and thermal reservoir simulator was used to generate synthetic examples. By applying the developed procedure, we found that cointerpretation of DAS and DTS data yields accurate in-situ three-phase fractions for all ranges of water cuts and gas volume fraction. In comparison, analyzing DAS or DTS individually is usually not sufficient to fully determine a three-phase flow problem. "

                    "abstract": "One of the key issues to a successful EGS (Enhanced or engineered Geothermal System) is the creation of a great density of fractures. The detection and characterization of the created fractures is crucial in evaluating the geothermal energy resources in such EGS projects as well as in reservoirs for CO2 sequestration and storage. Methods to evaluate the fractures after stimulations are few, and limited in application. To this end, an approach to detecting and evaluating the fractures using resistivity data measured at different frequencies was developed in this study. The effects of fractures on resistivity measurements at different frequencies have been investigated as a function of water saturation in rocks with different porosity, permeability and lithology. Different rocks (Berea sandstone, and greywacke from The Geysers geothermal reservoir) were used in this study. The permeability of the samples ranged from 0.5 to over 1000\u00a0md for the matrix. The frequency ranged from 100 to 100,000\u00a0Hz. It was found that the effect of frequency on resistivity is different in rocks with and without fractures, especially in the range of low water saturation. The validity of the Archie equation depends on the existence of fractures, the frequency, and the range of water saturation. The relationship between resistivity and water saturation did not follow the Archie equation at low water saturation in some rocks with fractures. Models for characterizing different types of rocks with specific fracture patterns have been established using the resistivity data measured at different frequencies and different water saturations.

A field test called microseismic depletion delineation has previously been proposed as a method to probe the reservoir directly to determine the extent of the depleted region near horizontal wells that have been produced for a significant period of time. In this work, we performed a numerical simulation of a microseismic depletion delineation field test in order to further understand the physical mechanisms that underpin the method. The modeling framework developed herein can be used to help design field tests and interpret field observations. We observed that application of a model that coupled fluid flow, fracture mechanics, poroelasticity, and geologic structure was able to produce the physical behavior necessary to interpret observations from microseismic depletion delineation field tests. 1. INTRODUCTION The successful exploitation of unconventional resources depends on the ability to develop strategic engineering designs using economic considerations as the primary drivers. In shale oil plays, like the Bakken for instance, suitable wellpad geometries and well trajectories are first determined and then repeated many times in an efficient pattern in order to reduce drilling costs. Similarly, hydraulic fracture treatments are commonly performed in repeatable patterns across many wells. This methodology is attractive from an economic standpoint, but given that heterogeneity exists in all reservoirs and that operational difficulties can arise, the approach may not always result in the optimal recovery for a given well. Evidence from field data has indicated that productivity of individual wells, and even individual completion stages, can be highly variable [1, 2]. It is useful to develop tests that can be applied in the field in order to assess the recovery efficiency of wells and individual completion stages within each well. This information can be helpful from a reservoir management perspective, for example, in order to estimate ultimate recovery or to determine appropriate spacing for infill drilling in a given asset.

                    "abstract": "Permanent downhole gauges (PDGs) can provide a continuous record of flow rate and pressure, which provides us rich information about the reservoir and makes PDG data a valuable source for reservoir analysis. In previous work, it has been shown that kernel ridge regression based machine learning is a promising tool to interpret pressure transients from a single PDG. Kernel ridge regression denoises and deconvolves the pressure signal efficiently and recovers the full reservoir behaviors. In this work, the machine learning framework was extended to two applications: multiwell testing and flow rate reconstruction. The multiwell testing was formulated into the machine learning algorithm using a feature-coefficient-target model. The features were nonlinear functions of flow rate histories of all the wells. For each well, the features and the pressure target of this well were used to train its coefficients, which implicitly contain the information about the reservoir model and well interactions. The reservoir model can then be revealed by predicting the pressure corresponding to a simple rate history with the trained model. The multiwell machine learning model was demonstrated to be useful in several different ways, including artificial interference testing and reservoir pressure prediction at various well locations based on flow rate data only. Flow rate reconstruction aims at estimating any missing flow rate history by using available pressure history. This is a very useful capability in practical applications in which individual well rates are not recorded continuously. A set of new features were developed as functions of pressure to model the flow rate. Coupled with kernel ridge regression, the developed features were tested on both synthetic and real data sets and demonstrated high prediction accuracy. The success of the rate reconstruction modeling also illustrates the flexibility of machine learning to different kinds of modeling, by adapting features and targets. The models for both applications maintained the advantages of the machine learning based single well pressure interpretation in terms of the accuracy of prediction, computational efficiency and tolerance to noise. This work further demonstrates machine learning as a promising technique for PDG data analysis. "

                    "abstract": "In many reservoir studies, anisotropic permeability is often ignored or considered to have only simple relationships. Often, permeability anisotropy is modeled only between the vertical and horizontal directions, while permeability values in a horizontal plane are considered equal. In reality, the depositional history of the reservoir results in more complex behavior. Knowledge of the permeability anisotropy has important implications in several types of devlopment scenarios, thus it is important to have accurate estimates of these directional permeability values. For example, a partially-penetrating well that allows for vertical flow at depths below the completed interval requires knowledge of the vertical to horizontal permeability anisotropy. As another example, improved estimates of horizontal permeability anisotropy would have significance for directional drilling design. In this work, the utility of temperature data as a matching parameter was investigated to estimate these directional permeability values. The study utilized a full-physics, thermal reservoir simulator and a nonlinear, least-squares regression algorithm for parameter estimation. By modeling block temperatures near the well, the study attempted to replicate the temperature data gathered from Distributed Temperature Survey (DTS) tools which use fibers to measure temperature history at the well. Using this method, the permeability anisotropy in two scenarios (vertical-horizontal and horizontal-horizontal) was estimated successfully with a high degree of accuracy. Even with the addition of synthetic noise to the temperature signal, the regression was robust in estimating the values successfully in the majority of anisotropy scenarios that were tested. "

                    "abstract": "A significant and unique factor associated with gas-condensate reservoirs is a prominent decrease in productivity once the flowing bottom-hole pressure drops below the dew-point pressure. Gas-condensate reservoirs exhibit complex phase and flow behaviors due to the appearance of a condensate bank in the near-well region, and differ in their behavior from conventional gas reservoirs, especially for low permeability, high-yield systems where the condensate banking is more severe. However, there is still a lack of understanding phase and flow behaviors of gas-condensate reservoirs. The difficulty lies in the variation of the composition of the in-situ fluid due to the accumulation of heavy components in the condensate phase. A good understanding of how the gas condensate reservoirs vary in composition is very important to optimize the producing strategy, to reduce the impact of condensate banking, and to improve the ultimate gas recovery. The composition variation has been observed in the field but its effects have been reported rarely in the literature. This work studied compositional variation of gas-condensate systems through a series of laboratory experiments and supporting numerical simulations. The study verified claims on the effect of flow through porous media on the apparent behavior of a gas-condensate mixture. These include compositional variation during depletion, failure to achieve condensate revaporization upon well shut-in, and the effect of well bottom-hole pressures on condensate banking. The effect of irreducible water saturation on the composition variation was also studied. Results from this study show that composition can vary significantly during depletion. Due to the difference in mobilities and accumulation effect, the composition of the mixture will change locally. The overall composition near the wellbore becomes richer in heavy components. As a result, the phase envelope of fluid will shift. Near-well fluids can undergo a transition from retrograde gas to volatile oil. By taking account of the new understanding of the impact of compositional changes, the liquid dropout can be \"controlled\" by the production strategy. Also, some common practices, for example shutting wells after condensate drops out to revaporize the condensate can be understood to be ineffective. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional parameter estimation methods used in pressure transient analysis assume specific analytical probability distributions of error and use corresponding likelihood functions to estimate the key parameters such as reservoir permeability, wellbore storage, skin and distance to reservoir boundary. The most commonly used method is that of least squares, which assumes that measurement errors follow a Gaussian distribution. Lack of a priori information regarding the nature of these measurement errors have made the ordinary least squares method (OLS) the most common method for parameter estimation. In this study, on examination of multiple field data sets, the assumption of Gaussian errors was found to be weak. The use of OLS in such cases leads to biased estimates of reservoir parameters. A general method based on the framework of likelihood maximization that is inherent to parameter estimation was developed. This method does not require a prior assumption regarding the nature of the distribution of the underlying errors in the data. A hybrid variation was developed to improve the convergence properties of this method. The accuracy and convergence properties of this method were compared to that of OLS for field and synthetic datasets and found to be superior to OLS for arbitrary error distributions, while still maintaining accuracy in cases with truly Gaussian errors.

                    "abstract": "Permanent downhole gauges (PDGs) provide a continuous record of pressure, temperature, and sometimes flow rate during well production. The continuous record provides us rich information about the reservoir and makes PDG data a valuable source for reservoir analysis. It has been shown in previous work that the convolution kernel based data mining approach is a promising tool to interpret flow rate and pressure data from PDGs. The convolution kernel method denoises and deconvolves the pressure signal successfully without explicit breakpoint detection. However, the bottlenecks of computational efficiency and incomplete recovery of reservoir behaviors limit the application of the method to interpret real PDG data. In this paper, three different machine learning techniques were applied to flow rate - pressure interpretation. We formulated the problem into a linear regression on parameters that connect the nonlinear flow rate features with pressure targets. The linear process leads to a closed form solution, which speeds up the computation dramatically. Linear regression was shown to have the same learning quality as the convolution kernel method, and outperforms it with much less computational effort. Kernel ridge regression was applied to address the issue of incomplete recovery of reservoir behaviors. Kernel ridge regression utilizes the expanded features given by the kernel function to capture the more detailed reservoir behaviors, while controlling the prediction error using ridge regression. It was shown that kernel ridge regression recovers the full reservoir behaviors successfully, e.g. wellbore storage effect, skin effect, infinite-acting radial flow and boundary effect. Some potential uses of temperature data from PDGs are also discussed in this paper. Machine learning was shown to be able to model temperature and pressure data recorded by PDGs, even if the actual physical model is complex. This originates from the fact that by using features as an approximation, machine learning does not require perfect knowledge of the physical model. The modeling of pressure using temperature data was extended to two promising applications: pressure history reconstruction using temperature data, and the cointerpretation of temperature and pressure data when flow rate data are not available.

If the temperature distributions could be measured more precisely, this would greatly enhance the ability to estimate other reservoir properties, which would in turn inform reservoir engineering and field management decisions. Work toward two distinct but parallel objectives are described here. The first is to rank the informativity of various tracer candidates using modeling. The second is to develop temperature sensitive tracers experimentally, such that they would be capable of characterizing fracture properties and temperature distribution. The design of temperature-sensitive tracers is built around the design of the temperature sensing mechanism. In other words, the mechanism by which temperature is measured and the form and resolution of the resulting data, or response, have a profound impact on how informative that tracer can be about thermal breakthrough. Therefore, it is important to model the responses of candidate tracers in the context of an inverse problem to determine their relative informativity. In order to quantify tracer informativity for the simplified case in which the reservoir consists of a single parallel-plate fracture, one-dimensional analytical models were used to calculate the responses of four tracer types: conservative solute tracer, dye-releasing nanotracer, threshold nanoreactor, and temperature\u2013time tracer (TTT). Inverse modeling was performed for various scenarios, and thermal breakthrough curves were calculated for each solution found. Tracers investigated in this study were found to perform very well, with small ranges of uncertainty for both thermal breakthrough forecasting and fracture property estimation. This was because the problem was highly constrained by defining the reservoir as a single fracture. For more realistic reservoir models consisting of complex fracture networks, it is expected that the uncertainty ranges would be larger and that all three temperature-sensitive tracers investigated here will outperform conservative solute tracers because their responses contain information about the temperature distribution. Experiments were performed to evaluate several potential nanosensor candidates for their temperature-sensitivity and to investigate particle mobility through porous and fractured media. Temperature-sensitive particles investigated in this study include the irreversible thermochromic, dye-attached silica and silica-protected DNA particles. A combined heat and flow test confirmed the temperature-sensitivity of the irreversible thermochromic particles by observing the color change. A detectable change in the fluorescent emission spectrum of the dye-attached silica particles upon heating was observed. The processing and detection of silica-encapsulated DNA particles with hydrofluoric acid chemistry was tested. A protocol to release the DNA by dissolving the silica layer without completely destroying the DNA was established. The silica-encapsulated DNA particles were flowed through a porous medium at high temperature. Some dissolution of silica particles was observed, leading to a reduction in their size. This research showed that synthesizing particles to respond to a specific reservoir property such as temperature is feasible. Using particles to measure reservoir properties is advantageous because particles can be transported to areas in the reservoir that would not be accessible by other means and therefore provide measurements deep within the formation.

These observations are apparently contradictory because (1) is consistent with shear stimulation, but (2) and (3) suggest propagation of new fractures. To reconcile these observations, we propose that, in many cases, new fractures do not form at the wellbore, but away from the wellbore, and new fractures initiate from open and/or sliding natural fractures and propagate through the formation. Fracture initiation from natural fractures is aided by concentrations of stress caused by the fractures\u05f3 opening and sliding. The propagating fractures may terminate against natural fractures, forming a complex network of both new and preexisting fractures. We perform computational modeling with a discrete fracture network simulator that couples fluid flow with the stresses induced by fracture deformation. The modeling results demonstrate that several geological conditions must be in place for stimulation to occur only through induced slip on preexisting fractures and to avoid significant opening of new or preexisting fractures. These conditions cannot be expected to be present at every EGS project, and our review of the literature shows that they typically are not. The simulation results indicate that pure shear stimulation is more likely to be possible in locations with thick faults present, and our review of the literature shows that EGS field experience is consistent with this hypothesis. We discuss field experiences from several EGS projects and describe how they are consistent with the idea that significant propagation of new fractures has occurred. "

                    "abstract": "Shale gas and liquid-rich shales have become important energy sources in the US and other parts of the world. Shale rocks contain a very heterogeneous pore system. The pore size varies between micro-, meso- and macroscales. One critical phenomenon that governs the flow of hydrocarbons and is strongly affected by pore size is the adsorptive behavior. The adsorbate packing and density is influenced strongly by the force fields of the closely opposing pore walls. In this study, molecular simulation was applied to generate adsorption isotherms of pure methane, pure n-butane and methane/n-butane mixtures using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) techniques. The simulations were conducted on a slit pore model composed of parallel planar graphitic surfaces. Various pore sizes were studied ranging from 1 nm to 20 nm. The nonbonded interactions between the molecules, as well as between the molecules and the pore walls were described with Lennard-Jones potentials. To verify the model, the simulated adsorption isotherms were compared with adsorption isotherms obtained from published experimental data where the adsorption measurements of methane and n-butane were conducted on a Marcellus shale sample and carbon materials; respectively. In the pure molecule cases, results indicate that as the pore width increases, the density of the adsorbed molecules decreases due to the reduction of the fluid-wall interaction. For example, above 10 nm pore-width, the density of methane inside the slit pore becomes comparable to the methane density in the bulk. In the methane/n-butane mixture case, results indicate that the selectivity of n-butane over methane was greater than 1 at low pressures (~200 psi). Therefore, n-Butane is the more favorable component to adsorb and form a layer near the pore walls. However, at high pressures (~1,000 psi), \u201cselectivity reversal\u201d was observed due to size entropy effects. Preferential adsorption leads to compositional variations in the gas produced from the shale. This study provides insights on the adsorptive behavior of light and heavy hydrocarbon molecules. Determining the effect of fluid confinement on adsorption will lead to better understanding of the fluid behavior in rocks with nanoscale pores such as shales. This is especially important when the compositional behavior of confined multicomponent gas-condensate mixtures is investigated during depletion to develop strategies for more effective hydrocarbon recovery. Introduction Hydrocarbon production from liquid-rich shales has been steadily increasing in the US. The principle driver behind the increased production is high oil prices. Shale plays containing oil windows or gas-condensate windows have been very active lately, while development and drilling in the dry gas shale continue to remain flat. Examples of those \u201cliquid-rich\u201d shale plays include the Eagle Ford, Barnett and Marcellus. "

                    "abstract": "As many fields around the world are reaching maturity, several drilling and completion technologies have been developed to boost production from these fields. Smart completions and distributed measurements are two of the most important tools in this category. This study examined a new smart completion tool, Distributed Acoustic Sensor (DAS) in terms of its utility for inflow monitoring and optimization in smart wells. We began by evaluating the performance of DAS as a tool for measuring downhole multiphase flowrate. A description of the methodology to calculate individual phase flowrates from acoustic signals, caused by pressure fluctuations in the flow, is presented. As DAS provides continuous flow of data from the wellbore, another opportunity emerges to optimize the flow from these smart wells. A methodology to use calculated downhole flowrates to update existing simulation models and perform, near real-time optimization is suggested for wells installed with DAS. As opposed to conventional optimization methods that rely only on reservoir simulation models, this procedure also makes use of real-time flow measurements. The methodology was tested on a synthetic model with encouraging results, where the optimum solutions obtained were in close agreement to the true optimum. The flow profiling procedure was applied to several actual wells. The first well was a single-phase oil producer. This process yielded speed of sound results that matched the fluid properties obtained in the lab. Flowrates from different segments of the well were calculated and results were in close agreement with a surface flowmeter for most sections of the well. More examples were conducted in two-phase flow wells with results being more qualitative and less conclusive. When the optimization procedure was applied for synthetic cases that have wells with similar completions to the tested ones, results showed that significant value could be realized by incorporating real-time measurements in the optimization process. Several advantages could be realized with the application of these methods. First, continuous downhole flow monitoring provides asset managers with more accurate allocation of their wells. Second, more accurate modeling for wellbore flow is possible by using in-situ phase flows to calibrate existing models. With more accurate models, evaluating different flow scenarios is possible before applying them on the field. Finally, quick decisions to change the controls of the well are easier with the described optimization method. By comparison, full reservoir simulation model optimization takes a very long time to make their use practical in everyday applications. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well stimulation technique. Recently the application of multiple hydraulic fractures along horizontal wells has made possible the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs, such as shale gas and shale oil. However, the process of horizontal well fracturing is uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. There exist many questions about the number and position of created fractures and whether or not the fracture stays contained within the main reservoir thickness. This work presents the modeling and analysis of temperature data during and after the creation of multiple fractures along a horizontal well. Our model accounts for fracture growth and closure, the well effects and interaction between multiple fractures. The interference between multiple fractures growing simultaneously and the presence of reservoir permeability heterogeneity were investigated. Capabilities and limitations of information carried by temperature data are presented through different geometry analyses. A special consideration of fracture growth out of zone was addressed. For this case it was considered that one of the hydraulic fractures activates a preexisting fault and interconnects the reservoir with other zones hundreds of feet away. Our work shows the advantage of using continuous distributed temperature data in comparison with the traditional single-point pressure analysis. The local characteristic of temperature allows us to identify not only which of the created hydraulic fractures has interconnected the main reservoir with a different zone, but also the location of this zone. We also account for the effect of the interconnection on the growth of the other hydraulic fractures along the horizontal wellbore. The simultaneous multiple fracture growth shows that falloff distributed temperature data can predict the number of created fractures. More than that, in presence of heterogeneity the interaction between the contained fractures can be captured by the temperature analysis. Different from the pressure analysis, distributed temperature data can differentiate between different heterogeneity locations along the wellbore. Throughout this paper we present a series of examples where the temperature can provide information that would not be obtained from the traditional pressure analysis. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing is a complex mathematical problem that involves the mechanical interaction of the propagating fracture with the fluid dynamics of the injected fluid (Gidley et al., 1989). The modeling of the hydraulic fracturing process involves the coupling of at least three processes: the mechanical deformation induced by the fluid pressure on the fracture surfaces; the flow of fluid within the fracture; and the fracture propagation. Usually, the solid (rock) deformation is modeled using the theory of linear elasticity, which is represented by an integral equation that determines the nonlocal relationship between the fracture width and the fluid pressure (Economides and Nolte, 2000; Howard and Fast, 1970). Multifracture treatments have proven to be an effective method for developing oil and gas especially in unconventional reservoirs. Although the use of horizontal multifractured wells is extensive, the process of horizontal well fracturing remains uncertain and it is not fully understood yet. In most cases, hydraulic fracturing field operations in horizontal wells are performed by dividing the well length in many intervals (or stages) and fracturing them sequentially from toe towards the heel. In cased and cemented formations the operation starts by perforating the first stage of interest. Following the perforation of the interval, high rate fluid injection and fracture creation starts. When a stage injection period is over, a plug is set to isolate that interval, and the adjacent one is then perforated and the fracturing fluid injection starts again. This process goes on from the toe to the heel until the scheduled sequence is completed. Another approach is the use of open-hole packers with fracture sleeves (Holley et al., 2012). "

At each project, fractures in the formation were well-oriented to slip at the injection pressures used during stimulation. In all but one case, thousands of cubic meters of water were injected, and in every case, flow rates on the order of tens of liters per second were used. Despite these similarities, there was a large variation in the severity of induced seismicity that occurred in response to injection. At the three projects where induced seismicity was significant, observations at the wellbore showed evidence of well-developed brittle fault zones. At the three projects where induced seismicity was less significant, observations at the wellbore indicated only crack-like features and did not suggest significant fault development. These results suggest that assessments of the degree of fault development at the wellbore may be useful for predicting induced seismicity hazard. We cannot rule out that the differences were caused by variations in frictional properties that were unrelated to the degree of fault development (and it is possible that there is a relationship between these two parameters). The projects with more significant seismicity tended to be deeper, and if this is a meaningful correlation, it is unclear whether depth influenced seismic hazard through the degree of fault development, frictional properties, or some other variable. The results of this paper are not conclusive, but they suggest that there may be significant opportunity for future research on identifying geological conditions that increase induced seismicity hazard.

                    "abstract": "The goal of this research was to develop methods for acquiring reservoir temperature data within the formation and to correlate such information to fracture connectivity and geometry. Existing reservoir-characterization tools allow temperature to be measured only at the wellbore. Temperature-sensitive nanosensors would enable in-situ measurements within the reservoir. Such detailed temperature information enhances the ability to infer reservoir and fracture properties and inform reservoir engineering decisions. This study provides the details of the experimental work performed in the process of developing temperature nanosensors. Specifically, particle mobility through fractured media was investigated. The transport of silica particles through fractured rock was investigated. Experimental results showed that the recovery of the particles was dependent on the particle size and suspension concentration. It was observed that the recovery of the 2 \u00b5m particles following their injection into fractured greywacke core was affected adversely by suspension concentrations (decreasing recovery with increasing suspension concentration). Increasing concentration of the 2 \u00b5m particles resulted in more pronounced aggregation, which led to trapping by straining. Conversely, the recovery of the 5 \u00b5m and polysize particles increased with increasing suspension concentration. The particle size has a direct effect on its recovery. By comparison, the recovery of 5 \u00b5m particles was about an order of magnitude higher than that of the large particles (> 5 \u00b5m). The controlling mechanisms for transport of silica particles were also identified. Among all, transport by gravitational sedimentation (gravity settling) was prominent. Results also showed that the existence of the fracture facilitated the particle transport. Particles were found to flow with the fast-moving streamlines within the fracture. The dominance of particle transport by advection or diffusion was examined using the Peclet number. The high Peclet numbers indicated advection-dominated transport. "

                    "abstract": "Production from the gas-condensate window of the liquid-rich shale plays in the US such as Barnett, Marcellus and Eagle Ford, has increased during the past few years. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the flow behavior of gas-condensate in liquid-rich shales when the flowing bottom-hole pressure falls below the dew-point pressure. Condensate dropout below the dew point pressure leads to variation in the composition of vapor and liquid hydrocarbons. The phase behavior prediction is further complicated by the nanometer-sized pores of the shale formations where fluid-rock interaction could be significant. This work investigated the compositional variation of gas-condensate during flow through Marcellus shale and Berea sandstone in laboratory coreflooding experiments. During the experiments, a gas-condensate mixture was injected into the core and during the flow, gas samples were collected through ports spaced along the core holder. Then, the gas samples were characterized using gas chromatography for compositional analysis. The gas-condensate mixture used in the coreflooding experiment was collected from the Marcellus liquid-rich region and the experiments were conducted at reservoir pressure and temperature. Prior to conducting the experiments, the permeability of the Marcellus shale core and the Berea sandstone core were characterized using the pressure pulse decay technique and the Darcy flow technique; respectively. Results from this study showed that the gas composition varies along the direction of flow during depletion. The change in gas composition is due to the combination of condensate dropout and relative permeability effects. However, the magnitude of variation in the gas composition across the Marcellus shale core was less than that across the Berea sandstone core. This is an indication that the amount of condensate dropout varies between shale and sandstone for the same fluid system and at similar flowing conditions. Hence, the phase behavior is affected by the additional fluid-rock interaction expected for the shale due to fluid flow through nanometer-size pores. "

The optimization approach suggested here is based on maximizing the net present value (NPV) of production revenue from the reservoir. The method relies on tracer and flow-rate data, which are used to calibrate a thermal transport model in such a way that the thermal drawdown depends on the injection rates. Then, an empirical correlation is used to relate the injection and production temperature to the specific electrical power output. The power output model, in conjunction with predictions for the future energy prices and interest rates, allows the computation of the NPV as a function of the injection rates. This characterization of the problem makes it possible to solve it quickly and efficiently. The optimization method was applied to two discrete-fracture reservoir simulation models. The first having a relatively simple structure with two injectors and two producers and the second being a more complex model with seven wells and a fracture structure based on observations from the Soultz-sous-For\u00eats enhanced geothermal system (EGS) in France. The results show that the method works well for both the simple and more complex case. A finding of particular interest is that the optimal injection schedule depends strongly on the minimum design temperature for the power plant. "

The convolution kernel was initially invented and applied in the domain of natural language machine learning. In the original linguistic study, the convolution kernel detected the relationship between words by decomposing words into parts, and evaluating the parts using a simple kernel function. The success of the convolution kernel method inspired us to apply it to data from permanent downhole gauges (PDG). In this study, the data mining process was conducted in two stages, namely learning and prediction processes. In the learning process, the PDG data that were decomposed into a series of pressure responses to the previous flow rate change events were used to train the convolution-kernel-based data mining algorithm until the convergence. After convergence, the reservoir model was obtained implicitly in the form of polynomials in the high-dimensional Hilbert space defined by the convolution kernel function. In the prediction process, a pressure prediction was made by the reservoir model (obtained in the learning process) to an arbitrary given flow rate history (usually a constant flow rate history for simplicity). This flow rate history and the corresponding pressure prediction revealed the reservoir model underlying the variable PDG data. In the previous work, a series of synthetic cases and real field cases have been used to test this approach. The method recovered the reservoir model successfully in all cases. In this paper, the method was tested under problematic data situations, including the existence of significant outliers and aberrant segments, incomplete production history, and unknown initial pressure. The results suggested that: 1) the method tolerated a moderate level of outliers and aberrant segments without any preprocessing; 2) the method could reveal the reservoir model with effective rate correction when the production history was incomplete; 3) the method could reveal the reservoir model and discover the appropriate initial pressure by using an optimization on initial pressure value when the initial pressure was unknown.

                    "abstract": "Recent developments in bottomhole data acquisition techniques, such as distributed temperature sensing systems (DTS), have brought attention to the potential increase of information that can be obtained from temperature data. Studies have shown the application of temperature surveys to estimate flowrate profiles, resolve the kind of damage around the well, improve the robustness of the history matching, among others. Nonetheless, Temperature Transient Analysis (TTA) is not a mature technique and its capabilities have not been explored fully yet. In order to investigate the application of temperature analysis to the hydraulic fracturing problem, in addition to pressure analysis, a numerical model was developed to calculate pressure and temperature responses. Regarding the fracture and reservoir fluid flow, a general approach can be adopted, where the formation permeability and fracture characteristics dictate how the fluids flow during and after fracture growth. We developed a comprehensive model, which accounts for the pressure effect on the temperature response, as well as a dynamic fracture that grows and eventually is allowed to close during falloff. In this research we analyzed the temperature and pressure responses during and immediately after hydraulic fracturing in order to improve our knowledge of this complicated physical problem. Based on this study, we can better understand not only the fracture properties, but also the reservoir itself. In addition, sensitivity analysis shows how reservoir permeability can impact final fracturing performance, as well as pressure and temperature responses. The developed model is also applied to simulate minifrac analysis, and a field example is presented that shows a good agreement with the simulated behavior during fracture closure.

The method recovered the reservoir model successfully in all cases. 1. Introduction The Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDG) is a promising resource for real time downhole measurement. However, a bottleneck in utilizing the PDG data is that the commonly applied well test methods are limited (practically) to short sections of shut-in data only and thus fail to utilize the long term PDG data. Recent technology developments have provided the ability for PDGs to measure both flow rate and pressure, so the limitation of using only shut-in periods could be avoided, theoretically.\u00a0 In practice however it is still difficult to make use of the combined flow rate and pressure data over a PDG record of long duration, due to the noise in both of the signals as well as uncertainty with respect to the appropriate reservoir model over such a long period. Nowadays, a common pressure/flowrate cointerpretation method is deconvolution. Deconvolution is the process that uses the pressure transient response to flow rate to compute the corresponding constant flow rate response. Deconvolution has been discussed for decades, with most approaches being analytical. For example, Ramey (1970) applied Laplace transform on the pressure diffusion equation to solve the partial differential equation in the Laplace space. However, applying the deconvolution to the numerical measurement from PDGs was not practical until a series of important work had been done by von Schroeter et al. (2004). The difficulty is that the deconvolution process is actually a \"desmoothing?? process (Horne, 2007), because the forward convolution equation is a smoothing function. This \"desmoothing?? process brings in serious instability issue in the mathematical solution, especially when the data are noisy. "

                    "abstract": "The permanent downhole gauge (PDG) is a promising tool for reservoir testing but has yet to reach its full potential. Generally, conventional well-testing methods are most able to use small sections of constant-flow-rate data. However, data mining, a newly developed technique in computer science, is a tool that can reveal the relationship among variables from large volumes of data. The application of data-mining algorithms to synthetic and field data has been successful in extracting the reservoir model from variable-flow-rate and pressure-transient data. In fact, because of uncertainty in flow-rate measurements, this technique is one of the few ways to make use of the flow-rate data that are now available with some modern PDG tools. The application is conducted in two steps. First, the pressure and flow-rate data from the PDG are used to train a nonparametric data-mining algorithm. The reservoir model is obtained implicitly in the form of polynomials in a high-dimensional Hilbert space defined by kernel functions when the algorithm converges after being trained to the data. Next, a specific flow-rate input (for example, constant rate) is fed into the data-mining algorithm. The datamining algorithm will make a pressure prediction subject to the input flow rate. Because the data-mining algorithm has already obtained the reservoir model, the pressure prediction is expected to be the reservoir response given the constant flow rate. Therefore, the proposed constant flow rate and the predicted pressure reveal the reservoir model underlying the variable PDG data, without needing to specify in advance which reservoir model is to be used. Three methods (Methods A, B, and C), differing by input vectors, kernel functions, and presence of breakpoints detection, are proposed in the paper. Synthetic noisy data and real field data were used to test this approach. Methods B and C were able to satisfactorily recover the wellbore/reservoir model in most considered cases. Even in extreme cases when the flow-rate data are noisy and changing frequently, and in the absence of any shut-ins, the method was still able to extract the reservoir models. "

Existing reservoir-characterization tools allow pressure and temperature to be measured only at the wellbore. The development of temperature- and pressure-sensitive nanosensors will enable in-situ measurements within the reservoir. This paper provides the details of the experimental work performed in the process of developing temperature nanosensors. The study investigated the parameters involved in the mobility of nanoparticles through porous and fractured media. These parameters include particle size or size distribution, shape, and surface charge or affinity to rock materials. The principal findings of this study were that spherically shaped nanoparticles of a certain size and surface charge compatible with that expected in formation rock are most likely to be transported successfully, without being trapped because of physical straining, chemical, or electrostatic effects. We found that tin-bismuth (Sn-Bi) nanoparticles of 200 nm and smaller were transported through Berea sandstone. Larger particles were trapped at the inlet of the core, indicating that there was an optimum particle size range. We also found that the entrapment of silver (Ag) nanowires was primarily because of their shape. This conclusion was supported by the recovery of the spherical Ag nanoparticles with the same surface characteristics through the same porous media used during the Ag nanowires injection. The entrapment of hematite nanorice was attributed to its affinity to the porous matrix caused by surface charge. The hematite coated with surfactant (which modified its surface charge to one compatible with flow media) flowed through the glass beads, emphasizing the importance of particle surface charge. Preliminary investigation of the flow mechanism of nanoparticles through a naturally fractured greywacke core was conducted by injecting fluorescent silica microspheres. We found that silica microspheres of different sizes (smaller than the fracture opening) could be transported through the fracture. We demonstrated the possibility of using microspheres to estimate fracture aperture by injecting a polydisperse microsphere sample. It was observed that only spheres of 20 \u00b5m and smaller were transported. This result agreed reasonably well with the measurement of hydraulic fracture aperture (27 \u00b5m), as determined by the cubic law. "

Although the Newton type of algorithm gives faster convergence than most other gradient-based inverse solution algorithms, its use is limited to small- and medium-scale problems in which the sensitivity coefficients are easily and quickly computed. Modelers often use less-efficient algorithms (e.g., conjugate-gradient and quasi-Newton) to model large-scale problems because these algorithms avoid the direct computation of sensitivity coefficients. To find a direction of descent, such algorithms often use less-precise curvature information that would be contained in the gradient of the objective function. Using a sensitivity matrix gives more-complete information about the curvature of the function; however, this comes with a significant computational cost for large-scale problems. An improved adjoint-sensitivity computation is presented for time-dependent partial-differential equations describing multiphase flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs. The method combines the wavelet parameterization of data space with adjoint-sensitivity formulation to reduce the cost of computing sensitivities. This reduction in cost is achieved by reducing the size of the linear system of equations that are typically solved to obtain the sensitivities. This cost-saving technique makes solving an inverse problem with algorithms (e.g., Levenberg-Marquardt and Gauss-Newton) viable for large multiphase-flow history-matching problems. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated for two numerical examples involving multiphase flow in a reservoir with several production and injection wells. "

                    "abstract": "Nonlinear regression is a well-established technique in well-test interpretation. However, this widely used technique is vulnerable to issues commonly observed in real data sets--specifically, sensitivity to noise, parameter uncertainty, and dependence on starting guess. In this paper, we show significant improvements in nonlinear regression by using transformations on the parameter space and the data space. Our techniques improve the accuracy of parameter estimation substantially. The techniques also provide faster convergence, reduced sensitivity to starting guesses, automatic noise reduction, and data compression. In the first part of the paper, we show, for the first time, that Cartesian parameter transformations are necessary for correct statistical representation of physical systems (e.g., the reservoir). Using true Cartesian parameters enables nonlinear regression to search for the optimal solution homogeneously on the entire parameter space, which results in faster convergence and increases the probability of convergence for a random starting guess. Nonlinear regression using Cartesian parameters also reveals inherent ambiguities in a data set, which may be left concealed when using existing techniques, leading to incorrect conclusions. We proposed suitable Cartesian transform pairs for common reservoir parameters and used a Monte Carlo technique to verify that the transform pairs generate Cartesian parameters. The second part of the paper discusses nonlinear regression using the wavelet transformation of the data set. The wavelet transformation is a process that can compress and denoise data automatically. We showed that only a few wavelet coefficients are sufficient for an improved performance and direct control of nonlinear regression. By using regression on a reduced wavelet basis rather than the original pressure data points, we achieved improved performance in terms of likelihood of convergence and narrower confidence intervals. The wavelet components in the reduced basis isolate the key contributors to the response and, hence, use only the relevant elements in the pressure-transient signal. We investigated four different wavelet strategies, which differ in the method of choosing a reduced wavelet basis. Combinations of the techniques discussed in this paper were used to analyze 20 data sets to find the technique or combination of techniques that works best with a particular data set. Using the appropriate combination of our techniques provides very robust and novel interpretation techniques, which will allow for reliable estimation of reservoir parameters using nonlinear regression.

                    "abstract": "Current downhole measuring technologies have provided a means of acquiring downhole measurements of pressure, temperature, and sometimes flow-rate data. Jointly interpreting all three measurements provides a way to overcome data limitations that are associated with interpreting only two measurements--pressure and flow-rate data--as is currently done in pressure-transient analysis. This work shows how temperature measurements can be used to improve estimations in situations where lack of sufficient pressure or flow-rate data makes parameter estimation difficult or impossible. The model that describes the temperature distribution in the reservoir lends itself to quasilinear approximations. This makes the model a candidate for Bayesian inversion. The model that describes the pressure distribution for a multirate flow system is also linear and a candidate for Bayesian inversion. These two conditions were exploited in this work to present a way to cointerpret pressure and temperature signals from a reservoir. Specifically, the Bayesian methods were applied to the deconvolution of both pressure and temperature measurements. The deconvolution of the temperature measurements yielded a vector that is linearly related to the average flow-rate from the reservoir and, hence, could be used for flow-rate estimation, especially in situations in which flow-rate measurements are unavailable or unreliable. This flow rate was shown to be sufficient for a first estimation of the pressure kernel in the pressure-deconvolution problem. When the appropriate regularization parameters are chosen, the Bayesian methods can be used to suppress fluctuations and noise in measurements while maintaining sufficient resolution of the estimates. This is the point of the application of the method to data denoising. In addition, because Bayesian statistics represent a state of knowledge, it is easier to incorporate certain information, such as breakpoints, that may help improve the structure of the estimates. The methods also lend themselves to formulations that make possible the estimation of initial properties, such as initial pressures. "

Therefore, a detailed description of oil combustion kinetics is required. The goal of this work is to present and apply a workflow to define and match pseudo-kinetic reaction models based on Arrhenius kinetics. These models are meant to be used at the laboratory scale with high-resolution, fully-resolved simulation models as a tool to generate high density data required by upscaled models at reservoir scale. The workflow starts by performing ramped temperature oxidation (RTO) experiments for a wide range of heating rates. New experimental equipment has allowed us to obtain data for large heating rates (>15\u00b0Cmin ) that were not achievable in the past. A subset of the experiments are selected to match the oxygen consumption curves by tuning kinetic parameters of several global reaction models using pattern search optimization. Those models that obtain a match are validated by predicting a second subset of the data that was not considered during the optimization. The workflow is tested using a heavy oil and two satisfactory matches with two different global reaction models are obtained. "

                    "abstract": "Increasing regulations on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and fluctuations in the price of natural gas are driving innovation for crude-oil production methods. Solar-generated steam has the promise to reduce by up to 80% of GHG emissions in areas of abundant solar insolation. There are cyclic fluctuations in the steam injection rate associated with sunlight hours and seasonal variations that create the risk of temperature and pressure fluctuations along the wellbore. This paper analyzes the recovery efficiency of the steam injection process for solar-generated steam supplemented with conventional steam. The viability of solar thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) was evaluated using data from the San Joaquin Valley in California as input to a commercial reservoir simulator. The efficiency was quantified through reservoir simulation using a layered homogeneous 3D grid and corresponding economic analysis. Reservoir simulations with variable steam rate, quality, and temperature of diurnal and nocturnal steam injection were conducted. Various injection schedules and reservoir responses were analyzed, including the geomechanical response for continuous variable rate injection. The economic analysis was based on the operating expenses, mainly heating, lifting, and maintenance costs per unit of oil extracted. This research shows that reducing the dependency on conventional steam using a minimum nocturnal steam rate contributes to better energy efficiency. Also, reducing the steam quality by up to 50% percent in both diurnal and nocturnal injection presented a promising cost-effective solution despite reducing somewhat the amount of oil recovered. We also discovered that reducing the nocturnal steam temperature provided substantial economic benefits with only a minor impact on the cumulative oil recovered. The geomechanical reservoir deformation triggered by steam pressure and temperature variations was within reasonable limits and did not present causes for concern. This economic analysis was done assuming an already paid out capital expense, both for solar and conventional steam. We compute the Net Present Value (NPV) of the profits using multiple price scenarios to compare the different cases. The maintenance cost and efficiency degradation for the solar generated steam is not considered in the absence of any available long term industry data. An optimal injection schedule and conventional steam contribution can be engineered based on the field operating and economic requirements. "

                    "abstract": "Continuous variable pressure steam injection is a new approach to manage heat flow within a reservoir and reduce the temperature of fluids arriving at producers thereby avoiding shut-in caused by high temperature. An optimal injection scenario with varied pressure and constant steam quality is shown to have the largest oil recovery given the same amount of energy injected under various reservoir settings. The economic effects were evaluated to select the optimal variable pressure injection schedule with the greatest Net Present Value (NPV). Various scenarios with different injection pressures and steam qualities were investigated and compared based upon aspects of oil recovery, energy consumption, and periods of producer shut in. Sensitivity analysis was performed regarding permeability, well distances, heat losses, as well as geomechanical model parameters including Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio, and initial stress. Grid refinement experiments dictated the optimal unit grid dimension for accurate 3D modeling including geological heterogeneity. Reservoir subsidence was also investigated. The variable-pressure injection cycles were designed and evaluated using an economics model. Results teach that the proposed steam injection schedules provide continuous oil production (i.e., no producer shuts in) with the largest energy efficiency and economic benefits. The hybrid injection strategy for a 3-D heterogenous case showed an increase in 15% more oil recovered compared to the constant pressure injection scenario after 10 years of production. We conclude that steam injection design effectively controls the reservoir temperature and avoids producer shut-in. The sensitivity analysis further supports the feasibility of this optimal scenario under various reservoir conditions. Inclusion of geomechanics provides important information about reservoir deformation, but geomechanics has little effect on the oil produced or the optimal injection strategy. Importantly, the subsidence results do not indicate well failure under the conditions studied. By performing a systematic investigation, the combination of continuous high and low constant-pressure steam injection for fixed time intervals yields the largest NPV. "

These data could be used to compare with cutting edge numerical simulations of the dynamics of snap-off for which experimental and numerical data are lacking. Drainage experiments in constricted capillary tubes were performed where a dyed wetting liquid is displaced by air for varying flow rates. We developed an optical method to measure liquid film thicknesses that range from 3 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcm. The optical measures are validated by comparison with both theory and direct numerical simulations. In a constricted capillary tube we observed, both experimentally and numerically, a phenomenon of snap-off coalescence events in the vicinity of the constriction that bring new insights into our understanding and modeling of two-phase flows.

A multi scale approach was adopted where experimental characterization at the core level was linked with a digital laboratory through molecular modeling to simulate and predict pure and multicomponent adsorption conditions that were hard to achieve in the lab. The sensitivity of shale physical properties to the gas mixture saturating the pore space was examined for possible carbon storage and enhanced gas shale recovery applications. A novel high precision volumetric gas adsorption apparatus was constructed in house to investigate multi-component gas sorption at the core level. The thermodynamically closed system allowed for simultaneous measurements of three fundamental rock properties at the core level including porosity, permeability and excess adsorption. Experiments were carried out to measure the preferential adsorption of different components in a gas mixture on intact core samples from the Haynesville and Barnett shale plays. Based on the pore size distribution (PSD) of the sample, the experimental observations were confirmed using a grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation employing a slit pore model composed of parallel planar graphitic surfaces. Experimental results revealed multi-layer adsorption coverage with CO2 in comparison to a mono-layer coverage with N2 and CH4. Mixed gas sorption measurements showed preferential adsorption of CO2 over CH4 as indicated by a selectivity coefficient greater than 1. GCMC simulations on pore sizes ranging from 1\u00a0nm to 50\u00a0nm were consistent with the core-scale experimental results and revealed an increasing selectivity for CO2 over CH4 in model shale pores. N2 injection, however, proved to be an unsuccessful enhanced gas recovery technique due to a preferential adsorption of CH4 over N2. "

Gas-storage (free and sorbed gas) capacity was investigated at the core scale with carbon dioxide (CO2) and krypton (Kr) by use of X-ray computed tomography (CT) with voxel dimensions of 190\u00d7190\u00d71000 \u03bcm. Also, 2D tiled images were acquired with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and stitched together to form 2.54-cm-diameter mosaics with a pixel resolution of 1.5 \u03bcm. Multiscale-image registration was then carried out to align the CT data with the SEM mosaics. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) generated elemental spectra maps and subsequent component maps for regions with either substantial or minimal gas storage to assess the interplay of structural features (e.g., fractures) and matrix composition with respect to gas accessibility and storage. Registration of CT scans (vacuumed and gas-filled) as well as 190-\u03bcm-resolution CT-derived gas-storage maps with 1.5-\u03bcm-resolution SEM mosaics is straight forward for samples with dense features (such as calcite-filled fractures) that are resolvable by CT imaging. Alignment methods were developed for samples lacking these features, including registration marks by use of silver paint and intermediate-resolution microCT scans with cubic voxel dimensions of 27 \u03bcm. After alignment, the relationship of enhanced storage zones with open fractures and reduced storage regions with secondary mineralization (such as nodules) is apparent for the carbonaceous samples. For the clay-rich Barnett sample, fracture-filling calcite is associated with reduced storage similar to the other samples; however, secondary carbonate cementation within the clay matrix aligns with regions with substantial Kr- and CO2-gas storage. In contrast, clay-rich matrix regions lacking secondary carbonate cementation exhibit minimal gas-storage potential. Causes for this unexpected result include reduced gas accessibility and, possibly, low organic-matter content in the clay-rich matrix compared with secondary cemented matrix. These gas-sorption experiments prove the feasibility of dynamic core- to nanometer-scale CT/SEM/EDS image registration to improve sample characterization. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of core-scale CO2-gas storage using multiscale imaging. CT and SEM image registration reveal spatial details regarding gas accessibility and storativity at the core scale. This work also supports the potential of carbon storage in shale formations and guides engineers toward optimal CO2-injection zones for enhanced gas recovery. "

The representation may be either in continuous or tabular form (preferred). The reaction model free approach as applied to ISC is outlined and demonstrated for the first time. Comparison to the predictions of ISC from a conventional simulator is favorable.

                    "abstract": "Doctrines often develop with minimal empirical support. This observation is clear in reservoir engineering for heavy and viscous oils. Our objective is to develop a deeper appreciation of the empirical realities to permit improvement of depletion plans and thereby enable projects that are deemed uneconomic by the application of the misleading doctrines. Accordingly, this paper reviews the evidence for and against three doctrines in current use to develop depletion plans: (i) optimal recovery is obtained using a voidage replacement ratio (VRR) of 1, (ii) the Buckley-Leverett formulation applies uniformly to heavier oils, and (iii) viscous fingering dominates unstable multiphase flows. Of primary importance is the doctrine that optimal waterflood response is obtained for a VRR of 1 both on an instantaneous and cumulative basis. A VRR of 1 is mandated in some regulatory jurisdictions and accepted unconditionally by many large oil companies. In the last decade, however, empirical, laboratory, and simulation investigations have demonstrated that, particularly for heavier oils, periods of VRR < 1 significantly increase the oil recovery and reduce water production. Optimal voidage management increases oil recovery by an amount similar to a variety of EOR techniques at minimal cost. A second doctrine is that the multiphase flows within the reservoir occur via the slipping of phases past each other, as formalized by the Buckley-Leverett formulation. Again, empirical and laboratory evidence demonstrates that in many cases two-phase flow occurs by emulsification of one phase, e.g., injected water disperses as small micron size droplets within a continuous oil phase. Such emulsion flows yield results that contradict current doctrines; e.g., decline curves are not monotonic but have steps associated with the type of emulsion. Likewise, the efficacy of polymer flooding is independent of polymer concentration after it exceeds the minimum value needed to support emulsification of water into the oil. These novel predictions have considerable commercial value. Finally, viscous fingering is often attributed to the instability of flow when the displacing phase (water) has a viscosity smaller than that of the displaced phase (oil). Though elegant mathematical formulations explain such unstable flows under idealized laboratory conditions, the reality is that slow pressure diffusion within heavy oils is the originating factor in channelized reservoir flows because commercial injection rates cause altered porosity distributions that initiate the preferential path flow. The appreciation of the empirical realities permits improvement of commercial depletion planning and enables a greater number of projects. These concepts are applicable in almost all heavy-oil reservoirs; they may also be applicable for lighter oils that possess oil chemistry that is typical of heavier oils, e.g., high acid content. "

                    "title": "Producer Well Temperature Control and Optimal Oil Production During a Steamflood",
                    "abstract": "Steam injection is an important method for recovery from heavy-oil reservoirs. A major issue for steam flood operations is the high temperature at the producer well after steam breakthrough. Surface facilities need to be equipped with procedures to handle hot fluids exiting the well head. Wells are sometimes shut in for safety or other practical reasons because they are too hot. There are multiple parameters that influence producer temperature. The focus of this paper is to study the impact of injected steam quality and pressure using reservoir simulation. We find that a combination of high-quality and high-pressure steam injection conditions, followed by injection of steam at reduced quality and reduced pressure achieves larger cumulative oil recovery and reduces producer operating temperature thereby avoiding shut-in. Steam injection at reduced quality, and at lower temperature and pressure, prolongs the producing time of the field, thereby increasing the cumulative volumes of oil recovered. Injection of low quality steam, however, increases operating costs with larger water consumption for steam (CWE) and a larger water production for disposal or reuse. On the other hand, the greater the steam quality, the greater the energy required (BTU) for steam generation. To investigate such tradeoffs, we used a commercial simulator to model a hypothetical layered reservoir with a steam injector and two producers. A steam of quality 1 at 800 psi is injected initially, followed by injection of a lower quality and/or lower pressure/temperature steam in order to keep the producer well temperature below 450 \u00b0F at all times. Our systematic study of steam pressure or temperature and quality leads to the following observations for the particular reservoir characteristics: (i) Reducing steam pressure and quality led to lower cumulative produced oil volume, with better temperature control at the producer well; (ii) For the same amount of energy injected (in BTU units), higher steam quality produced more oil, but led to elevated temperature at the producers and shutting-in of the wells; and (iii) Steam flood with alternating periods of high- pressure, high-quality injection and periods of lower pressure injection led to continuous oil production with producer temperature control. The hybrid injection schedule consists of a combination of alternating high-quality and high-pressure steam flood, followed by reduced steam quality and reduced pressure. Importantly, larger cumulative oil production with lower cumulative energy and water injection resulted from hybrid injection. We also include geomechanical effects to assess any impact of pressure variations and conclude that the hybrid injection strategy is a promising solution for heat control at producer wells. "

                    "abstract": "Catalyzed in-situ combustion of extra heavy crude-oil was studied. The effects of copper nanoparticles (Cu-NP) on combustion were quantified by measuring crude-oil oxidation kinetics and elucidated by capturing front and fuel deposition behavior. Ramped temperature oxidation experiments, coupled with isoconversional analysis, helped measure reaction kinetics. Improvement in the rate of combustion was seen when the nanoparticles were present at a concentration of 1000\u00a0ppm in the aqueous phase. Chiefly, the apparent activation energy of the high-temperature oxidation region decreased. Cu-NP also serve as a reaction inhibitor of low-temperature oxidation (LTO), which is of interest because LTO reactions increase the viscosity of the virgin oil downstream of the combustion front. As a result of this, the alteration of LTO reactions, and the change in fuel formation, the presence of Cu-NP help maintain a greater front temperature. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that the oxidation behavior of the nanoparticles, namely the change of surface and bulk oxidation state, determines the rate and temperature that low-temperature oxidation and high-temperature oxidation occur for the median particle size distribution. Finally, potentiometric titration of the produced fluids shows that Cu-NP change the type of oil produced and decrease the amount of water created during the process. "

                    "abstract": "Four intact one-inch diameter cores from different shale plays (Barnett, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Permian Basin) were analyzed for their gas storage capacity using a novel multiscale imaging methodology spanning from cm- to nm-scale. Gas storage capacity was investigated at the core-scale with carbon dioxide (CO2) and krypton (Kr) using X-ray computed tomography (CT) with voxel dimensions of 190\u00d7190\u00d71000 \u03bcm. Also, 2D tiled images were acquired using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and stitched together to form one-inch diameter mosaics with a pixel resolution of 1.5 \u03bcm. Multiscale image registration was then carried out to align the CT data with the SEM mosaics. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) generated elemental spectra maps and subsequent component maps for regions with either substantial or minimal gas storage to assess the interplay of structural features (e.g., fractures) and matrix composition with respect to gas accessibility and adsorption. Registration of CT scans (vacuumed and gas-filled) as well as 190 \u00b5m-resolution CT-derived gas storage maps with 1.5 \u00b5m-resolution SEM mosaics is straight forward for samples with dense features (such as calcite-filled fractures) that are resolvable by CT imaging. Alignment methods were developed for samples lacking these features including registration marks using silver paint and intermediate resolution microCT scans with cubic voxel dimensions of 27 \u03bcm. Once aligned, the relationship of enhanced adsorption zones with open fractures and reduced adsorption regions with secondary mineralization (such as nodules) is apparent for the carbonaceous samples. For the clay-rich Barnett sample, fracture-filling calcite is associated with reduced adsorption similar to the other samples; however, secondary carbonate cementation within the clay matrix aligns with regions with substantial Kr and CO2 gas storage. In contrast, clay-rich matrix regions lacking secondary carbonate cementation exhibit minimal gas storage potential. Causes for this unexpected result include reduced gas accessibility and, possibly, low organic matter content in the clay-rich matrix compared to secondary cemented matrix. These gas adsorption experiments prove the feasibility of dynamic core- to nm-scale CT/SEM/EDS image registration to improve sample characterization. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of core-scale CO2 gas adsorption employing multiscale imaging. CT and SEM image registration reveal spatial details regarding gas accessibility and storativity at the core-scale. This work also supports the potential of carbon storage in shale formations as well as guides engineers toward optimal CO2 injection zones for enhanced gas recovery. "

Direct observation of pore-scale hydrate growth patterns at reservoir conditions provides an improved framework for fundamental studies of sediment-hosted gas hydrates. The growth pattern and formation rate are discussed with respect to wetting films, fluid distribution, and PT conditions for CH4 and CO2 hydrate. Hydrates appeared initially on the interface between gas spheres and thin water films coating the grain surface, followed by a continuous hydrate growth throughout the pore space. Redistribution of hydrate was observed over several hours at stable conditions. Furthermore, repeated hydrate formation occurred more rapidly and at higher temperatures than during primary formation. The understanding of pore-scale growth of sedimentary gas hydrate has great value in describing hydrates in a geological setting and toward production of a vast energy resource. It may also be a key feature in CO2 storage schemes. "

                    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the measurement of pore-scale geometrical and topological properties of heterogeneous Middle East carbonates using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis, and mercury porosimetry. Quantitative pore network descriptors including porosity, pore body and throat sizes, coordination number (number of throats per pore), shape factor (pore area to perimeter ratio), aspect ratio (pore body to throat size ratio), and their distributions are determined from SEM-based images of thin sections at multiple resolutions as well as physical core measurements. Image analysis revealed pore bodies in 2D images whereas their connecting throat sizes are derived from mercury intrusion data. To compensate for pore sizes that vary over several orders of magnitude, SEM images are collected at 75\u00d7 and 750\u00d7 with pixel resolutions of 2.63 and 0.077\u00a0\u00b5m, respectively. Mosaics (75X) reveal abundant evidence of textural and structural differences within and between the carbonate samples. SEM pore-size distributions generated by merging data from both 75\u00d7 and 750\u00d7 images incorporate microporous features as small as 0.077\u00a0\u00b5m and macropores as large as 310\u00a0\u00b5m into a single multiscale pore system. A pore-throat classification method was developed relating mercury volume invaded through throats of a given size to the corresponding pore area as derived from SEM data. Four pore-throat classes were identified with unique pore- and throat-size distributions ranging from 0.077 to 310.34\u00a0\u00b5m and 0.007\u201323.703\u00a0\u00b5m, respectively. The average coordination number ranges mostly from 3 to 5, and irregular triangle-shaped cross-sections dominate the carbonate pore system. The pore to throat aspect ratio is generally large (>3), indicating the potential for significant residual oil saturation. These pore system parameters and their distributions provide the basis for future pore network modeling studies and allow for improved understanding of pore structure and network framework and their influence on multiphase transport properties and, accordingly, secondary and enhanced oil recovery efficiency in carbonate reservoirs.

Because the application of micro-PIV in micromodels is not standard, extensive effort is invested into validation of the experimental technique. The micro-PIV measurements are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of single-phase flows, for which the modeling is well established once the detailed pore geometry is specified and therefore serves as a reference. The experimental setup is then used with confidence to investigate the dynamics of immiscible two-phase flow in micromodels that represent natural complex porous media (e.g., sandstone). For unstable immiscible two-phase flow experiments, micro-PIV measurements indicate that the flow is highly oscillatory long before the arrival of the invading interface. The dynamics are accompanied with abrupt changes of velocity magnitude and flow direction, and interfacial jumps. Following the passage of the front, dissipative events, such as eddies within the aqueous phase, are observed in the micro-PIV results. These observations of complex interface dynamics at the pore scale motivate further measurement of multiphase fluid movement at the sub-pore scale and requisite modeling. "

On the other hand, low salinity brine injection is a promising technique for increasing oil recovery from clay-rich sandstones in an economic manner. Clay detachment at low salinity conditions, however, drastically alters fluid flow. In this work, clay-functionalized etched-silicon micromodels are used to visualize directly the mobilization of clay at low salinity conditions in (i) the absence of oil, and (ii) the presence of oil. Study results include clay mobilization and pore plugging in the absence and presence of oil visualized by saturating the clay-functionalized micromodel with high salinity brine followed by injections of reduced salinity brines. Clay detachment and migration was observed in oil-free systems for 4000\u00a0ppm NaCl low salinity injection brine. The extent of fines detachment was quantified to determine the types of clay structures affected. Furthermore, fines migration, flocculation, and re-deposition were visualized directly. The types of structures formed (i.e., pore-plugging, pore-lining, etc.) by the re-deposited clay particles are characterized to determine their impact on formation damage. Clay detachment in the presence of oil was also visualized. Initial conditions analogous to clastic reservoirs were established by allowing the crude oil, brine, and solids to interact (i.e., age). Clay detachment occurred during 4000\u00a0ppm NaCl low salinity oil recovery. Real-time, pore-level visualization revealed significant mechanisms during oil recovery processes and their influence on multiphase flow. Specifically, pore plugging particles in water-filled pores obstructed preferential flow paths and diverted injection fluid to unswept regions thereby increasing oil production. "

                    "abstract": "Recovery processes with a voidage-replacement ratio (VRR) (VRR\u00a0= injected volume/produced volume) of unity rely solely on viscous forces to displace oil, whereas a VRR of zero relies on solution-gas drive. Activating a solution-gas-drive mechanism in combination with waterflooding with periods of VRR less than unity (VRR\u00a0< 1) may be optimal for recovery. Laboratory evidence suggests that recovery for VRR\u00a0< 1 is enhanced by emulsion flow and foamy (i.e., bubbly) crude oil at pressures under bubblepoint for some crude oils. This paper investigates the effect of VRR for two crude oils referred to as A1 (88 cp and 6.2 wt% asphaltene) and A2 (600 cp and 2.5 wt% asphaltene) in a sandpack system (18-in. length and 2-in. diameter). The crude oils are characterized with viscosity, asphaltene fraction, and acid/base numbers. A high-pressure experimental sandpack system (1 darcy and Swi\u00a0= 0) was used to conduct experiments with VRRs of 1.0, 0.7, and 0 for both oils. During waterflood experiments, we controlled and monitored the rate of fluid injection and production to obtain well-characterized VRR. On the basis of the production ratio of fluids, the gas/oil and /water relative permeabilities were estimated under two-phase-flow conditions. For a VRR of zero, the gas relative permeability of both oils exhibited extremely low values (10\u20136\u201310\u20134) caused by internal gas drive. Waterfloods with VRR\u00a0< 1 displayed encouraging recovery results. In particular, the final oil recovery with VRR\u00a0= 0.7 [66.2% original oil in place (OOIP)] is more than 15% greater than that with VRR\u00a0= 1 (55.6% OOIP) with A1 crude oil. Recovery for A2 with VRR\u00a0= 0.7 (60.5% OOIP) was identical to the sum of oil recovery for solution-gas drive (19.1% OOIP) plus waterflooding (40.1% OOIP). An in-line viewing cell permitted inspection of produced fluid morphology. For A1 and VRR\u00a0= 0.7, produced oil was emulsified, and gas was dispersed as bubbles, as expected for a foamy oil. For A2 and VRR\u00a0< 1, foamy oil was not clearly observed in the viewing cell. In all cases, the water cut of VRR\u00a0= 1 is clearly greater than that of VRR\u00a0= 0.7. Finally, three-phase relative permeability was explored on the basis of the experimentally determined two-phase oil/water and liquid/gas relative permeability curves. Well-known algorithms for three-phase relative permeability, however, did not result in good history matches to the experimental data. Numerical simulations matched the experimental recovery vs. production time acceptably after modification of the measured krg and krow relationships. A concave shape for oil relative permeability that is suggestive of emulsified oil in situ was noted for both systems. The degree of agreement with experimental data is sensitive to the details of gas (gas/oil system) and oil (oil/water system) mobility. "

Foam is consistently generated by snap-off in the rough-walled, calcite fracture network during surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) injection and coinjection of gas and surfactant solution over a range of gas fractional flows. Boundary conditions are systematically changed including gas fractional flow, total flow rate, and liquid rates. Local sweep efficiency is evaluated through visualization of the propagation front and compared for pure gas injection, SAG injection, and coinjection. Foam as a mobility-control agent resulted in significantly improved areal sweep and delayed gas breakthrough. Gas-mobility reduction factors varied from approximately 200 to more than 1,000, consistent with observations of improved areal sweep. A shear-thinning foam flow behavior was observed in the fracture networks over a range of gas fractional flows. "

                    "abstract": "The impact of injection brine salinity and ionic composition on oil recovery has been an active area of research for the past 25\u00a0years. Evidence from laboratory studies and field tests suggests that implementing certain modifications to the ionic composition of the injection brine leads to greater oil recovery. The role of salinity modification is attributed to its ability to shift wettability of a rock surface toward water wetness. The amount of trapped oil released depends on the nature of rock, oil, and brine surface interactions. Reservoir rocks exhibit different affinities to fluids. Carbonates show stronger adsorption of oil films as opposed to the strongly water-wet and mixed-wet sandstones. The concentration of divalent ions and total salinity of the injection brine are other important factors to consider. Accordingly, this paper provides a review of laboratory and field studies of the role of brine composition on oil recovery from carbonaceous rock as well as rationalization of results using DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) theory of surface forces. DLVO evaluates the contribution of each component of the oil/brine/rock system to the wettability. Measuring zeta potential of each pair of surfaces by a charged particle suspension method is used to estimate double layer forces, disjoining pressure, and contact-angle. We demonstrate the applicability of the DLVO approach by showing a comprehensive experimental study that investigates the effect of divalent ions in carbonates, and uses disjoining pressure results to rationalize observations from core flooding and direct contact-angle measurements.

                    "abstract": "Evaluation of the effects of thermal recovery methods upon diatomaceous reservoirs with their inherent high porosity and low permeability is problematic in that diatoms, a main component of their namesake rock, are composed of amorphous, hydrous biogenic silica (Opal-A) and can alter when heated. The opal-A to opal-CT transformation, is readily apparent using imaging methods, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and petrophysical measurements when the rock has been fully converted. In laboratory experiments with partial transformation, these changes, if any, are subtle and easily missed due to the minute amount of alteration products and the substantial amount of natural variability within the rocks. For example, XRD measurements may show an increase of 1 wt % in opal-CT after an experiment. It is not apparent whether additional opal-CT either formed as a result of the experiment or is a relative enrichment caused by the dissolution of more susceptible minerals such as opal-A and pyrite. A new method based on nitrogen sorption was developed to detect silica-phase alteration in diatomaceous samples. We observed that nanometer-scale pore-size distributions as measured via nitrogen sorption and processed using the classic BJH method differ for opal-A and opal-CT reservoir samples. Opal-A samples have less nanometer-scale pore volume (~0.1 cc/g), smaller nanoscale pore sizes (~3.8 nm), and distinct pore-size distributions compared to samples containing opal-CT (e.g., 0.3 cc/g and 6.6 nm). This method detects subtle amounts of opal-CT in that samples containing only 3 wt % (XRD) exhibit a distinct opal-CT peak at 7.8 nm in one example. These nanometer-scale pore-size changes occur whether micrometer-scale pores either increase in size (dissolution) or decrease in size (alteration). This method was applied to reservoir and quarry diatomites before and after laboratory experiments conducted at ambient to 230 \u00b0C temperatures, pH values of 6 to 10, durations of 10 hours to two years, different fluids, various pressures, and a gamut of flow conditions including spontaneous imbibition, forced imbibition, and static. Supporting data such as water chemistry and XRD data were also measured. Comparison of before and after BJH pore-size distributions reveals a reduction in peak size when dissolution occurs and a shift to larger nanometer-scale pore sizes when alteration (converting to opal-CT) occurs. Many samples exhibit both characteristics. The inlet side of the cores exhibit more dissolution and alteration than the outlet side of the same core. Other factors could also contribute to these changes in the nanometer-scale pore structure such as fines mobilization and compaction. "

The impact of salinity is related to wettability alteration of the system toward more water wetness, demonstrated by a reduction in the measured oil-water contact-angles.

This is mainly because conventional multiphase fluid flow simulators, commonly used to predict oil recovery, do not incorporate directly the role of wettability conditions and contact-angles. This paper provides a new method to estimate the additional oil recovery that results from wettability alteration of carbonate cores. A pore network model (PNM) was used to predict relative permeability curves at different wettability conditions. The effect on oil recovery was quantified from imbibition relative permeability curves that were generated from the PNM. These curves were used to simulate displacements. The simulation was run using a brine tracking function that estimates the instantaneous relative permeability based on tracing the injection brine salinity. The proposed approach was applied to the experimental core-flood experiments reported by Alshakhs and Kovscek (2015a). The PNM was constructed for a representative bimodal carbonate system. A drainage capillary pressure curve from a mercury injection experiment guided the construction of the static model structure. The static PNM model generated two relative permeability sets that correspond to contact-angles of 95\u00b0 and 55\u00b0. The simulation results showed comparable additional oil recovery to observations from the experimental core-flood experiments, 7.5% compared to 6.4%, respectively. The good match supports that the additional oil recovery is mainly attributed to wettability alteration. "

                    "abstract": "An experimental investigation is presented that shows oil recovery and wettability changes accompanying alteration of injection water salinity. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the impact of salinity leading to greater oil recovery and the mechanisms that take place for carbonate rocks. A series of forced imbibition experiments was conducted using crude-oil at different total salinity and ionic composition. In the first test set, three brines of different salinity were injected sequentially into reservoir cores with realistic initial oil and water saturation. Additional incremental oil recovery of 4.4-6.4% of the original oil in place (OOIP) was observed, during the tertiary stage. The injection of synthetic seawater, that has a salinity of 55 kppm, was replaced by a new brine (MgSO4) of similar total salinity (45 kppm) and rich in Mg2+ and SO42- ions. Injection of twice-diluted seawater of 27 kppm, during the tertiary stage, yielded an incremental oil recovery of 0.9%. The effect of reducing the total salinity was evaluated in a second test set using outcrop limestone cores and another crude-oil. An incremental oil recovery increase of 6.5% was observed when twice-diluted seawater (29 kppm) was injected during the tertiary stage following seawater injection. Wettability alteration was assessed using classic crude-oil contact-angle tests on smooth calcite surfaces. Contact-angle measurements suggest that the release of oil is caused by a wettability shift toward water wetness. The static water contact-angle was reduced in first test set from 92.7\u00b0 to 55.4\u00b0 when the brine was switched from seawater to the magnesium-rich brine. Similar reduction was observed in the second test set. The static water contact-angle was reduced from 70.1\u00b0 to 58.9\u00b0 when the brine was switched from seawater to twice-diluted seawater. The contribution of the rock/brine/oil interactions to the wettability was evaluated by measuring zeta potential of water/oil and water/solid interfaces. DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) theory of surface forces, using the measured zeta potentials rationalized observations of oil recovery in the case of low water salinity. The finding of this work provides a new approach for utilizing salinity alteration to achieve greater oil recovery. The impact of water salinity is usually correlated with low water salinity or with increasing the concentration of the key divalent ions. This study combines both salinity modification schemes to increase tertiary oil recovery. "

                    "abstract": "One method to access unconventional, heavy-oil and natural bitumen resources is to apply in situ combustion (ISC) to oxidize in place a small fraction of the hydrocarbon thereby providing heat to reduce oil viscosity and pressure that enhances recovery. ISC is also attractive because it provides the opportunity to upgrade oil in-situ by increasing the API gravity and decreasing, for instance, sulfur content. The complex nature of petroleum as a multi-component mixture and the multi-step character of oxidation reactions complicates substantially the kinetic analysis of crude-oil oxidation. Isoconversional techniques provide model-free methods for estimating activation energy and naturally deconvolve multi-step reactions. The isoconversional fingerprint is, essentially, the profile of activation energy as a function of temperature (from low to high) of the sample. As such, isoconversional methods are also useful as a screening tool to categorize the burning characteristics of different oils. In the literature there are substantially different kinetic models for the representation of reactions during in situ combustion. Some models feature multistep reactions in series whereas other models combine series and parallel reaction steps. Interestingly, there is no study comparing these models with each other as well as consistent experimental data. In this study, the performance of different models proposed in the literature and a new model is tested using kinetic cell simulations and compared to new experimental data. As the basis of the comparison, the isoconversional fingerprints associated with the models existing in the literature are compared. Results indicate that most of the models proposed are unable to reproduce the typical isoconversional fingerprint measured for crude-oil combustion. This lack of agreement explains, in part, the poor predictability of reactive transport simulations of ISC. Importantly, this work illustrates a methodology for assessing the consistency of a kinetic model with experimental data and identifies physically consistent models. "

                    "abstract": "In addition to the physical processes relevant in conventional oil production, additional physical-chemical processes have to be considered for in-situ combustion. These processes include heat conduction, steam drive and the kinetics and thermodynamics of combustion. To determine the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, kinetic cell and combustion tube experiments were performed. In this study, oil from a commercially producing in-situ combustion field was sampled. A newly developed kinetic cell was used which enabled performing experiments at various heating rates. The large range of heating rates is used for describing the reactions in the combustion tube and near-wellbore as well as for the conditions at the front in a larger distance from the wells. The near-wellbore during in-situ combustion is characterized by fast movement of the combustion front, large heating rates at a given location and spatial separation of low-and high temperature combustion reactions. Once the front propagates further away from the wells, the speed of the front reduces to less than 0.05 m/d. At this speed of the front, heat conduction ahead of the front warms the reservoir up without oxygen being present. Oxygen arriving at the front results in Low and High Temperature Oxidation occurring almost simultaneously. The far-field conditions were mimicked by pre-heating a kinetic cell prior to exposing it to air. These experiments showed that for these conditions, the high and low temperature oxidation reactions cannot be distinguished and could be approximated by a single reaction. This study shows that a simplified reaction scheme might be used to simulate the reservoir effects of combustion whereas for simulating the early phase of an in-situ combustion project, a more exhaustive set of chemical reactions might be required. The results of the study can be used to investigate the start-up phase of an in-situ combustion project (near-wellbore effect focus) and the effects during advancement of the combustion front in the reservoir. Using the example of a Central European field operated using in-situ combustion in a line-drive configuration, the near-wellbore and far field operational aspects are shown. "

To increase understanding of oil-water relative permeability behavior as a function of temperature, we conducted and interpreted laboratory-scale experiments. In these studies, high-temperature, spontaneous and forced isothermal water imbibition tests were conducted on diatomaceous reservoir core samples of clayey and sandy types. Tests were carried out at temperatures of 45 and 230 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F and 446 \u00b0F). Tests included spontaneous counter-current water imbibition followed by forced co-current water imbibition to residual oil saturation. Wettability shift was assessed experimentally through the Amott index. Dependence of endpoint phase saturation and relative permeability on temperature was also apparent. The wettability response observed indicates wettability transition to greater water-wetness with increasing temperature. X-ray computed tomography imaging provided the 3D distribution of porosity and aided us in following the spatial distribution of water saturation as a function of time in the samples throughout the imbibition process. Water saturation evolution varied among samples. Front-like water advance and more or less uniform imbibition were measured. Heterogeneity at the core scale was evident in both porosity and water saturation images. A commercial simulator was used to model and to history match core-scale flow behavior. Relative permeability curves were created consistent with the experimentally found oil and water relative permeability endpoints. Importantly, a heterogeneous wettability distribution was incorporated in one case to match experimental observations. Study results include relative permeability curves and wettability indices as a function of temperature. "

Etched silicon micromodels with well-characterized pore networks were used during single-phase flow to examine the retention of 0.2\u00a0wt% partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) solution. Image analysis included an image subtraction and an RGB-based global thresholding technique for quantification of polymer retention/adsorption. Results are reported as the percentage of porosity occupied by immobile polymer. Three factors were investigated including the salinity of displacing water, the change of wettability of the micromodel surface, and mechanical degradation of polymer. With respect to salinity in displacing water, the experiment confirmed that 5\u00a0wt% NaCl results in less polymer retention (6.3\u00b10.3%) than without NaCl (7.5\u00b10.3%). The increase in Na+ concentration was sufficient to induce contraction of the size of the flexible HPAM molecules and, therefore, decrease the thickness of polymer adsorption on the grain. Two methods were used to alter the initially strongly water-wet surface of the micromodel. Wettability was changed by the deposition of crude oil and CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) in aqueous solution. The micromodels treated using crude oil and CTAB showed polymer retention of 15.0\u00b10.3%% and 5.0\u00b10.3%%, respectively. Oil-wet micromodels aged by crude oil showed larger polymer retention than the polymer retention on water-wet micromodels (7.5\u00b10.3%). Otherwise, the polymer retention on the CTAB treated micromodel was lower than the polymer retention on the water-wet micromodel. Finally, polymer solution flowed through a 7\u00a0\u00b5m filter was tested. Average polymer retention was 4.3\u00b10.3% and this is 3.2\u00b10.3% point lower than the value of unfiltered polymer solution. Further investigation of microgels within pore networks provided a chance to demonstrate that a size and structural flexibility of microgel leading to a transition from mobile to immobile conditions.

                    "abstract": "Secondary recovery methods typically recover about 50% of the original oil in place. To recover the remaining oil, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods that reduce capillary effects and/or improve mobility ratio are implemented. In this work, several chemical EOR experiments were conducted and recovery mechanisms in carbonate and sandstone-like pore structures were visualized using micromodels. The objective of these experiments was to enhance our understanding of fluid flow and oil recovery mechanisms through utilization of surfactant solution as the main injectant. Surfactants were used to minimize capillary effects at the pore level by reducing interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water. Alkali was also added to the injectant to reduce adsorption of surfactant to solid surfaces. In some cases, the injectant was augmented by the addition of polymers to increase the viscosity and consequently decrease the injected phase mobility. Micromodels are two dimensional representations of a pore network that provide a means of visualizing fluid-flow experiments under a microscope. To achieve a better understanding of the key parameters that impact ultimate recovery, various elements require investigations using time-consuming experiments; some are not even practical. An alternative is to run a few experiments to validate a fluid-flow simulator. The simulator is then utilized to run numerous cases in a relatively shorter time compared to physical experiments. This paper discusses the micromodel experiments and the simulation runs performed to validate the numerical model. Initially, experiments were history matched utilizing a commercial numerical simulator. The simulation model was capable of reproducing similar results demonstrated in the micromodel experiments. Consequently, these results will be used to assist in designing chemical-flood experiments to acquire a broader understanding of fluid flow and ultimately achieve better oil recovery. "

This number is even lower in fractured resources where injected water selectively channels through fractures towards producers leaving much of the oil trapped in the matrix. To improve oil recovery in such systems, one option is to reduce the fracture uptake by increasing the viscosity of the injectant using polymers or foam. Another option is to inject surfactant solutions. In this work, the effect of surfactant flood mode on oil recovery in fractured carbonates is investigated. Experiments are conducted vertically to maximize gravity effects and are monitored by an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner to quantify fluid saturations. In one experiment, waterflood was implemented followed by surfactant flood (tertiary flood mode). In another experiment, surfactant flood was implemented directly after obtaining initial oil and water saturations with no waterflood (secondary flood mode). Novel aspects of this work include the use of a special core holder that allows for saturating the core and conducting a spontaneous imbibition experiment while the setup is mounted to the CT scanner. The surfactant in these experiments reduced interfacial tension (IFT) from 40 mN/m to 0.001 mN/m. The ultimate recovery (UR) in the tertiary experiment was around 55% while the UR for the secondary experiment was about 62%. Initially, more oil was mobilized with the waterflood in the tertiary experiment than the secondary experiment. The secondary experiment, however, surpasses the tertiary experiment in terms of oil recovery after 11 pore volume injected (PVI). This work highlights the impact of implementation time for surfactant floods in fractured carbonates. It was observed that more oil is recovered ultimately when surfactant solution is injected early in the life of a flood. "

During foam injection for enhanced oil recovery, microvisual data revealed that the aqueous phase advanced as film flow along water-wet grains whereas discontinuous gas bubbles were located in the center of pores.

During ISC, air is injected into a reservoir to oxidize a small portion of the hydrocarbons present thereby generating heat and pressure that enhance recovery. We have conducted a screening study to evaluate the likelihood of the success of ISC in Karamay. Questions of interest for Karamay include the fraction of the crude oil that is converted to fuel, the quantity of particular crude-oil components that become fuel for ISC, and the ability to propagate a combustion front through porous media. To investigate ISC properties of the oil, true boiling point fractions were collected from Karamay crude oil and the kinetics of oxidation of each fraction in porous media were measured using ramped temperature oxidation (RTO) and compared to the whole crude oil. The isoconversional approach is used to interpret the RTO results of each boiling point fraction to obtain the activation energy characteristics of each boiling point fraction. With increasing boiling point and, consequently, molecular weight, the ignition temperature as well as the temperature for the onset of oxidation increases. Fuel availability increased with pseudocomponent density. The 500+\u00b0C boiling point fraction presents reaction kinetics most similar to the whole crude oil indicating that the crude-oil components in this fraction contribute the most to fuel production. Reaction kinetics of the whole oil appeared to be favorable for successful propagation of a combustion front. Importantly, this prediction was validated using displacement tests in a 1\u00a0m long combustion tube filled with reservoir sands. The Karamay crude oil demonstrated significant in-situ upgrading as a result of ISC. The gravity of the produced oil was 19.3\u00b0 API. Our results add to the knowledge base of conditions for successful ISC as well as significant upgrading. "

This number is even lower in fractured carbonates where the injected water selectively channels through fractures towards producers leaving much of the oil trapped in the matrix. To mitigate the low recovery, one option is to reduce fracture uptake by increasing the viscosity of the injected fluids using polymers or foam. Anothet option, which is the objective of this work, is to inject surfactant solutions to reduce capillary effects responsible for trapping oil and allow gravity to segregate oil by buoyancy. Analysis of gravity and capillary forces suggests that such segregation is achievable in the laboratory provided that cores are moderately long and oriented vertically. Besides investigating gravity effects on oil recovery, the effect of surfactant flood mode (secondary flood mode and tertiary flood mode) on the ultimate recovery (UR) was also investigated. To investigate the predictions of this analysis, core-flood experiments are conducted using carbonate cores and monitored by an X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner to quantify fluid saturation history in situ. Novel aspects of this work include cores that are oriented both horizontally and vertically to maximize gravitational effects as well as a special core holder that mimics aspects of fractured systems using whole core. This paper discusses the contrast in experimental results in vertical and horizontal orientation with and without surfactant. To study gravity effect, the used surfactant reduced interfacial tension (IFT) from 40 mN/m to 3 mN/m. For this mode of recovery, ultralow IFT is not preferred because some capillary action is needed to aid injectant transport into the mnatrix. The vertical experiment showed that gravity has the potential of improving oil recovery at low IFT. Although the IFT reduction was not large (one order of magnitude reduction), recovery factor (RF) of more than 7%. Another surfactant was used to study the flood mode effect; the used surfactant reduced IFT from 40 mN/m to 0.001 mN/m (ultralow IFT). In this study, two experimentas were conducted: a tertary surfactant flood experiment and a secondary surfactant flood experiment. The secondary flood experiment showed an increase of 7% in the ultimate recovery factor (IRF) compared to the tertiary flood experiment. This work highlights the importance of gravity at low IFT in terms of mobilizing trapped oil and also the impact of flood mode on UR. Moreover, this work emphasizes on the use of surfactant solutions as a method of enhancing oil recovery in fractured resources not necessarily due to wettability alteration but mainly due to gravity effects. Results are presented primarily as 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of in-situ oil and water phase saturation. "

                    "abstract": "Evaluation of thermal-recovery processes requires relative permeability functions, how such functions change with temperature, as well as the evolution of rock permeability and porosity as floods progress. There are significant challenges associated with estimating relative permeability, and its temperature dependence, from laboratory data including the accuracy of data and generalized assumptions in the interpretation technique. Direct measurements of relative permeability curves through the steady-state method are ideal and scarce, in particular for low-permeability systems. This study reports the results of a long-term study to measure the steady-state oil/water relative permeability as a function of temperature of a core sample from a low-permeability, siliceous shale, diatomite reservoir. All tests were isothermal, carried out at temperatures ranging from 45 to 230 oC (113 oF \u2013 446 oF). In-situ phase saturation was monitored using an X-ray CT scanner. Results obtained show a systematic shift towards increased water wettability with increasing temperature. Dependence of endpoint phase saturation and relative permeability with temperature is apparent from these measurements thereby confirming the transition to water-wetness with increasing temperature previously derived from spontaneous imbibition experiments on previous diatomite samples. A post-mortem analysis of sample porosity distribution and rock quality reveals the evolution of additional petrophysical attributes as a result of two years of thermal flooding. Introduction The study of oil recovery from diatomite is of particular interest due to the estimated 12-18 Bbbl of original oil in place (Ilderton et al., 1996). Diatomaceous reservoir rocks are characterized by high porosity (between 35 - 70%), low permeability (0.1-10 mD) (Schwartz, 1988), small pore throat diameters of 45 microns or less (Johnston and Shahin, 1995; Jia et al., 2007), and a favorable response to thermally enhanced recovery methods (Schembre et al., 2006a). Steam injection in drive (Johnston and Shahin, 1995; Kovscek et al., 1996a; Kovscek et al., 1996b) or cyclic modes (Murer et al., 2000; Kumar and Beatty, 1995) is being implemented for light and heavy-oil diatomite reservoirs. Virtually all enhanced recovery processes for diatomite rely to an extent on spontaneous and/or forced imbibition of water (Tang and Kovscek, 2002). At field scale, the pressure gradients applied are variable such that both spontaneous and forced imbibition may take place. During spontaneous imbibition, the non-wetting phase is displaced by the wetting phase as a result of capillary action. The efficiency of the imbibition process depends strongly on the phase viscosities, and it is also a function of the temperature, interfacial tension, initial water saturation, pore structure, and relative permeability (Zhou et al., 2000). Relative permeability is a fluid-mechanical property that integrates wettability conditions to describe simultaneous flow of more than one fluid. It is a dimensionless ratio between the effective permeability of a phase normalized to absolute permeability at a given saturation. It depends upon several parameters such as pore-scale geometry and distribution, rock-fluid interaction, initial fluid saturation and distribution, and fluid-flow properties (Goda and Behrenbruch, 2004). As complex functions of the structure and chemistry of the fluids and solids in a producing reservoir, relative permeabilities can vary from place to place in the reservoir. Generally, laboratory measurements are used to determine relative permeability curves, but network models are emerging as routes of estimating capillary pressure and relative permeability functions. For example, Jia et al. (2007) discuss incorporation of pore-scale diatomite information into a pore network model. "

                    "abstract": "Reservoir rocks typically have clay and other fine material attached to pore surfaces. Fines mobilization is advantageous in that the removal of fines from pore walls exposes water-wet rock thereby aiding oil recovery. On the other hand, fines mobilization is deleterious if mobilized particles obstruct pore throats. In this work, waterfloods of diatomaceous cores up to 200\u00a0\u00b0C were conducted using field and outcrop samples to elucidate mechanisms of fines production at conditions potentially important to thermal oil recovery. Because the rock employed is also stress sensitive, it was necessary to also understand compaction in order to gauge any resulting changes in permeability. The effect of temperature on fines migration in situ was studied using time-lapse CT scanning and the resulting permeability reduction was measured and modeled. The temperature at which increased fines concentration is observed coincides with an increase in the range of oscillations of X-ray attenuation in an averaged area in the CT images. Permeability reduction of up to 80% was seen in some cases at high temperatures confirming the importance of temperature in the elution of fines. It was found that the permeability reduction is more sensitive to salinity and temperature in comparison to pH. Such modeling and experimentation provides guidance on appropriate mitigation strategies through completion or other methods. Effluent brine analysis confirms that silica dissolution is an important factor in hot water or steam condensate movement with all of the tests indicating that silica dissolved in increasing quantities with increasing temperatures, even producing precipitates at 150\u2013200\u00a0\u00b0C. Silica in solution leads to a general decrease in the effluent pH due to silicic acid. Ion exchange was also observed that is consistent with the Hofmeister series. Cations of large valency and smaller hydrated radii displaced cations resident in the rock. The effect of confining pressure on permeability was investigated by repeated loading and unloading of outcrop cores at different intermediate pressures and temperatures. With increasing net effective stress, significant permeability degradation was observed with a noticeable acceleration at about 600\u00a0psia. Mercury porosimetry of damaged material indicates that changes may be due to pore collapse. Almost no permeability recovery was detected when the core was unloaded. Significant creep was observed with significant permeability reduction resulting from a constant applied confining pressure. Permeability reduction at a slightly smaller effective stress was observed for the high temperature cases but no significant material differences in the primary compaction curves were detected between 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 100\u00a0\u00b0C. Limited rebound suggests that the stress history of diatomites may be a significant factor in determining the degree of acceptable depletion in the field development planning for thermal operations.

In our work, we investigate a two-parameter model (the \u03c9(CS)-model) relating surfactant concentration directly to the miscibility factor used to modify phase residuals and shapes of the relative permeability functions in SP-flood modeling. We find that despite its simplicity, the \u03c9(CS)-model for miscibility factor is able to reproduce results using the prevalent capillary desaturation curve approach (CDC-model). We first study a synthetic, two-dimensional reservoir with three injectors and three producers and then apply our approach to a realistic three-dimensional field example. We use streamline simulation to model the fluid flow in the reservoir, although the miscibility factor model is not limited to streamline simulation. The main feature of the\u00a0\u03c9(CS) model is that the miscibility factor is only a function of surfactant concentration rather than surfactant concentration and Darcy velocity as in the CDC-model. While simpler models, such as the one proposed here are not predictive for core-scale simulations, simple models are the only practical way to find near-optimal solutions under the constraint of geological uncertainty, poor data, and many wells.

While one-dimensional experiments are conducted at average reservoir conditions, reservoir heterogeneities may have an impact on the amount of fuel formed and, consequently, the amount of heat generated. Therefore, prior to field applications of any potential candidates, it is essential to understand the upper and lower limits of the reservoir rock and fluid properties, and how ISC functions within those limits. In this study, the effect of varying connate water saturation, initial oil saturation, clay content, permeability, and porosity are investigated with one-dimensional combustion tube experiments on different heavy crudes (8-20 \u00b0API) with asphaltene content ranging from 10 to 18 wt% for different reservoir rocks including carbonates and sandstone. Process dynamics for good and poor ISC candidates are discussed in terms of effluent gas composition, temperature profiles and histories, total experiment time, oil recovery, behavior of fluid (oil, water, steam, and gas) front movements, and the level of oil upgrading at different reservoir conditions. Fuel consumption along with air requirements are analyzed for each experiment analytically. For good ISC candidates as identified by laboratory screening, the reservoir conditions that may lead to poor ISC field performance are estimated. It is observed that the reactivity of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures (in the presence of oxygen) and the initial oil saturation are two important parameters that influence the fate of ISC. The findings considerably advance our understanding of field-scale ISC through the evaluation and interpretation of experimental data for different reservoir conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Spontaneous imbibition (SI) is generally defined as displacement of non-wetting phase by wetting phase with counter-current multiphase flow through dominant capillary force in porous media. SI is a critical phenomenon in oil recovery from strongly water-wet and highly fractured reservoirs. The rate of SI depends on permeabilities, relative permeabilities, shapes, boundary conditions, fluid viscosity, interfacial tension, and wettability. The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of characteristic length (CL), boundary conditions (BC), mobility ratios, and initial water saturation conditions on the rate of spontaneous imbibition. We conducted spontaneous countercurrent and co-current water imbibition into cylindrical Berea sandstone (water-wet), Indiana limestone (oil-wet), Texas Creme limestone (oil-wet) with different boundary conditions, characteristic length, and various initial water saturations (from Swi=0 to Swi = 0.5). Brine (1 wt% NaCl) is used as the wetting fluid. Also, air, decane (n-C10), and Blandol are used as non-wetting fluids, respectively to compare the effect of a mobility ratio. To measure the rate of imbibition and oil production from each core, we used an X-ray computerized tomography (CT) scanner and a imbibition cell. The observed 2-D and 3-D saturation profile histories on each rock through CT scanner show clearly different imbibition patterns for each boundary condition. Also, low permeability limestones have more heterogeneous features than sandstones. We used three different boundary conditions (BC) including (1) all faces open (AFO), (2) two ends open (TEO, i.e., inlet and outlet face), and (3) one end open (OEO, i.e., one face of the core) systems. The effect of characteristic length (CL) and mobility ratios on the imbibition recovery curve was investigated using different scaling groups (dimensionless time, tD). CL had an inverse effect on the rate of spontaneous imbibition within the same core samples. BC experiments showed the effect of total open surface area for the oil production rate of spontaneous imbibition with different Swi. The different mobility ratios show the different oil production profile with same time-scale. Finally, the generalized correlation (Aronofsy's equation) was introduced to show the agreement with experimental data. "

Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations have been carried out with an external driving force imposed on the 3-D carbon pore network generated atomistically using the Voronoi tessellation method, representative of the carbon-based kerogen porous structure of shale, to investigate helium transport and predict Klinkenberg parameters. Simulations are conducted to determine the effect of pressure on gas permeability in the pore network structure. In addition, pressure pulse decay experiments have been conducted to measure the helium permeability and Klinkenberg parameters of a shale core plug to establish a comparison between permeability measurements in the laboratory and the permeability predictions using NEMD simulations. The results indicate that the gas permeability, obtained from pulse-decay experiments, is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that calculated by the MD simulation. The experimental permeability, however, is extracted from early-time pressure profiles that correspond to convective flow in shale macropores (>\u00a050\u00a0nm). That is, pore diameters estimated from the measured permeability are greater than 50\u00a0nm. "

The effectiveness of solar TEOR was quantified through reservoir simulation, economic analysis, and life-cycle assessment. Reservoir simulations with continuous but variable rate steam injection were compared with a base-case Tulare Sand steamflood project. For equivalent average injection rates, comparable breakthrough times and recovery factors of 65% of the original oil in place were predicted, in agreement with simulations in the literature. Daily cyclic fluctuations in steam injection rate do not greatly impact recovery. Oil production rates do, however, show seasonal variation. Economic viability was established using historical prices and injection/production volumes from the Kern River oil field. For comparison, this model assumes that present day steam generation technologies were implemented at TEOR startup in 1980. All natural gas cogeneration and 100% solar fraction scenarios had the largest and nearly equal net present values (NPV) of $12.54 B and $12.55 B, respectively. Solar fraction refers to the steam provided by solar steam generation. Given its large capital cost, the 100% solar case shows the greatest sensitivity to discount rate and no sensitivity to natural gas price. Because there are very little emissions associated with day-to-day operations from the solar thermal system, life-cycle emissions are significantly lower than conventional systems even when the embodied energy of the structure is considered. We estimate that less than 1\u00a0g of CO2/MJ of refined gasoline results from the TEOR stage of production if solar energy provides all steam. By this assessment, solar thermal or supplemental solar generation systems appear to be a preferred alternative to fully conventional systems using natural gas in areas with large solar insolation. "

Field applications of ISC are limited, however,because the process is complex and not well-understood. A significant open question for ISC is the formation of coke or \"fuel\" in correct quantities that is sufficiently reactive to sustain combustion. We study ISC from a laboratory perspective in 1 m long combustion tubes that allow monitoring of the progress of the combustion front by use of X-ray computed tomography (CT) and temperature profiles. Two crude oils--with 12\u00b0 API (986 kg/m3) and9\u00b0 API (1007 kg/m3)--are studied. Cross-sectional images of oil movement and banking in situ are obtained through the appropriate analysis of the spatially and temporally varying CT numbers. Combustion-tube runs are quenched before front breakthrough at the production end, thereby permitting apost-mortem analysis of combustion products and, in particular, the fuel (coke and coke-like residues) just downstream of the combustion front. Fuel is analyzed with both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS). XPS and SEM results are used to identify the shape, texture, and elemental composition of fuel in the X-ray CT images. The SEM andXPS results aid efforts to differentiate among combustion-tube results with significant and negligible amounts of clay minerals. Initial results indicate that clays increase the surface area of fuel deposits formed, and this aids combustion. In addition, comparisons are made of coke-like residues formed during experiments under an inert nitrogen atmosphere and from in-situ combustion. Study results contribute to an improved mechanistic understanding of ISC, fuel formation, and the role of mineral substrates in either aiding or impeding combustion. CT imaging permits inference of the width and movement of the fuel zone in-situ. "

High molecular weight polyacrylamide polymers show shear-thinning behavior when measured in a rheometer while they show shear-thickening behavior in cores. Micromodel experiments were used to investigate the rheological properties of polyacrylamide polymers at the high flow velocity conditions occurring in the near-wellbore region of wells. The results show shear-thickening characteristics. In addition, some plugging of the models by polymers was observed despite filtering of solutions. Also, core flood tests were performed. For the core-flood tests, severe degradation of the polymers was observed for high flow velocities. The data gathered from the experiments was used to interpret the results of a polymer solution injection test performed in the 8 Torton horizon reservoir in Austria. Shear-thickening behavior of the polymers would lead to very high well-head pressures. Through introduction of the degraded polymer viscosity data obtained from the laboratory experiments, the injection pressure observed in the field is explained. The field test showed that after a first phase of polymer solution injection under matrix conditions, a second phase with injection above the formation parting pressure (FPP) exists. To investigate the polymer rheology during this phase, micromodel experiments with various fracture geometries were conducted. The results show that within the induced fractures, polymer solutions show shear-thinning behavior and no substantial degradation of the polymers is seen. Owing to the low flow velocities through the fracture planes into the formation, also within the formation, no severe degradation of the polymers is expected. Hence, high molecular weight polyacrylamide polymers should be injected above the FPP when high flow velocities are expected in the near-wellbore region and such injection is permissible. "

If gas shale is desired to be used as a storage medium for CO2, then knowledge of how to maintain gas permeability while enhancing storage via sorption is mandatory. In this work, physical and numerical pressure-transient, pulse-decay experiments are conducted on Eagle Ford shale cores. The experiments are conducted isothermally at various pore and confining pressures that maintain a constant net effective stress. The gases investigated are helium, methane, and carbon dioxide. Porosity and permeability measurements are conducted using various techniques including numerical simulation that incorporates detailed measurements of the in-situ, core-scale porosity distribution. The research simulator is fully implicit, finite volume, unconditionally stable, and incorporates gas sorption in ultra-small pore networks. Langmuir sorption parameters are determined after matching the upstream and downstream pressure profiles simultaneously. Experiments are also interpreted using available analytical models and compared to the high-resolution simulations matched to experimental observations. Results highlight the interplay of gas slip and sorption of pure gases at core-level. Results also quantify the role of CO2 sorption in various shale fabrics and thus promote the potential for sequestration. While the gas molecular kinematic diameter plays a role in dictating the pore accessibility, and thus governs slip flow, gas sorption is more influential in determining permeability. Gas transport in wide channels, however, undermines the influence of sorption on measured permeability. While He is a non-sorptive gas, CH4 sorption isotherms are described by a Langmuir model and CO2 isotherms are similar to an n-BET model. The experiments demonstrate that He and CH4 have a similar measured permeability while carbon dioxide has a lower permeability. These differences are attributed to the strong sorption of carbon dioxide. "

The processes leading to increased oil production occur on a large scale--improving vertical and areal sweep efficiency--but they begin on a microscale. Micromodels with realistic pore geometries have been created. These micromodels were saturated with viscous oil, and the displacement of the oil bywater and polymer solutionswas investigated experimentally. Polymer injection reduced fingering compared with water injection and increased sweep efficiency accordingly. The micromodel pore-network geometry was digitized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The digitized model was used to perform computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) simulation of the displacement processes. The displacement efficiencies and displacement patterns of the CFD simulations with water, polymer solutions, and polymer solutions after water breakthrough at the outlet end to displace oil were very similar to the results of the micromodel experiments. Then, the CFD simulations were used to investigate the displacement at the pore scale. Water injection leads to the creation of fingers along slightly more-permeable flow paths. The number and length of the fingers decrease if polymer solution is injected. Even for polymer injection after water breakthrough, the fingering is reduced, polymer solutions are diverted into less-favorable flow paths, and sweep efficiency is increased. CFD simulations can also be used to look into non-Newtonian fluid behavior at the pore scale. The polymers injected in the micromodel experiments exhibited shear-thinning behavior. On a pore scale, CFD simulations showed that the shear stress and viscosity of the polymer solutions accordingly are significantly lower in the pore throats than in the pores. Thus, the displacement efficiency of the polymer solutions is affected by the shear-thinning behavior. The CFD simulations are in remarkable agreement with the micromodel experiments and can be used to quantify the displacement processes at pore scale. "

ISC also has dramatically lower requirements for water and natural gas, and potentially a smaller surface footprint, in comparison with steam. In spite of its apparent advantages, prediction of the likelihood of successful ISC is unclear. Conventionally, combustion tube tests of a crude oil and rock are used to infer that ISC works at reservoir scale and estimate the oxygen requirements. Combustion tube results may lead to field-scale simulation on a coarse grid with upscaled Arrhenius reaction kinetics. As an alternative, we suggest a comprehensive workflow to predict successful combustion at the reservoir scale. The method is derived from experimental laboratory data and simulation models at all scales. In our workflow, a sample of crushed reservoir rock or an equivalent synthetic sample is mixed with water/brine and the crude-oil sample. The mixture is placed in a kinetics cell reactor and oxidized at different heating rates. An isoconversional method is used to estimate kinetic parameters vs. temperature and combustion characteristics of the sample. Results from the isoconversional interpretation provide a first screen of the likelihood that a combustion front is propagated successfully. Then, a full-physics simulation of the kinetics cell experiment is used to predict the flue gas composition. The model combines a detailed pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) analysis of the multiphase system and a multistep reaction model. A mixture identical to that tested in the kinetics cell is also burned in a combustion tube experiment. Temperature profiles along the tube, as well as the flue gas compositions, are measured during the experiment. A high-resolution simulation model of the combustion tube test is developed and validated. Finally, the high-resolution model is used as a basis for scaling up the reaction model to field dimensions. Field-scale simulations do not use Arrhenius kinetics. As a result, significant stiffness is removed from the finite-difference simulation of the governing equations. Preliminary field-scale simulation shows little sensitivity to gridblock size, and the computational work per timestep is much reduced. "

                    "title": "Optimal Voidage Replacement Ratio for Viscous and Heavy Oil Waterfloods",
                    "abstract": "Historically a voidage replacement ratio (VRR) of 1 is assumed to be optimal for oil recovery regardless of whether recovery occurs from an unconventional heavy oil reservoir or a conventional oil reservoir. That is, it is assumed that of all scenarios, the most oil recovery occurs when the amount of fluids injected into the subsurface equals the amount produced. Recent work publications have analyzed both field and core-scale data to conclude that a VRR of 1 is suboptimal for certain viscous and heavy-oil reservoirs. In this work, we use numerical simulation to seek an understanding of the conditions under which a VRR of 1 is suboptimal. Models are core-size to enable better interpretation of mechanisms. We tested the sensitivity of the optimal VRR to the curvature of our relative permeability relationships (i.e., Corey exponent), the critical gas saturation, the three-phase flow model, potential chemistry of the oil, the statistics of permeability values, the connectivity of low and high permeability regions, and the reference scale at which results are compared. Realistic relative permeability curves based off rock and fluid interactions observed in the literature were developed and used in the majority of our simulations. We find that gas mobility is an influential parameter in determining the optimal VRR at core scale. As the gas mobility decreases relative to oil and water and/or the reservoir heterogeneity increases, a VRR below 1 becomes more favorable. The heterogeneity and its connectivity also influenced the optimal VRR to a lesser extent. Introduction The concept of using solution-gas drive to assist in waterflooding is certainly not new (Dyes 1954). Operating below the bubblepoint pressure so that some gas evolves from the oil solution has been shown to improve recovery during waterflooding by 7 to 12% compared to operating at or above the bubblepoint. It was suggested there is an optimum reservoir pressure at which to operate a waterflood and that speeding up production rates improves attainment of this optimum pressure. Even with some experimental evidence pointing to increased recovery through combining waterflood and solution-gas drive, many disadvantages are prescribed to dropping the pressure of a reservoir (or core) below the bubblepoint pressure. The introduction of an additional phase may reduce the relative mobility of the oil. Also, in heavy and viscous-oil reservoirs, when the reservoir pressure goes below the bubblepoint, gas evolves from oil and the oil-phase viscosity increases, making the oil less mobile. This problem is compounded because gas flows easily out of the reservoir thereby reducing reservoir pressure at a much faster rate compared to depletion above the bubblepoint. Further problems occur when the rock compressibility is relatively large and subsidence occurs. Employing operating strategies and heuristics from conventional settings to unconventional settings may lead to erroneous procedures. The differences between conventional oil recovery and heavy-oil/viscous-oil recovery mechanisms have been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g., Firoozabadi and Aronson 1999, Tang et al. 2006a, Vittoratos et al. 2006). Due to the unfavorable mobility of heavy oil relative to water, a substantial fraction of waterflooded oil is only recovered after water breakthrough at high water cut (Tang and Kovscek 2011, Vittoratos et al. 2007). Below the bubble point, the characteristic large viscosity of heavy oil and foamy oil effects, or gas emulsions in the liquid oil, retard gas flow thereby maintaining reservoir (or core) energy. Gas retention within the porous medium substantially extends the solution-gas-drive process in time and increases crude-oil recovery (Tang et al. 2006 a,b). "

                    "abstract": "The use of solar thermal steam generation for heavy-oil recovery has the advantage of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as well as offsets the cost variability of steam generation due to fluctuations in natural gas prices. Daily cyclic fluctuations in steam injection rate associated with sunlight hours, along with hydrocarbon production and heating/cooling of rock cause changes to reservoir stress. This paper focuses on the dilation and compaction behaviors associated with continuous but variable-rate solar generated steam injection. Our approach integrates geomechanical models with the reservoir simulation model. The challenge with integrating geomechanics with reservoir models is to find accurate and sufficient data for stress field and orientation, dilation and compaction pressures, and the fracture pressure for the formation. We evaluate the viability of a solar thermal steam generation system with natural gas back-up for thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) in heavy-oil sands that includes geomechanical coupling with the reservoir. Coupled reservoir-geomechanical simulation runs with continuous variable steam injection were compared with the base-case uncoupled Tulare Sand steamflood project. Sensitivity analyses for dilation parameters were studied to understand their effects on the overall oil recovery and breakthrough times. Significant pore pressure variation to trigger compaction was not observed for reasonable day-time injection rates of up to 1000 BBL cold-water equivalent (CWE)/d in high permeability formations. The injection pressures were maintained much below the fracture pressure of the formation in all cases. To summarize, a solar thermal steam generation approach for thermal enhanced oil recovery is a promising technique for supplementing steam generation in areas with large solar insolation. 1. Introduction Thermal recovery methods in general, and steam injection in particular, are the most popular EOR processes. Steam injection is required in heavy-oil reservoirs to obtain economic oil production and in mature oil fields to improve ultimate oil recovery. Oil recovery using steam accounts for more than 50% of the total US EOR production (Oil & Gas Journal, April 2012). Induced stress change during fluid production from hydrocarbon reservoirs, and steam injection for EOR may lead to rock deformation and risk of well failures & ground movement (Settari & Walters, 1999).

                    "abstract": "Hamaca (Orinoco Belt, Venezuela) is considered here as a typical viscous and heavy oil whose rheology and recovery behavior is potentially modified by diluents and aqueous solutions of alkali. Viscosity of dry Hamaca crude oil, mixtures of Hamaca and n-decane, as well as emulsified crude oil was measured ex-situ and in-situ (sand pack) as a function of temperature and shear rate. Hamaca crude oil exhibits temperature-dependent rheological behavior. Between 30 and 50\u00b0\u00a0C, it is slightly shear thinning, whereas from 55 to 80\u00b0\u00a0C, properties are slightly shear-thickening. Shear stress sensitivity becomes greater as shear rate decreases. Crude oil rheological behavior in a sand pack (single-phase flow) has similar trends as bulk crude-oil viscometer measurements. The viscosity of the crude oil decreases most significantly as the concentration of diluent (decane) increases from 0 to 6\u00a0wt% but the magnitude of viscosity reduction is less as diluent concentration increases from 10% to 33%. After mixing crude oil with aqueous alkaline silicate and carbonate solutions, viscosity decreases markedly due to formation of oil in water (o/w) emulsions. For sodium hydroxide, however, oil viscosity increases because of formation of water in oil (w/o) emulsions. Given the encouraging changes in bulk oil properties, core flood recovery tests at different temperatures and flow rates were conducted. Alkaline flooding showed recovery of about 43% after 0.5 PV of injection and more than 60% with 5.6\u00a0PV of 1\u00a0wt% Na2CO3 solution. A significant fraction of the oil recovery occurred as o/w emulsion. The apparent relative permeability of the oil phase deviates markedly from the measurements for unemulsified oil. "

A greater understanding of the flow patterns that evolve during such unstable displacements yields insights into improving predictive capability and increasing oil recovery. Immiscible multiphase displacement exhibits a wide range of behaviors depending on the relative magnitude of viscous, capillary, and gravity forces. Using flow-visualization images from forced-imbibition experiments carried out in etched-silicon micromodels, we show that the conventional Darcy-type modeling of fluid flux is not predictive under unstable, immiscible, forced-imbibition conditions at the scale of interest. When a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous fluid at low capillary numbers, the displacement patterns show viscous instabilities in the form of fingers and local capillary control of interface movement. We show that such complex displacement patterns are well modeled using statistical theories. We derive a scaling model to describe quantitatively the functional forms for saturation, fractional flow, and capillary dispersion profiles using the self-similar characteristics inherent in the displacement patterns. For the specific range of flow rates (Nc ~ 10-7) and oil/water viscosity ratios (M ~ 8-400) considered in our experiments, both capillary and viscous forces are important, and the displacement pattern indicates fractal features. Results show that functional relations of the scaling model are in considerable agreement with our experimental data. "

Heat thins heavy oils reducing viscosity, improving producibility substantially, and shifts rock wettability to conditions more favorable for oil recovery. While thermal recovery is typically applied to heavy and viscous oils in sand matrices, thermal techniques are also applicable to lighter oils and to more heterogeneous formations. Because most thermal oil production is achieved today using steam generated on the surface by burning natural gas, thermal recovery has an environmental footprint that is larger when compared to conventional oil production. The relatively large surface footprint, water demand, and carbon dioxide emissions from steam generation have all emerged as challenges for thermally enhanced oil production. This article outlines the current technical, economic, and environmental issues associated with thermal oil recovery. It also presents potential solutions and mitigation measures. Techniques such as solar heat to displace fossil fuels for steam generation, in-situ combustion, and downhole heat generation have great potential as next-generation thermal recovery methods. "

This micromodel consists of a two-dimensional (2D) pore network etched into a silicon wafer with a bonded glass cover that permits direct visual examination of pore-level displacement mechanisms and pore-network characteristics during fluid flow experiments. The approach began by creating a mosaic of images from a carbonate thin section of a sample with both high porosity and permeability using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) in back-scattered mode (BSE). Connections based on high-pressure mercury injection data were made to ensure that the 2D connectivity in the imaged pore structure was representative of the three dimensional (3D) pore network of the carbonate sample. Microelectronic photolithography techniques were then adapted to create micromodels for subsequent fluid flow experiments. Micromodel surfaces were made oil- or water-wet by various techniques. One of the main advantages of having a representative carbonate dual-porosity micromodel is the ability to observe pore-level mechanisms of multiphase flow and interpret petrophysical properties. Another advantage is that multiple replicates are available with identical conditions for each new experiment. Micromodel utility is demonstrated here through the measurement of porosity, permeability, fluid desaturation patterns, and recovery factors. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Integrated solar thermal steam generation and heavy-oil recovery projects have garnered interest because of their ability to decrease the variability of steam generation costs arising from fluctuations in natural gas prices as well as life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions. The viability of a solar thermal steam generation system (with and without natural gas back-up) for thermal enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) in heavy-oil sands was evaluated in this study. Using the San Joaquin Valley as a case study, the effectiveness of solar TEOR was quantified through reservoir simulation, economic analysis, and life-cycle assessment of oil-recovery operations. Reservoir simulation runs with continuous but variable rate steam injection were compared with a base-case Tulare Sand steamflood project. Reservoir properties and well geometries were drawn from the literature. For equivalent average injection rates, comparable breakthrough times and recovery factors of 65% of the original oil in place were predicted, in agreement with simulations in the literature. Daily cyclic fluctuations in steam injection rate do not greatly impact recovery for this reservoir setting. Oil production rates for a system without natural gas back-up to moderate injection rates do, however, show seasonal variation. Economic viability was established using a discounted cash flow model incorporating historical prices and injection/production volumes from the Kern River oil field. This model assumes that present day steam generation technologies could be implemented fully at TEOR startup for Kern River in 1980, for the sake of comparison against conventional steam generators and cogenerators. All natural gas cogeneration and 100% solar fraction scenarios had the largest and nearly equal net present values (NPV) of $12.54 B and $12.55 B, respectively, with production data from 1984 to 2011. Solar fraction refers to the steam provided by solar steam generation. Given its large capital cost, the 100% solar case shows the greatest sensitivity to discount rate and no sensitivity to natural gas price because it is independent of natural gas. Because there are very little emissions associated with day-to-day operations from the solar thermal system, life-cycle emissions for the solar thermal system are significantly lower than conventional systems even when the embodied energy of the structure is considered. Here, we estimate that less than 1 g of CO2/MJ of refined gasoline results from the TEOR stage of production if solar energy provides all steam. By this assessment, solar thermal based or supplemented steam generation systems for TEOR appear to be a preferred alternative, or supplement, to fully conventional systems using natural gas (or higher carbon content fuels), especially in areas with large solar insolation.

                    "abstract": "Foam as a gas-mobility control agent is successful in enhanced oil recovery processes. An emerging application of foam is to aid surfactant solution delivery for EOR in heterogeneous porous media. In fractured reservoirs, foam acts as a blocking agent slowing and redirecting the transport of the aqueous phase in high transmissibility fractures. Foam aids the imbibition of foamer/surfactant solution into the matrix blocks so that remaining oil is drained. The design of such foam treatments for fractured media is an important factor for economic as well as recovery success. In this work we investigate the behavior of foam flow in fractures at various foam qualities and liquid and gas velocities. Laboratory experiments with different fracture replicates etched in silicon micromodels were used. Micromodels allow real time observations of flow behavior with a microscope and provide a fracture geometry that is easily replicated. A plain smooth fracture with\u00a0 different apertures (40 \u00b5m and 30 \u00b5m), a fracture with variable smooth apertures (either 20 \u00b5m or 40 \u00b5m) arranged in a checkerboard pattern and a constant-aperture fracture with a rough face were used to observe pre-generated foam in terms of texture, pressure drop and flow behavior. Mobility reduction factors for a wide range of foam qualities and flow rates were analyzed. Measured pressure drops increase linearly with an increase in foam quality up to 90%. At qualities greater than 90%, mobility reduction is only slightly reduced further. In general, mobility reduction factors (MRF) of 10-600 times were measured for low to high quality foams, respectively. Additionally video footage of foam at micro and macro scale is used to tie rheology to bubble shape and size. Study results are useful as input for upscaling of the rheology of foam fractures and for ultimate use in reservoir simulations to design effective chemical EOR treatments for fractured media.  Introduction Foam is used in the petroleum industry for production well treatment (Krause et al. 1992) or for gas mobility control during enhanced oil recovery (e.g. Patzek and Koinis, 1990; Ploeg and Duerkesen, 1985). Foam also finds application in aquifer remediation (Hirasaki et al, 1997). The first application causes a decrease in water cut by up to 20% and greater oil rates of 1.5 to 2 times, whereas the latter methods lead to enhanced recovery and better utilization of injection gases. When speaking about production wells, foam is mainly placed subsurface to mitigate gravity override problems. Commonly, foam is useful to mitigate an unfavorable mobility ratio between displacing and displaced fluids. More details about field foam application are given elsewhere (Patzek, 1996; Turta and Singhal, 2002). This work, however, is about foam injection to control mobility and redirect aqueous injectants to unswept zones as for example discussed by Li et al. (2011). The idea behind this application is reduced fluid mobility in fractures or thief zones by injecting foam that aids matrix-fracture transfer of surfactant solution into the matrix blocks. In a sense, this is an application of diversion. Ideally thick conductive fractures that act as thief zones are blocked and fluid flow diverted to smaller fractures and their adjacent matrix blocks. This technique is specifically used for reservoirs that have a thief-zone problem like high-permeability channels or fractures. Foam flow in porous media as well as fractures is still not fully understood. Foam generation and coalescence within fractures are additional critical factors that need to be quantified in order to validate and improve simulation models for such applications. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: We compare different algorithms and boundary conditions for Digital Rock Physics modeling. We report results of Simpleware, Comsol and NIST for elasticity and electrical conductivity and Simpleware and Lattice-Boltzmann for permeability. Overall there is good consistency, though there are sample-to-sample differences. The comparison shows a good agreement between Simpleware and Comsol with a difference of \u02dc1% for effective elastic properties, \u02dc1-3% for permeability and 5% for effective conductivity. The Simpleware Physics Modules allow a streamlined workflow to compute effective properties and is especially suitable for processing a large number of digital samples. Comsol Multiphysics on the other hand allows more multiphysics coupling and access to internal field variables useful for research purposes. The NIST codes for elasticity and electrical conductivity are very efficient but are specifically only for those two physical properties. 1. INTRODUCTION Computation of physical properties on 3-D CT-scanned digital rocks is used in geosciences applications, and a number of different workflows and algorithms have become available. We discuss a comparative study on elasticity and electrical conductivity in different rock types (Figure 1) using Simpleware, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Comsol Multiphysics codes. Permeability is also investigated using Simpleware and Lattice-Boltzmann permeability simulators. The 3D CT-scan images of different rock types are Sandstone (S2), Berea Sandstone, Fontainebleau Sandstone, Carbonate (C1) and Carbonate (C2), as well as digitized version of Finney pack with identical spheres (Figure 1). The materials for the grains and pore-fill assumed for the study were water, quartz, and calcite (for the carbonate rocks), with the following elastic properties and conductivities: 2. VOLUME MESHING 2.1. Simpleware (SW) We import the 3D scan volumes of each sample in Simpleware ScanIP (Synopsys, Mountain View, USA) for image processing and segmentation. Since all of our 3D scan volumes are 100\u00d7100\u00d7100, each stack has 100 images of 100\u00d7100 size. We perform meshing using the Simpleware +FE-Free meshing algorithm with tetrahedral elements. For permeability, the Simpleware Physics Modules +SOLID, +FLOW and +LAPLACE are used with different mesh coarseness Since the rock model is based on a pre-segmented image (a binary image without any greyscale information reflecting the sub-voxel geometry of the sample), it is best to select the \u201cBinarise before smoothing\u201d option. In this way the meshing algorithm in Simpleware does not try to use any spurious greyscale information that might have been introduced into masks by thresholding, and the generated mesh has porosity closer to that of the original image.

According to different distribution scenarios of fault traces and high-stress areas based on in situ characteristics, we build three different spatial statistical models: a no spatial correlation model, an anti-correlation model and a correlation model to analyze and compare with the observed data. By estimating and cross plotting RHA (Ratio of High-stress Areas over total area) and RFL (Ratio of included Fault-trace Length over total fault-trace length) pairs for Monte Carlo realizations of those models, we generate a template to estimate the correlation association between in-panel faults and high-stress areas for the study panel. After comparing the observed cross plots of RHA vs. RFL pairs with the template, we find that the in-panel faults and high-stress areas have positive correlation association and yield an estimate of correlation radius for the study panel. This result is in accordance with previous geological analysis. However, the estimated correlation radius can be affected by velocity artifacts and inaccurate interpreted faults. Considering the influence of velocity artifacts, we achieve a calibrated template to better estimate the correlation radius between in-panel faults and high-stress areas. This estimate could be a practical parameter to optimize mining methods and to minimize stress related rock failures. "

                    "abstract": "Basin and petroleum system modeling is an interdisciplinary endeavor, and utilizes integrated data to study sedimentary basins. Numerical models are constructed and simulated to quantitatively model the geodynamic processes in sedimentary basins. Often, the modeling process covers large spatial and temporal intervals with many uncertain input parameters. These can be continuous parameters characterized by certain statistical distribution, spatially distributed variables, or discrete parameters such as geological scenarios. Identifying sensitivities from these complex input model parameters and recognizing key uncertainties are crucial and challenging for basin modeling development and applications. The major contribution of this work is to introduce and implement efficient and accurate sensitivity analysis approach for basin and petroleum system modeling discipline. We investigated two types of sensitivity analysis methods and compared their performance for identifying the impact of uncertain parameters on both spatial and temporal model responses. The first approach utilizes the variance-based Sobol indices to quantify parameter sensitivities, while the second approach is a distance-based sensitivity analysis which utilizes the distance between model responses to determine sensitivities of different parameters. The sensitivity analysis approaches are illustrated through a basin modeling example involving the processes of sediment compaction, source rock maturation and hydrocarbon generation in the Piceance Basin, Colorado, US. Monte Carlo samples of the input uncertainties related to physical properties of the source rock, thermal boundary conditions, and geological setting scenarios are generated. Multiple basin models constructed using these uncertain input parameters are simulated across the geological time span, and time-varying model response (hydrocarbon generation from Lower Cretaceous to present-day) and spatial model response (pressure and porosity distribution at present-day) are obtained. Sensitive parameters that impact these spatio-temporal model responses are then analyzed. Results show that the distance-based sensitivity analysis approach could achieve similar results with fewer model runs compared to the variance-based Sobol method. Model responses in spatial and temporal domain are impacted by different uncertain input parameters. Subtle relationship between input parameters and model response could also be identified. In particular an unexpected link between chemical kinetics and porosity versus depth behavior was uncovered. The knowledge obtained from sensitivity studies enhance the understanding of the complex geological processes and can benefit the modeling development and forecast capability. Though the sensitivity results are case-specific, the approach and workflow are generally applicable to other basins and earth sciences modeling studies. "

This review explores various approaches to formulate and solve inverse problems in ways that effectively integrate geological concepts with geophysical and hydrogeological data. Modern geostatistical simulation algorithms can produce multiple subsurface realizations that are in agreement with conceptual geological models and statistical rock physics can be used to map these realizations into physical properties that are sensed by the geophysical or hydrogeological data. The inverse problem consists of finding one or an ensemble of such subsurface realizations that are in agreement with the data. The most general inversion frameworks are presently often computationally intractable when applied to large-scale problems and it is necessary to better understand the implications of simplifying (1) the conceptual geological model (e.g., using model compression); (2) the physical forward problem (e.g., using proxy models); and (3) the algorithm used to solve the inverse problem (e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo or local optimization methods) to reach practical and robust solutions given today's computer resources and knowledge. We also highlight the need to not only use geophysical and hydrogeological data for parameter estimation purposes, but also to use them to falsify or corroborate alternative geological scenarios. "

Applications related to seismic amplitude data processing and electromagnetic data acquisition and processing are considered, for reservoir characterization, and resolving drilling and development decisions. We advocate a unified framework integrating statistical and geophysical modeling, and decision analysis. Introduction Making decisions in the petroleum industry can be challenging. There is often notable uncertainty pertinent to the decision and there could be a lot at stake as investments may be considerable and there may be huge financial losses. Reliable geophysical information that resolves some of the uncertainty could go a long way towards improving the overall quality of decisions. What is the value of the geophysical data and how much data is enough? Information almost always comes at a price, so when is the information worth its price? The decision theoretic notion of value of information (VOI) is useful for evaluating and analyzing various sources of data. The power of analyzing information sources using VOI is that: i) it allows the decision maker to perform a reasonable evaluation before the information is purchased and therefore revealed, and ii) if the decision maker can model value using monetary units, then VOI is also in monetary units. Compared with the traditional use of VOI in the petroleum industry, we stress the spatial multivariate aspects of the uncertain reservoir variables, the alternatives, and the potential information gathering schemes. We describe and motivate these spatial characteristics, and conduct VOI analysis for two examples. "

We have identified areas of high vertical stress of an in-situ longwall panel with seismic refraction tomography, and interpreted our results using rock physics models constrained by core measurements. Since P- and S-velocities in rocks are stress sensitive, mapping of them can provide useful information to identify areas of potential high stress. We have inverted P- and S-velocities of main roof of an in situ panel with refraction tomography, and converted them into vertical stress estimates using a calibration function from core measurements. Those estimates are classified into three groups (high, medium, and low), respectively. Identified zones of high vertical stress show qualitative agreement with monitored in-panel microseismic data. Zones derived from P-waves give a more plausible assessment than S-waves. We also discuss the link between high vertical stress areas and in-panel faults. Because of the impact of the regional stress field and previously mined out voids, the existing fault zone affects the redistribution of vertical stress in the underground panel. "

Model parameterization is a key concept to make the inverse problem less ill conditioned. In this contribution we compare the performance of four different basis functions, Fourier, Pixel, Haar and Daubechies Wavelets, for a 1D linear continuous inverse problem. Adopting the right parameterization also reduces the number of dimensions in which the inverse problem is going to be solved, allowing easy posterior analysis. To compare the different basis expansions we have studied a simple 1D linear inverse problem in gravimetric inversion for a density anomaly with Gaussian shape. For this simple toy-problem we show that the Fourier basis gives a better reconstruction using Filon's quadrature to avoid numerical instabilities caused by highly oscillating functions, both, in the noise-free and noisy cases. Besides, the Fourier base is the one that provides the lowest reconstruction error for the number of basis terms and the highest condition number. The Haar and pixel (piecewise-continuous functions) bases provide similar results, although the pixel base needs more terms to achieve lower reconstruction errors. Also, the pixel basis is the one that has the lowest condition number that is obviously related to the way the energy in the system matrix is distributed. Besides, the Daubechies Db2 basis expansion is the one that has the highest system rank, it is more difficult to apply to project the integral kernel, and provides the worst results, compared to the other basis expansions. Finally we propose how to generalize this methodology to linear inverse problems in several dimensions and to non-linear problems. A separate paper will be devoted to this subject. "

We use segmented 3-D images (one for Fontainebleau, three for Berea, three for a carbonate, and one for a sphere pack) to directly compute the absolute permeability, the electrical resistivity, and elastic moduli. The numerical methods tested include a finite-element solver (elastic moduli and electrical conductivity), two finite-difference solvers (elastic moduli and electrical conductivity), a Fourier-based Lippmann-Schwinger solver (elastic moduli), a lattice-Boltzmann solver (hydraulic permeability), and the explicit-jump method (hydraulic permeability and electrical conductivity). The set-ups for these numerical experiments, including the boundary conditions and the total model size, varied as well. The results thus produced vary from each other. For example, the highest computed permeability value may differ from the lowest one by a factor of 1.5. Nevertheless, all these results fall within the ranges consistent with the relevant laboratory data. Our analysis provides the DRP community with a range of possible outcomes which can be expected depending on the solver and its setup. "

The steps of this process include image acquisition, image processing (noise reduction, smoothing, and segmentation); setting up the numerical experiment (object size and resolution as well as the boundary conditions); and numerically solving the field equations. Finally, we need to interpret the solution thus obtained in terms of the desired macroscopic properties. For each of these DRP steps, there is more than one method and implementation. Our goal is to explore and record the variability of the computed effective properties as a function of using different tools and workflows. Such benchmarking is the topic of the two present companion papers. Here, in the first part, we introduce four 3D microstructures, a segmented Fontainebleau sandstone sample (porosity 0.147), a gray-scale Berea sample; a gray-scale Grosmont carbonate sample; and a numerically constructed pack of solid spheres (porosity 0.343). Segmentation of the gray-scale images by three independent teams reveals the uncertainty of this process: the segmented porosity range is between 0.184 and 0.209 for Berea and between 0.195 and 0.271 for the carbonate. The implications of the uncertainty associated with image segmentation are explored in a second paper. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Dynamic data, including production and time lapse seismic can be used in history matching process for better description of the reservoir and thus for better reservoir forecasting. However joint inversion of time lapse seismic and production data is complex and challenging with uncertainties at each step of the process. So it is essential, before proceeding with large scale history matching, to investigate parameter sensitivity for both types of data. In this study the data set of Norne field is used to find out which reservoir rock and fluid parameters have the most impact on time lapse seismic and production data at this field. The result of this study will be used in history matching of time lapse seismic and production data of Norne field.  Introduction Reservoir dynamic data plays an important role in reservoir characterization, management and monitoring. Production data is affected by the petrophysical properties of the reservoir rock. Thus it can be used in history matching process for updating the reservoir model. Time lapse seismic data can provide information on the dynamics of fluids in the reservoir based on the relation between variations of seismic signals and movement of hydrocarbons and changes in formation saturations and pressure. Movement of fluids and changes in pore pressure depends on the petrophysical properties of the reservoir rock. Thus reservoir monitoring by repeated seismic or time lapse surveys can help in reducing the uncertainties attached to reservoir models. Reservoir models, optimally constrained to seismic response as well as flow response can provide a better description of the reservoir and thus a more reliable forecast.  Huang et al., (1997, 1998) formulated the simultaneous matching of production and seismic data as an optimization problem, with updating of model parameters such as porosity. Walker and Lane (2007) presented a case study that included time-lapse seismic data as a part of the production history matching process, and showed how the use of seismic monitoring can improve reservoir prediction. Joint inversion of time lapse seismic and production data requires modeling of seismic as well as production data. These two processes are interrelated and there are uncertainties at each step. Figure 1 describes the workflow of joint inversion of time lapse seismic and production data. The general practice of history matching of time lapse seismic and production data is to update the porosity or/and permeability model till a minimum mismatch between observed and modeled data is achieved. In this process the parameters for reservoir and seismic simulator are considered as fixed. But in reality there are uncertainties attached with these parameters and ignoring them can give misleading results. Thus it is necessary to rank the sensitive parameters both in reservoir simulator and as well as seismic simulator for a better joint inversion of time lapse seismic and production data. This study is inline with the history matching of time lapse seismic and production data of Norne field. Norne field data set is used to identify and rank the sensitive parameters for joint inversion. In future the results of this study will be used in selecting the most important reservoir parameters for joint inversion of time lapse seismic and production data of Norne field. We have performed an experimental design on the parameters of reservoir and seismic simulator. The results are used to rank the parameters in terms of sensitivity to production and seismic data. "

Also, to be able to find a good solution typically involves multiple evaluations of the objective (or cost)\u00a0function. Thus, both a large number of parameters and very costly forward evaluations hamper the use of global algorithms in inverse problems. In this paper, we address the first problem showing that the sampling can be performed in a reduced model space. The reduction of the dimension is accomplished in this case by the principal component analysis computed on a set of scenarios that are built based on prior information using stochastic simulation techniques. The use of a reduced base helps to regularize the inverse problem and to find a set of equivalent models that fit the data within a prescribed tolerance, allowing uncertainty analysis around the minimum misfit solution. We show the application of this idea to a history matching problem of a synthetic oil reservoir, using different members of the PSO family to perform sampling on the reduced model space. "

Each ellipsoidal set arises from a convenient trade-off between size of the ellipsoid and guaranteed exponential convergence rate induced by the corresponding saturated feedback. The first solution is given by a hybrid selection of the MRAW stabilizer, relying on a natural hysteresis switching mechanism. The second solution corresponds to a Lipschitz but non-differentiable scheduled selection, which essentially smoothens out the discontinuous nature of the nested ellipsoids. We discuss the role of our design architecture and establish a number of important properties induced by the proposed controllers. Their effectiveness is comparatively illustrated on a few example studies. "

This model is then extended to account for aging impacts on the TWC. In order to identify the model parameters, a series of ad hoc experiments were designed to test the device over various engine operating conditions. Four TWCs of different ages were tested to investigate the effects of TWC aging on the oxygen storage dynamics. Results show that aging can be lumped within a single model parameter, referred to as oxygen storage capacity. Sensitivity analysis shows only negligible dependence of oxygen storage capacity on catalyst operating temperature. The comprehensive model is validated over real driving conditions for different catalyst ages. The developed model has the potential to enhance the design of optimization-control techniques for fuel consumption benefits and on-board diagnostics health measurement robustness. "

The dynamic, physics-based ORC-WHR system model includes parallel evaporators, flow control valves, a turbine expander, a reservoir, and pumps. The evaporator model contains an enhanced pressure drop model, which calculates pressure drop for each working fluid phase via a linear relation to the axial location inside each phase. The ORC-WHR component models parameters are identified over large range of steady state and transient experimental data, which are collected from an ORC-WHR system on a 13\u00a0L heavy-duty diesel engine. The component models are integrated into an entire system model and the boundary conditions, inputs and outputs for the individual models are described. A GT-POWER\u00ae engine model and its transient validation is presented. The speed and torque profiles of a long-haul, constant speed variable-load heavy-duty cycle are processed through the engine model to produce the exhaust and recirculated exhaust gas transient conditions relevant for the ORC model. The ORC-WHR system then simulated over these highly transient engine conditions. Overall, this paper provides detailed guidelines for ORC-WHR system modeling, model calibration, and component models integration. "

An ORC test rig with parallel evaporators to recover both tailpipe and EGR waste heat from a 13L heavy duty diesel engine was developed and used in this work to demonstrate a novel control strategy based on Model-Predictive Control (MPC). The main control objectives for the ORC system are: (i) regulation of working fluid temperature, (ii) safe turbine operation - away from 2-phase region, and (iii) maximization of waste heat recovery. The MPC uses a built-in moving boundary evaporator model to predict future system response and generate optimal actuator reference commands. Two variants of MPC were considered in this work: an adaptive linear MPC (LMPC) and a nonlinear MPC (NPMC). Compared with the traditionally used PID controller, MPC demonstrates more accurate temperature control and improved disturbance rejection in simulation. Finally, the LMPC and NMPC controllers were implemented on the ORC test rig and showing promising initial test results. "

The aging model is then used to construct the severity factor map, used to characterize relative aging of the battery under different operating conditions. This is used as a battery degradation criterion within a multi-objective optimization problem where battery aging minimization is to be achieved along with fuel consumption minimization. The method proposed is general and can be applied to other battery chemistry as well as different vehicular applications. Finally, simulations conducted using a hybrid electric vehicle simulator show how the two modeling tools developed in this paper, i.e., the severity factor map and the aging model, can be effectively used in a multi-objective optimization problem to predict and control battery degradation.

Using minimum driving information, such as the total trip length and the average cycle speed, the proposed algorithm relies on adaptation of the control parameter from state of charge feedback. The proposed strategy is referred in the paper to as Adaptive-PMP (A-PMP). The new controller is applied to a detailed forward vehicle simulator of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt manufactured by General Motors, where an experimentally validated LG Chem battery model is used. The strategy we propose aims at achieving a blended trajectory of the state of charge to minimize the consumed fuel, resulting in an overall better performance than the actual Charge Depleting/Charge Sustaining (CD/CS) strategy currently used on-board of the vehicle. A comparative analysis of three strategies, i.e., the optimal one (PMP), the proposed one (A-PMP) and the in-vehicle one (CD/CS), is conducted in simulation which shows that improvement above 20% in fuel consumption may be achieved when the proposed algorithm is used instead of the current on-board strategy.

Currently, battery cycle- and calendar-life represents one of the greatest uncertainties in the total life-cycle cost of battery systems. The field of battery aging modeling and prognosis has seen progress with respect to model-based and data-driven approaches to describe the aging of battery cells. However, in real world applications cells are interconnected and aging propagates. The propagation of aging from one cell to others exhibits itself in a reduced battery system life. This paper proposes a control-oriented battery pack model that describes the propagation of aging and its effect on the life span of battery systems. The modeling approach is such that it is able to predict pack aging, thermal, and electrical dynamics under actual PHEV operation, and includes consideration of random variability of the cells, electrical topology and thermal management. The modeling approach is based on the interaction between dynamic system models of the electrical and thermal dynamics, and dynamic models of cell aging. The system-level state-of-health (SOH) is assessed based on knowledge of individual cells SOH, pack electrical topology and voltage equalization approach. "

The paper develops a generic stability and optimality framework within which the energy management problem is cast in the form of a nonlinear optimal regulation (with disturbance rejection) problem and a control Lyapunov function is used to design the control law. Two theorems ensuring optimality and asymptotic stability of the energy management strategy are proposed and proved. The sufficient conditions for optimality and stability are used to derive an analytical expression for the control law as a function of the battery state of charge/state of energy and system parameters. The control law is implemented in a simplified backward vehicle simulator and its performance is evaluated against the global optimal solution obtained from dynamic programming. The strategy performs within 4% of the benchmark solution while guaranteeing optimality and stability for any driving cycle. "

With growing concerns about petroleum usage and greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, finding alternative methods for vehicle propulsion is necessary. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems are viable possibilities for energy converters due to their high efficiencies and zero emissions. It has been shown that the benefits of PEM fuel cell systems can be greatly improved through hybridization. In this work, the challenge of developing an on-board energy management strategy with near-optimal performance is addressed by a two-step process. First, an optimal control based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) is implemented to find the global optimal solution which minimizes fuel consumption, for different drive cycles, with and without grade. The optimal solutions are analyzed in order to aid in development of a practical controller suitable for on-board implementation, in the form of an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) regulator. Simulation results show that the ARMA controller is capable of achieving fuel economy within 3% of the PMP controller while being able to limit the transient demand on the fuel cell system. "

The dynamic modeling of both the PbA battery and the DLC is performed using an equivalent electric circuit approach, which is the best suited for our application. An identification experiment is designed for each device; the PbA battery parameters are estimated at different state of charge (SOC) levels and for the two possible directions of the current. By contrast, the DLC parameters are supposed to be insensitive to those variables, yet they are estimated at different temperatures. The model of the HESS is obtained as the parallel connection of the two models; since our study involves a passive HESS, there is no power electronic interface between the two devices. The outputs of the combined model are the system voltage and the currents flowing in the PbA battery and in the DLC module. A validation experiment is performed on a real HESS, aiming to reproduce the operation of the system in a vehicle equipped with the Start&Stop technology. Good agreement is found between the outputs predicted by the model and the corresponding measurements.

If these excitations correspond to Gaussian white noise, it is relatively straightforward to derive a closed form equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of state variables. Many natural phenomena present however correlated (colored) excitations. For such problems, a full probabilistic characterization through the resolution of a PDF equation can be obtained through two levels of approximations: first, mixed ensemble moments have to be approximated to lead to a closed system of equations and, second, the resulting nonlocal equations should be at least partially localized to ensure computational efficiency. We propose a new semi-local formulation based on a modified large-eddy diffusivity (LED) approach; the formulation retains most of the accuracy of a fully nonlocal approach while presenting the same order of algorithmic complexity as the standard LED approach. The accuracy of the approach is successfully tested against Monte Carlo simulations. "

We investigate how this predictive uncertainty is affected by uncertainty in both the location of the region occupied by a dose-enhancing iodinated contrast agent and the agent's concentration. This is done within the probabilistic framework in which these uncertain parameters are modeled as random variables. We employ the stochastic collocation (SC) method to estimate statistical moments of the deposited energy in terms of statistical moments of the random inputs, and the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to quantify the relative importance of uncertainty in these parameters on the overall predictive uncertainty. A nonlinear radiation\u2013diffusion equation dramatically magnifies the coefficient of variation of the uncertain parameters, yielding a large coefficient of variation for the predicted energy deposition. This demonstrates that accurate prediction of the energy deposition requires a proper treatment of even small parametric uncertainty. Our analysis also reveals that SC outperforms standard Monte Carlo, but its relative efficiency decreases as the number of uncertain parameters increases from one to three. A robust GSA ameliorates this problem by reducing this number. "

The latter employs the reverse Brownian motion (rBm), a Monte Carlo approach that allows one to enforce inhomogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin boundary conditions and is trivially parallelizable. We discuss numerical approaches for improving the accuracy of rBm in the presence of inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and alternative strategies for coupling the rBm solver with its continuum counterpart.

Dissolved solutes and carriers are advected by steady random groundwater flow, which is modeled by Darcy's law with uncertain hydraulic conductivity that is treated as a stationary random space function. We derive general expressions for the spatial moments of the dissolved concentration and the concentration associated with the carrier phase. In order to reduce the computational effort, we use previously derived solutions for the flow field. This enables us to obtain closed-form solutions for the spatial moments of the two concentration fields. The mass and center of gravity of the two propagating plumes depend only on the mean velocity field and chemical/degradation processes. The higher (second and third) moments are affected by the coupling between reactions (sorption/desorption and degradation) among the three phases (i.e., dissolved, carrier and sorbed concentrations) and the aquifer\u2019s heterogeneity. We investigate the potentially enhancing effect of carriers by comparing spatial moments of the two propagating plumes. The forward/backward mass transfer rates between the liquid and carrier phases, and the degradation coefficients are identified as critical parameters. The carrier's role is most prominent when detachment from carrier sites is slow, provided that degradation on the carriers is smaller than that in the liquid phase. "

                    "abstract": "Multiphysics simulations often involve nonlinear components that are driven by internally generated or externally imposed random fluctuations. When used with a domain-decomposition (DD) algorithm, such components have to be coupled in a way that both accurately propagates the noise between the subdomains and lends itself to a stable and cost-effective temporal integration. We develop a conservative DD approach in which tight coupling is obtained by using a Jacobian-free Newton\u2013Krylov (JfNK) method with a generalized minimum residual iterative linear solver. This strategy is tested on a coupled nonlinear diffusion system forced by a truncated Gaussian noise at the boundary. Enforcement of path-wise continuity of the state variable and its flux, as opposed to continuity in the mean, at interfaces between subdomains enables the DD algorithm to correctly propagate boundary fluctuations throughout the computational domain. Reliance on a single Newton iteration (explicit coupling), rather than on the fully converged JfNK (implicit) coupling, may increase the solution error by an order of magnitude. Increase in communication frequency between the DD components reduces the explicit coupling's error, but makes it less efficient than the implicit coupling at comparable error levels for all noise strengths considered. Finally, the DD algorithm with the implicit JfNK coupling resolves temporally-correlated fluctuations of the boundary noise when the correlation time of the latter exceeds some multiple of an appropriately defined characteristic diffusion time.

The pair (u, \u03bb) is estimated by matching in the frequency domain (FD) the theoretical expression of moments pertaining to the breakthrough curve (BTC) against to the one evaluated by means of the experimental data. In particular, we demonstrate that to reduce the impact of the random measurement-errors upon such an estimate, it is worth retaining in the Fourier's expansion of the moments only the harmonics associated to the smaller frequencies. This is due to the fact that the Fourier transform moves most of the measurement-errors affecting moments in the high-frequency range. As a consequence, by adopting a relatively small number of harmonics to compute the Fourier transform of the experimental moments, one may filter out most of the noise. It is also shown that the number of harmonics to retain (cut-off) depends upon the soil's water content as well as the magnitude of the characteristic length \u2113E of the error relative to the dispersivity \u03bb. The proposed methodology has been applied to a recently conducted plot-scale transport experiment. For comparison purposes, we have also estimated the pair (u, \u03bb) by the classical method of moments (MM). Both the methods lead to the same value of the advective velocity u. This is explained by recalling that u depends upon the first-order moment, a quantity that is scarcely influenced by the measurement-errors. Instead, the estimate of the dispersivity \u03bb (which is related to the second-order moment) is largely different (with the value achieved by the MM larger than the one obtained by the FD approach). Such a difference is addressed to the fact that in the MM the distortion-effect due to the measurement-errors amplifies with the increasing order of the moments, a phenomenon which is completely avoided in the FD approach by adopting the above mentioned cut-off.

We present an effective kinetics model of filament formation, bundling, and depolymerization after GTP hydrolysis, which involves a relatively small number of species and reactions, and remains robust over a wide range of concentrations and timescales. We apply this general model to study assembly of FtsZ protein, a basic element in the division process of prokaryotic cells such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, or Caulobacter crescentus. This analysis demonstrates that our model outperforms its counterparts in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Because our model comprises only 17 ordinary differential equations, its computational cost is orders-of-magnitude smaller than the current alternatives consisting of up to 1000 ordinary differential equations. It also provides, to our knowledge, a new insight into the characteristics and functioning of FtsZ proteins at high concentrations. The simplicity and versatility of our model render it a powerful computational tool, which can be used either as a standalone descriptor of other biopolymers\u2019 assembly or as a component in more complete kinetic models.

                    "abstract": "We present a biochemical model of the wall shear stress-induced activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in an endothelial cell. The model includes three key mechanotransducers: mechanosensing ion channels, integrins, and G protein-coupled receptors. The reaction cascade consists of two interconnected parts. The first is rapid activation of calcium, which results in formation of calcium-calmodulin complexes, followed by recruitment of eNOS from caveolae. The second is phosphorylation of eNOS by protein kinases PKC and AKT. The model also includes a negative feedback loop due to inhibition of calcium influx into the cell by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In this feedback, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels cause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can limit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO production by an endothelial cell subjected to a step increase of wall shear stress from zero to a finite physiologically relevant value. Among several experimentally observed features, the model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS activation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid influx of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1\u20135\u00a0min) is followed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.

                    "abstract": "Multiphysics problems often involve components whose macroscopic dynamics is driven by microscopic random fluctuations. The fidelity of simulations of such systems depends on their ability to propagate these random fluctuations throughout a computational domain, including subdomains represented by deterministic solvers. When the constituent processes take place in nonoverlapping subdomains, system behavior can be modeled via a domain-decomposition approach that couples separate components at the interfaces between these subdomains. Its coupling algorithm has to maintain a stable and efficient numerical time integration even at high noise strength. We propose a conservative domain-decomposition algorithm in which tight coupling is achieved by employing either Picard's or Newton's iterative method. Coupled diffusion equations, one of which has a Gaussian white-noise source term, provide a computational testbed for analysis of these two coupling strategies. Fully-converged (\u201cimplicit\u201d) coupling with Newton's method typically outperforms its Picard counterpart, especially at high noise levels. This is because the number of Newton iterations scales linearly with the amplitude of the Gaussian noise, while the number of Picard iterations can scale superlinearly. At large time intervals between two subsequent inter-solver communications, the solution error for single-iteration (\u201cexplicit\u201d) Picard's coupling can be several orders of magnitude higher than that for implicit coupling. Increasing the explicit coupling's communication frequency reduces this difference, but the resulting increase in computational cost can make it less efficient than implicit coupling at similar levels of solution error, depending on the communication frequency of the latter and the noise strength. This trend carries over into higher dimensions, although at high noise strength explicit coupling may be the only computationally viable option. "

Management of such aquifers is an open challenge, because predictive models, on which science-based decisions are to be made, often fail to capture the complexity of relevant natural and anthropogenic processes. Complicating matters further is the sparsity of hydrologic and geochemical data that are required to parameterize spatially distributed models of flow and transport. These limitations often undermine the veracity of modeling predictions and raise the question of their utility. As an alternative, we employ data-driven statistical approaches to investigate the underlying mechanisms of groundwater salinization in low coastal plains. A time-series analysis and auto-regressive moving average models allow us to establish dynamic relations between key hydrogeological variables of interest. The approach is applied to the data collected at the phreatic coastal aquifer of Ravenna, Italy. We show that, even in absence of long time series, this approach succeeds in capturing the behavior of this complex system, and provides the basis for making predictions and decisions. "

An analytical model, which provides such a representation by predicting the dynamics of thermal fields induced by shallow GHEs (ground heat exchangers), is derived. The model accounts for atmospheric temperature fluctuations at the ground surface, an arbitrary geometry of GHEs operating in time-varying heating/cooling modes, and anisotropy and uncertain spatio-temporal variability of thermal conductivity of the ambient soil. To validate the model, its predictions of a thermal field generated by a shallow flat-panel GHEs are compared with experimental data. This comparison demonstrates the model's ability to provide accurate fit-free predictions of soil-temperature fields generated by GHEs. The analysis presented shows that a single horizontal GHE may affect soil temperature by several degrees at distances on the order of 1\u00a0m. The volume of influence is expressed in terms of soil thermal properties. Such modeling predictions are invaluable for screening of potential sites and optimal design of geothermal systems consisting of multiple GHEs. "

Our analysis reveals that the increase of Cu-doping concentration (up to x=0.3) in these powders leads to a gradual increase of the ferromagnetic\u2013paramagnetic transition temperature from 406 to 452\u00a0K. The Banerjee criterion suggests that all the samples considered undergo a second-order phase transition. A modified Arrott plot and scaling analysis indicate that the critical exponents (\u03b2=0.419 and 0.442, \u03b3=1.082 and 1.116 for x=0.0 and 0.1, respectively) are located in between those expected for the 3D-Heisenberg and the mean-field models; the values of \u03b2=0.495 and \u03b3=1.046 for x=0.3 sample are very close to those of the mean-field model. These features reveal the coexistence of the short- and long-range ferromagnetic order in the nanocrystalline Fe2Mn1\u2212xCuxAl powders. Particularly, as the concentration of Cu increases, values of the critical exponent shift towards those of the mean-field model. Such results prove the Cu doping favors establishing a long-range ferromagnetic order. "

The computational cost of higher fidelity models (e.g., molecular dynamics simulations) is invariably higher than that of their lower fidelity counterparts (e.g., a continuum model based on differential equations). While the former might not be suitable for large-scale simulations, the latter are not universally valid. Hybrid algorithms provide a compromise between the computational efficiency of a coarse-scale model and the representational accuracy of a fine-scale description. This is achieved by conducting a fine-scale computation in subdomains where it is absolutely required (e.g., due to a local breakdown of a continuum model) and coupling it with a coarse-scale computation in the rest of a computational domain. We analyze the effects of random fluctuations generated by the fine-scale component of a nonlinear hybrid on the hybrid\u02bcs overall accuracy and stability. Two variants of the time-dependent Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation (GLE) and their discrete representations provided by a nearest-neighbor Ising model serve as a computational testbed. Our analysis shows that coupling these descriptions in a one-dimensional simulation leads to erroneous results. Adding a random source term to the GLE provides accurate prediction of the mean behavior of the quantity of interest (magnetization). It also allows the two GLE variants to correctly capture the strength of the microscale fluctuations. Our work demonstrates the importance of fine-scale noise in hybrid simulations, and suggests the need for replacing an otherwise deterministic coarse-scale component of the hybrid with its stochastic counterpart.

A random flow domain is represented by a stochastic indicator function having a smoothed profile perpendicular to roughness, and the random domain is discretized with a fixed non-conformal grid. This procedure introduces a stochastic force into the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, and modifies the boundary conditions at the fluid\u2013solid interface. We employ a high-order semi-implicit splitting scheme implemented in the context of a spectral/hp element method in order to discretize the physical domain. The stochastic roughness is treated as a second-order autoregressive process that is represented by a Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve expansion. A multi-element probabilistic collocation method is employed to solve the resulting stochastic Navier\u2013Stokes equations. This method is applied to simulate external flow past a rough cylinder and internal Stokes flow between two parallel plates with random wall roughness. In the first problem, we develop an analytical solution for the asymptotic behavior of the lift coefficient CL to verify the results. In the second test-case, we compare the mean and the standard deviation of the velocity field to those obtained from a different method called stochastic mapping approach (SMA), developed by Tartakovsky and Xiu (2006).

Our measurements of single-particle trajectories in cytoplasm and their random-walk interpretations elucidate two of these mechanisms: molecular diffusion in crowded environments and cytoskeletal transport along microtubules. We employed acousto-optic deflector microscopy to map out the three-dimensional trajectories of microspheres migrating in the cytosolic fraction of a cellular extract. Classical Brownian motion (BM), continuous time random walk, and fractional BM were alternatively used to represent these trajectories. The comparison of the experimental and numerical data demonstrates that cytoskeletal transport along microtubules and diffusion in the cytosolic fraction exhibit anomalous (nonFickian) behavior and posses statistically distinct signatures. Among the three random-walk models used, continuous time random walk provides the best representation of diffusion, whereas microtubular transport is accurately modeled with fractional BM. "

                    "abstract": "Modeling of thermal multiphase fluid flow in subsurface porous media poses significant difficulties for nonlinear solvers. These difficulties are a result of the strong coupling between the mass and energy conservation equations through the thermodynamic relationships. In particular, for geothermal problems, this tight coupling results in an apparent \u201cnegative compressibility\u201d for cells (control volumes) that have two fluid phases (liquid and vapor) during the time interval of interest. This behavior is associated with the flow of cold water into a cell that is at saturated conditions. As steam condensation occurs, the reduction in fluid volume due to the phase change is larger than the expansion of the liquid and vapor due to injection. As a result, the cell pressure decreases as condensation proceeds. This pressure decrease leads to an increase in the inflow of cold water until the condensation is complete. During the condensation period, the overall compressibility of the system is negative, and this poses serious convergence problems even when a fully implicit (i.e., backward Euler) time discretization is used. In order to deal with this problem, nonlinear solvers must be modified. In this work, we present a nonlinear solution strategy that overcomes the negative compressibility associated with the condensation front. We first consider a single-cell problem that demonstrates the negative compressibility phenomenon. Then, we describe a solution strategy that overcomes the nonlinear convergence difficulties. We then derive a criterion that can be used as a nonlinear preconditioning strategy to solve multicell problems. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear solution scheme is then demonstrated for more complex models. It was found that for one-dimensional problems, this nonlinear solution strategy converges for all timesteps sizes, while the fully coupled strategy only converges for a limited sized timestep. Furthermore, for a two-dimensional heterogeneous problem, the largest Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) number for this method is at least an order of magnitude larger than the CFL number that can be used with the fully coupled approach.

                    "abstract": "The Sequential Fully Implicit (SFI) method was proposed [12], in the context of a Multiscale Finite Volume (MSFV) formulation, to simulate coupled immiscible multiphase fluid flow in porous media. Later, Lee et al. [15] extended the SFI formulation to the black-oil model, whereby the gas component is allowed to dissolve in the oil phase. Most recently, the SFI approach was extended to fully compositional isothermal displacements by Moncorg\u00e9 et al. [21]. SFI schemes solve the fully coupled system in two steps: (1) Construct and solve the pressure equation (flow problem). (2) Solve the coupled species transport equations for the phase saturations and phase compositions. In SFI, each outer iteration involves this two-step sequence. Experience indicates that complex interphase mass transfer behaviors often lead to large numbers of SFI outer iterations compared with the Fully Implicit (FI) method. Here, we demonstrate that the convergence difficulties are directly related to the treatment of the coupling between the flow and transport problems, and we propose a new SFI variant based on a nonlinear overall-volume balance equation. The first step consists of forming and solving a nonlinear pressure equation, which is a weighted sum of all the component mass conservation equations. A Newton-based scheme is used to iterate out all the pressure dependent nonlinearities in both the accumulation and flux terms of the overall-volume balance equation. The resulting pressure field is used to compute the Darcy phase velocities and the total-velocity. The second step of the new SFI scheme entails introducing the overall-mass density as a degree-of-freedom, and solving the full set of component conservation equations cast in the natural-variables form (i.e., saturations and phase compositions). During the second step, the pressure and the total-velocity fields are fixed. The SFI scheme with a nonlinear pressure extends the SFI approach of Jenny et al. [12] to multi-component compositional processes with interphase mass transfer. The proposed compositional SFI approach employs an overall balance for the pressure equation; however, unlike existing volume-balance Sequential Implicit (SI) schemes [1], [34], [32], [27], [10], [9], which use overall compositions, this SFI formulation is well suited for the natural variables (saturations and phase compositions). We analyze the \u2018splitting errors\u2019 associated with the compositional SFI scheme, and we show how to control these errors in order to converge to the same solution as the Fully Implicit (FI) method. We then demonstrate that the compositional SFI has convergence properties that are very comparable to those of the FI approach. This robust sequential-implicit solution scheme allows for designing numerical methods and linear solvers that are optimized for the sub-problems of flow and transport. The SFI scheme with a nonlinear pressure formulation is well suited for multiscale formulations, and it promises to replace the widely used FI approach for compositional reservoir simulation. "

For highly nonlinear problems, the temporal discretization of choice is often the unconditionally stable fully implicit method. However, the nonlinear systems, often solved with Newton\u2019s method, are difficult to solve. Thus, the computational cost is strongly dependent on the nonlinear convergence rate, and enhancing this convergence property is key to speed up subsurface flow simulation. We focus on the case of spatially discontinuous capillary pressure between rock regions. To efficiently and accurately simulate the flow dynamics in heterogeneous porous media, the flux computation combines Implicit Hybrid Upwinding with transmission conditions between different rock regions. This leads to a scheme that correctly represents the trapping mechanisms while improving the nonlinear convergence. We extend our previous results (Hamon et\u00a0al., 2016 [18]) by generalizing the scheme to fully implicit coupled flow and transport to address realistic problems in multiple dimensions. The generalized scheme is supported by an analysis of its mathematical properties. Our multidimensional numerical examples, which range from buoyancy-driven flow with capillary barriers to viscous-dominated flow, demonstrate that the Implicit Hybrid Upwinding scheme improves the accuracy compared to the standard phase-based upwinding scheme, while leading to significant reductions in the number of nonlinear iterations in multiple dimensions.

                    "abstract": "A novel multiscale method for discrete fracture modeling on unstructured grids (MS-DFM) is developed. To this end, the DFM fine-scale discrete system is constructed using unstructured conforming cells for the matrix with lower-dimensional fracture elements placed at their interfaces. On this unstructured fine grid, MS-DFM imposes independent unstructured coarse grids for the fracture and matrix domains. While the conservative coarse-scale system is solved over these coarse-grid cells, overlapping dual-coarse blocks are also formed in order to provide local supports for the multiscale basis functions. To increase the accuracy, but maintaining the computational efficiency, fracture-matrix coupling is considered only for the basis functions inside the matrix domain. This results in additional (enriching) fracture basis functions in the matrix. By construction, basis functions form the partition of unity for both fracture and matrix sub-domains. Furthermore, to enable error reduction to any desired level, a convergent iterative strategy is developed, where MS-DFM is employed along with a fine-scale smoother in order to resolve low- and high-frequency modes in the error. The performance of MS-DFM is assessed for several 2D and 3D test cases. The proposed method achieves accurate results for several test cases even without iterations, and for challenging ones with only a few iterations. MS-DFM is the first of its kind, and thus extends the application of multiscale methods to unstructured discrete fracture models. As such, it provides a promising framework for real-field application of unstructured DFM. "

These data could be used to compare with cutting edge numerical simulations of the dynamics of snap-off for which experimental and numerical data are lacking.

The optical measures are validated by comparison with both theory and direct numerical simulations. In a constricted capillary tube we observed, both experimentally and numerically, a phenomenon of snap-off coalescence events in the vicinity of the constriction that bring new insights into our understanding and modeling of two-phase flows.

This obviates slow, costly, and discrete fine-scale measurements in favor of a rapid, inexpensive, and continuous mapping approach. It also has implications for mapping thermo-hydro-mechanical properties of organic-rich shales, given that they strongly depend on kerogen content.

We focus on single-phase transport of a passive tracer under advection-dominated regimes and compare PNM with high-fidelity direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a range of micromodel heterogeneities. We identify the minimum requirements for predictive PNM of transport. They are: (a) flow-based network extraction, i.e., discretizing the pore space based on the underlying velocity field, (b) a Lagrangian (particle tracking) simulation framework, and (c) accurate transfer of particles from one pore throat to the next. We develop novel network extraction and particle tracking PNM methods that meet these requirements. Moreover, we show that certain established PNM practices in the literature can result in first-order errors in modeling advection-dominated transport. They include: all Eulerian PNMs, networks extracted based on geometric metrics only, and flux-based nodal transfer probabilities. Preliminary results for a 3D sphere pack are also presented.

The FI method is unconditionally stable, but that comes at the cost of a low-order approximation and high computational cost. The FI method entails iterative linearization and solution of fully-coupled linear systems with mixed elliptic/hyperbolic character. However, in methods that treat the near-elliptic (flow) and hyperbolic (transport) separately, such as multiscale formulations, sequential solution strategies are used to couple the flow (pressures and velocities) and the transport (saturations/compositions). The most common sequential schemes are: the implicit pressure explicit saturation (IMPES), and the sequential fully implicit (SFI) schemes. Problems of practical interest often involve tightly coupled nonlinear interactions between the multiphase flow and the multi-component transport. For such problems, the IMPES approach usually suffers from prohibitively small timesteps in order to obtain stable numerical solutions. The SFI method, on the other hand, does not suffer from a temporal stability limit, but the convergence rate can be extremely slow. This slow convergence rate of SFI can offset the gains obtained from separate and specialized treatments of the flow and transport problems. In this paper, we analyze the nonlinear coupling between flow and transport for compressible, compositional systems with complex interphase mass transfer. We isolate the nonlinear effects related to transmissibility and compressibility from those due to interphase mass transfer, and we propose a modified SFI (m-SFI) method. The new scheme involves enriching the \u2018standard\u2019 pressure equation with coupling between the pressure and the saturations/compositions. The modification resolves the convergence problems associated with SFI and provides a strong basis for using sequential formulations for general-purpose simulation. For a wide parameter range, we show that the proposed m-SFI algorithm is as robust as the FI method with a comparable convergence rate. "

These additional basis functions, constructed in parallel computational platform, aim to resolve large error components for a generic fine-scale system with no right-hand-side term. The design and computational overhead of the enrichment kernels in shared-memory parallel environments are discussed in detail. The robustness and scalability of PEAMS are then illustrated for highly heterogeneous and anisotropic 3D multi-milion-cell reservoir models. The presented results show that, by adding only a few locally- supported complementary basis functions, the convergence of the original multiscale method is significantly enhanced. This is achieved with incurring a marginal overhead in the complexity to the coarse-scale operator. Moreover, in shared-memory parallel environments, it is shown that both of the enrichment procedure and the resulting enriched solver are scalable. Therefore, PEAMS casts a promising framework for robust iterative multiscale formulations for real-field applications, where parallel processing architectures are essential. "

Since the nonlinear behavior of gas injection is sensitive to the resolution of the simulation grid used, it is important to use a fine grid to accurately resolve the gas front and the pressure propagation. Unfortunately, discretizing a compositional flow system with many components on a high-resolution geological model leads to very large and poorly conditioned linear systems, and the high computational cost of solving these systems tends to render field- scale simulations infeasible. An additional challenge is the need for phase-equilibrium calculations, which often represent a large fraction of the computational time when both gas and liquid are present. We present a multiscale solver for compositional three-phase flow problems in which the behavior of the liquid and vapor phases are described by generalized cubic equations of state. The solver relies on a total-mass and overall composition based sequential solution strategy for the flow and transport equations and uses restricted smoothing to compute multiscale basis functions on unstructured grids with general polyhedral cell geometries. The resulting method computes approximate pressure solutions (to within a prescribed residual tolerance) that have conservative fluxes on the reduced computational grid, the original fine-scale grid, or any intermediate partition. The new method is verified against existing compositional simulators on conceptual models and validated on more complex cases represented on both unstructured and corner-point grids with strong heterogeneity, faults, pinched and eroded cells, etc. The resulting implementation is the first demonstrated multiscale method applicable to general compositional problems relevant for the petroleum industry, which includes a cubic equation of state and stratigraphic grids.

For comparison purposes, the same algorithm was also implemented on a shared-memory multi-core architecture. The implementation exploits the parallelism in every module of the original Multigrid algorithm, including both the setup stage and the solution stage, without modifying the original algorithm basic steps. The benefits of this approach are twofold: maintaining the inherent strong linear convergence of the serial Multigrid algorithm, and making advantage of the shared-memory architecture to minimize the need for communication. The design of the algorithm uses a combination of plane relaxation and semicoarsening to efficiently handle anisotropies in 3D, (Dendy et al. 1989). Since the z-direction in most reservoir models is a direction of strong-coupling compared to the x- and y- directions, semicoarsening is employed in the z-direction, and plane relaxation is used for relaxation on x-y planes. Besides the need to solve 2D-systems for plane-relaxation, a set of 2D systems must be also solved on each multigrid level during the setup stage to get an approximate representation of the exact prolongation operator described in Schaffer (1998). For handling both types of 2D systems, a massively parallel version of the 2D Black Box Multigrid (Alcouffe et al. 1981) was designed to handle those 2D solves. To be able to handle problems involving high anisotropies in the x- and y- directions, the 2D Black-Box Multigrid uses alternating line-relaxation with zebra ordering to parallelize across multiple line solves. Due to the inherent granularity difference between the GPU threads and the multi-core threads, line-relaxation was designed to use Thomas Algorithm on the multi-core architecture and Parallel Cyclic Reduction (NVIDIA Corporation 2014b) on the GPU architecture. In both the 3D Semicoarsening Multigrid and the 2D Black-Box Multigrid, V-cycling was used to avoid spending more time at coarser levels and thus affecting the parallel efficiency. To minimize the expensive communication between the host and the GPU (and amongst GPU's), every 2D-solve is explicitly handled by a single GPU. The two versions of the solver were tested using various highly heterogeneous multi-million-cell problems derived from SPE10 Second Dataset Benchmark. For problems with sizes large enough, the GPU implementation, running on KEPLER-Based K40c cards, is found to be always faster than the multi-core implementation running on 12 Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae E5-2620 v2 2.10 GHz cores. In addition, the inherent serial nature of multiplicative multigrid, along with the approach taken to minimize the communication through PCI-e, were found to limit the scalability beyond 3-4 cores/GPU's.

On this fine-scale discrete system, a new algebraic multiscale formulation is developed, which first imposes two sets of coarseand dual-coarse grids. The former grid is essential for conservative multiscale formulations, while the second one is used for the calculation of local multiscale basis functions. The coarse-scale partitioning of the fracture and matrix domains is flexible and totally independent. Moreover, the multiscale basis functions are constructed for both the matrix and fracture domains. By construction, the basis functions are a partition of unity. For 2D and 3D test cases, the performance of the multiscale method is systematically assessed. It is shown that the method (with no multiscale iterations) provides accurate results, even for complex fractured systems.

Flow simulation of compositional systems with high-resolution reservoir models is computationally intensive because of the large number of unknowns and the strong nonlinear interactions. Thus, there is a great need for upscaling methods of compositional processes. The complex multiscale interactions between the phase behavior and the heterogeneities lie at the core of the difficulty in constructing consistent upscaling procedures. We employ a mass-conservative formulation and introduce upscaled phase molar mobility functions for coarse- scale modeling of multiphase flow. These upscaled flow functions account for the sub-grid effects due to the absolute and relative permeabilities variations, as well as the effects of compressibility. Upscaling of the phase behavior is performed as follows. We assume that instantaneous thermodynamic equilibrium is valid on the fine scale, and we derive coarse-scale equations, in which the phase behavior may not necessarily be at equilibrium. The upscaled thermodynamic functions, which represent differences in the component fugacities, are employed to account for the non-equilibrium effects on the coarse scale. We demonstrate that the upscaled phase-behavior functions transform the equilibrium phase space on the fine scale to a region of similar shape, but with tilted tie- lines on the coarse space. The numerical framework uses K-values that depend on the orientation of the tie-lines in the new non-equilibrium phase space and the sign of upscaled thermodynamic functions. The proposed methodology is applied to challenging gas-injection problems with large numbers of components and highly heterogeneous permeability fields. The K-value based coarse-scale operator produces results that are in good agreement with the fine-scale solutions for the quantities of interest, including the component overall compositions and saturation distributions.

We propose a multiscale solution framework for the geomechanical equilibrium problem of heterogeneous porous media based on the finite-element method. After imposing a coarse-scale grid on the given fine-scale problem, the coarse-scale basis functions are obtained by solving local equilibrium problems within coarse elements. These basis functions form the restriction and prolongation operators used to obtain the coarse-scale system for the displacement-vector. Then, a two-stage preconditioner that couples the multiscale system with a smoother is derived for the iterative solution of the fine-scale linear system. Various numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the method. "

The schemes split the interfacial flux into harmonic and transversal components. Specifically, linear combinations of the transversal vector and the co-normal are used that lead to significant improvements in terms of the mesh-locking effects. The harmonic component of the flux is represented using a conventional monotone two-point flux approximation; the component along the parameterized direction is treated nonlinearly to satisfy either positivity of the solution as in [29], or the discrete maximum principle as in [9]. In order to make the method purely cell-centered, we derive a homogenization function that allows for seamless interpolation in the presence of heterogeneity following a strategy similar to [46]. The performance of the new schemes is compared with existing multi-point flux approximation methods [3], [5]. The robustness of the scheme with respect to the mesh-locking problem is demonstrated using several challenging test cases. "

                    "abstract": "To realize the potential of the latest high-performance computing (HPC) architectures for reservoir simulation, scalable linear solvers are necessary. We describe a parallel algebraic multiscale solver (AMS) for the pressure equation of heterogeneous reservoir models. AMS is a two-level algorithm that uses domain decomposition with a localization assumption. In AMS, basis functions, which are local (subdomain) solutions computed during the setup phase, are used to construct the coarse-scale system and grid-transfer operators between the fine and coarse levels. The solution phase is composed of two stages: global and local. The global stage involves solving the coarse-scale system and interpolating the solution to the fine grid. The local stage involves application of a smoother on the fine-scale approximation. The design and implementation of a scalable AMS on multicore and many-core architectures, including the decomposition, memory allocation, data flow, and compute kernels, are described in detail. These adaptations are necessary to obtain good scalability on state-of-the-art HPC systems. The specific methods and parameters, such as the coarsening ratio (Cr), basis-function solver, and relaxation scheme, have significant effects on the asymptotic convergence rate and parallel computational efficiency. The balance between convergence rate and parallel efficiency as a function of\u00a0Cr\u00a0and the local stage parameters is analyzed in detail. The performance of AMS is demonstrated using heterogeneous 3D reservoir models, including geostatistically generated fields and models derived from SPE10 (Christie and Blunt 2001). The problems range in size from several million to 128 million cells. AMS shows excellent behavior for handling fixed-size problems as a function of the number of cores (so-called strong scaling). Specifically, for a 128-million-cell problem, a ninefold speedup is obtained on a single-node 12-core shared-memory architecture (dual-socket multicore Intel Xeon E5-2620-v2), and more than 12-fold on a single-node 20-core shared-memory architecture (dual-socket multicore Intel Xeon E5-2690-v2). These are encouraging results given the limited memory bandwidth that cores can share within a single node, which tends to be the major bottleneck for truly scalable solvers. We also compare the robustness and performance of our method with the parallel system algebraic mutligrid (SAMG) solver (St\u00fcben 2012) from Fraunhofer SCAI. "

To solve the governing partial differential equations, we focus on the fully-implicit (backward-Euler) finite-volume method (FIM). In this numerical scheme, large algebraic systems must be solved at each time step using Newton\u2019s method. This can be quite expensive, especially for highly nonlinear problems with buoyancy. In this work, we present a new first-order approximation of the flux in the FIM leading to improved nonlinear convergence rate and radius. This approximation is based on Implicit Hybrid Upwinding and relies on separate treatments of the viscous and buoyancy parts of the numerical flux. Moreover, in the viscous part, the total velocity discretization is key, as it controls the coupling between the elliptic flow problem and the hyperbolic multiphase transport problem. To achieve robustness and efficiency, we propose a differentiable total velocity discretization that adapts to the balance of forces at each interface. We analyze the theoretical properties of the resulting numerical scheme and prove that saturations remain between physical bounds. Challenging two- and three-phase test cases illustrate that our numerical scheme brings a significant reduction in the number of nonlinear iterations compared to a finite-volume discretization relying on the widely used phase-per-phase upstream weighting. Our numerical scheme therefore reduces the simulation cost while providing similar accuracy. "

Analysis and numerical methods leading to reduced computational cost are presented for the extended system of equations. The accurate representation of the evolution of a discontinuous stochastic solution over time requires a large number of stochastic basis functions. Adaptivity of the stochastic basis to reduce computational cost is challenging in the stochastic Galerkin setting since the change of basis affects the system matrix itself. To achieve adaptivity without adding overhead by rewriting the entire system of equations for every grid cell, we devise a basis reduction method that distinguishes between locally significant and insignificant modes without changing the actual system matrices. Results are presented for problems in one and two spatial dimensions, with varying number of stochastic dimensions. We show how to obtain stochastic velocity fields from realistic permeability fields and demonstrate the performance of the stochastic Galerkin method with local basis reduction. The system of conservation laws is discretized with a finite volume method and we demonstrate numerical convergence to the reference solution obtained through Monte Carlo sampling. "

Because the application of micro-PIV in micromodels is not standard, extensive effort is invested into validation of the experimental technique. The micro-PIV measurements are in very good agreement with numerical simulations of single-phase flows, for which the modeling is well established once the detailed pore geometry is specified and therefore serves as a reference. The experimental setup is then used with confidence to investigate the dynamics of immiscible two-phase flow in micromodels that represent natural complex porous media (e.g., sandstone). For unstable immiscible two-phase flow experiments, micro-PIV measurements indicate that the flow is highly oscillatory long before the arrival of the invading interface. The dynamics are accompanied with abrupt changes of velocity magnitude and flow direction, and interfacial jumps. Following the passage of the front, dissipative events, such as eddies within the aqueous phase, are observed in the micro-PIV results. These observations of complex interface dynamics at the pore scale motivate further measurement of multiphase fluid movement at the sub-pore scale and requisite modeling. "

The framework allows for both fully-coupled and sequentially-coupled formulations. We employ a constitutive model based on \u2018critical state plasticity\u2019. The model accounts for both mechanical hardening and thermal softening due to kerogen conversion. The multi-component, multiphase flow and transport processes of both mass and heat are modeled at the macroscopic (e.g., Darcy) scale. The phase compositions and properties are described by a cubic equation of state; Arrhenius-type chemical reactions are used to represent kerogen conversion. The system of partial differential equations and associated constitutive relations is solved using finite-volume discretization schemes for the ow and transport of heat and mass, and a Galerkin finite-element method is used for the geomechanics. The THM simulation framework is demonstrated for an in-situ retorting problem with a single well. These THM capabilities have been integrated into the Automatic Differentiation based General Purpose Research Simulator (AD-GPRS) being developed at Stanford University. Introduction Oil shale is an organic-rich immature source rock. It consists of heterogeneous mixtures of organic matter (kerogen) and minerals. The mineral-kerogen mixture may appear in finely dispersed form, or in thin laminae (Eseme et al., 2007). The minerals and the organic matter can vary in composition with complex spatial arrangement of the constituents at all scales. Oil shale deposits often take the form of large numbers of thin layers (laminations) that can extend over long (areal) distances. Oil shale rocks are typically hard and brittle at room temperature with pressure dependent mechanical properties. The tensile strength and mechanical moduli of oil shale tend to decrease with increasing organic content. In shallow oil shale deposits, the difference between the in-situ vertical and horizontal stresses can be relatively small. The laminated nature of the deposit usually leads to (macroscopic) anisotropy in the tensile strength, which can be used to induce long fractures oriented nearly horizontally. "

This work focuses on efficient strategies for solving the matrix systems that result from discretization and linearization of the governing equations. These systems have an inherent block structure due to the coupled nature of the mass and momentum balance equations. Recently, several iterative solution schemes have been proposed that exhibit stable and rapid convergence to the coupled solution. These schemes appear distinct, but a unifying feature is that they exploit the block-partitioned nature of the problem to accelerate convergence. This paper analyzes several of these schemes and highlights the fundamental connections that underlie their effectiveness. We begin by focusing on two specific methods: a fully-implicit and a sequential-implicit scheme. In the first approach, the system matrix is treated monolithically, and a Krylov iteration is used to update pressure and displacement unknowns simultaneously. To accelerate convergence, a preconditioning operator is introduced based on an approximate block-factorization of the linear system. Next, we analyze a sequential-implicit scheme based on the fixed-stress split. In this method, one iterates back and forth between updating displacement and pressure unknowns separately until convergence to the coupled solution is reached. We re-interpret this scheme as a block-preconditioned Richardson iteration, and we show that the preconditioning operator is identical to that used within the fully-implicit approach. Rapid convergence in both the Richardson- and Krylov-based methods results from a particular choice for a sparse Schur complement approximation. This analysis leads to a unified framework for developing solution schemes based on approximate block factorizations. Many classic fully-implicit and sequential-implicit schemes are simple sub-cases. The analysis also highlights several new approaches that have not been previously explored. For illustration, we directly compare the performance and robustness of several variants on a benchmark problem. "

For example, multiple pathways between different locations in the porous medium are usually present. The topology, length, and strength of these flow paths can vary significantly, and the total flow at a given location can be the result of contributions from a wide range of pathways between the points of interest. We use a high-resolution pore network of a natural porous formation as an example of the multiscale connectivity of the pore space. A single continuum model can capture the contributions from all the flow paths properly only if the control volume (computational cell) is much larger than the longest pathway. However, depending on the densities and lengths of these long pathways, choosing the appropriate size of the control volume that allows for a single continuum description of the properties, such as conductivity and transmissibility, may conflict with the desire to resolve the flow field properly. To capture the effects of the multiscale pathways on the flow, a non-local continuum model is described. The model can represent non-local effects, for which Darcy\u2019s law is not valid. In the limit where the longest connections are much smaller than the size of the control volume, the model is consistent with Darcy\u2019s law. The non-local model is used to describe the flow in complex pore networks. The pressure distributions obtained from the non-local model are compared with pore-network flow simulations, and the results are in excellent agreement. Importantly, such multiscale flow behaviors cannot be represented using the local Darcy law. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of an Adaptive Algebraic Multiscale Solver for Compressible flow (C-AMS) in heterogeneous porous media. Similar to the recently developed AMS for incompressible (linear) flows (Wang et al., 2014) [19], C-AMS operates by defining primal and dual-coarse blocks on top of the fine-scale grid. These coarse grids facilitate the construction of a conservative (finite volume) coarse-scale system and the computation of local basis functions, respectively. However, unlike the incompressible (elliptic) case, the choice of equations to solve for basis functions in compressible problems is not trivial. Therefore, several basis function formulations (incompressible and compressible, with and without accumulation) are considered in order to construct an efficient multiscale prolongation operator. As for the restriction operator, C-AMS allows for both multiscale finite volume (MSFV) and finite element (MSFE) methods. Finally, in order to resolve high-frequency errors, fine-scale (pre- and post-) smoother stages are employed. In order to reduce computational expense, the C-AMS operators (prolongation, restriction, and smoothers) are updated adaptively. In addition to this, the linear system in the Newton\u2013Raphson loop is infrequently updated. Systematic numerical experiments are performed to determine the effect of the various options, outlined above, on the C-AMS convergence behaviour. An efficient C-AMS strategy for heterogeneous 3D compressible problems is developed based on overall CPU times. Finally, C-AMS is compared against an industrial-grade Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) solver. Results of this comparison illustrate that the C-AMS is quite efficient as a nonlinear solver, even when iterated to machine accuracy. "

                    "abstract": "Nonlinear convergence problems in numerical reservoir simulation can lead to unacceptably large computational time and are often the main impediment to performing simulation studies of large-scale problems. We analyze the nonlinearity of the discrete transport (mass conservation) equation for immiscible, incompressible, two-phase flow in porous media in the presence of viscous, buoyancy, and capillary forces. Although simulation problems are multi-dimensional with large numbers of cells and variables, we find that the essence of the nonlinear behavior can be understood by studying the discretized (numerical) flux function for the interface between two cells. The numerical flux is expressed in terms of the saturations of the two cells. Discontinuities in the first-order derivative of the flux function (referred to as kinks) and inflection lines are identified as the cause of convergence difficulty. These critical features (kinks and inflections) change the curvature of the numerical flux function abruptly, and can lead to overshoots, oscillations, or divergence in Newton iterations. Based on our understanding of the nonlinearity, a nonlinear solver is developed, referred to as the Numerical Trust Region (NTR) solver. The solver is able to guide the Newton iterations safely and efficiently through the different saturation \u2018trust-regions\u2019 delineated by the kinks and inflections. Specifically, overshoots and oscillations that often lead to convergence failure are avoided. Numerical examples demonstrate that our NTR solver has superior convergence performance compared with existing methods. In particular, convergence is achieved for a wide range of timestep sizes and Courant\u2013Friedrichs\u2013Lewy (CFL) numbers spanning several orders of magnitude. In addition, a discretization scheme is proposed for handling heterogeneities in capillary-pressure\u2013saturation relationship. The scheme has less degree of nonlinearity compared with the standard Single-point Phase-based Upstream weighting scheme, leading to an improved nonlinear convergence performance especially when used together with our NTR solver. Our proposed numerical solution strategy that is based on the numerical flux and handles capillarity extends the previous work by Jenny et al.

The large discrepancy in the time- and length-scales between up-dip migration of buoyant supercritical CO2 and the sinking fingers of dissolved CO2 poses a challenge for numerical simulations aimed at describing the fate of the plume. Hence, several investigators have suggested methods to simplify the problem, but to date there has been no reference solution with which these simplified models can be compared. We investigate the full problem of Darcy-based two-phase flow with gravity-current propagation and miscible convective mixing, using high-resolution numerical simulations. We build on recent developments of the Automatic Differentiation - General Purpose Research Simulator (AD-GPRS) at Stanford. The results show a CO2 plume that travels for 5000 years reaching a final distance of 14 km up-dip from the injection site. It takes another 2000 years before the CO2 is completely trapped as residual (40%) and dissolved (60%) CO2. Dissolution causes a significant reduction of the plume speed. While fingers of dissolved CO2 appear under the propagating gravity current, the resident brine does not become fully saturated with CO2 anywhere under the plume. The overall mass transfer of CO2 into the brine under the plume remains practically constant for several thousands of years. These results can be used as a benchmark for verification, or improvements, of simplified (reduced-dimensionality, upscaled) models. Our results indicate that simplified models need to account for: (i) reduced dissolution due to interaction with the plume, and (ii) gradual reduction of the local dissolution rate after the fingers begin to interact with the bottom of the aquifer.

                    "abstract": "Multiphase flow in porous media is described by coupled nonlinear mass conservation laws. For immiscible Darcy flow of multiple fluid phases, whereby capillary effects are negligible, the transport equations in the presence of viscous and buoyancy forces are highly nonlinear and hyperbolic. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow processes in heterogeneous formations requires the development of discretization and solution schemes that are able to handle the complex nonlinear dynamics, especially of the saturation evolution, in a reliable and computationally efficient manner. In reservoir simulation practice, single-point upwinding of the flux across an interface between two control volumes (cells) is performed for each fluid phase, whereby the upstream direction is based on the gradient of the phase-potential (pressure plus gravity head). This upwinding scheme, which we refer to as Phase-Potential Upwinding (PPU), is combined with implicit (backward-Euler) time discretization to obtain a Fully Implicit Method (FIM). Even though FIM suffers from numerical dispersion effects, it is widely used in practice. This is because of its unconditional stability and because it yields conservative, monotone numerical solutions. However, FIM is not unconditionally convergent. The convergence difficulties are particularly pronounced when the different immiscible fluid phases switch between co-current and counter-current states as a function of time, or (Newton) iteration. Whether the multiphase flow across an interface (between two control-volumes) is co-current, or counter-current, depends on the local balance between the viscous and buoyancy forces, and how the balance evolves in time. The sensitivity of PPU to small changes in the (local) pressure distribution exacerbates the problem. The common strategy to deal with these difficulties is to cut the timestep and try again. Here, we propose a Hybrid-Upwinding (HU) scheme for the phase fluxes, then HU is combined with implicit time discretization to yield a fully implicit method. In the HU scheme, the phase flux is divided into two parts based on the driving force. The viscous-driven and buoyancy-driven phase fluxes are upwinded differently. Specifically, the viscous flux, which is always co-current, is upwinded based on the direction of the total-velocity. The buoyancy-driven flux across an interface is always counter-current and is upwinded such that the heavier fluid goes downward and the lighter fluid goes upward. We analyze the properties of the Implicit Hybrid Upwinding (IHU) scheme. It is shown that IHU is locally conservative and produces monotone, physically-consistent numerical solutions. The IHU solutions show numerical diffusion levels that are slightly higher than those for standard FIM (i.e., implicit PPU). The primary advantage of the IHU scheme is that the numerical overall-flux of a fluid phase remains continuous and differentiable as the flow regime changes between co-current and counter-current conditions. This is in contrast to the standard phase-potential upwinding scheme, in which the overall fractional-flow (flux) function is non-differentiable across the boundary between co-current and counter-current flows.

Typical SAGD operations involve a pair of horizontal wells separated vertically. Steam, or a steam-solvent mixture (e.g., Expanding- Solvent SAGD), is injected into the upper well to form a steam chamber and mobilize oil, which drains to the lower production well. Significant mechanical stresses associated with this process can increase the risk of fracturing the reservoir, or cap-rock. We perform a fully-coupled thermal-compositional-mechanical numerical simulation of SAGD and ES-SAGD processes for a typical bitumen reservoir in the Fort McMurray region of Alberta, Canada. A mixed finite-volume approximation for the flow and a Galerkin finite-element approximation for the mechanics are used, and the resulting set of nonlinear equations are solved using a fully implicit formulation. The two discretizations share the same unstructured grid. We demonstrate that thermo-mechanical effects can be quite significant in SAGD operations. The sharper gradients associated with the standard SAGD process increase the risk of damaging of the cap-rock. On the other hand, ES-SAGD operations lead to more dispersed temperature and pressure distributions, which decreases the possibility of damaging the cap-rock. "

                    "abstract": "The history matching problem in reservoir simulation generally does not have a unique solution, and a probabilistic framework - often based on Monte Carlo simulation - is usually employed. This probabilistic data integration process involves the construction of an ensemble of realizations of the Reservoir Characterization Model (RCM), whereby each realization is consistent with (1) the statistical description (e.g., permeability correlation structure) of the RCM, (2) static and dynamic measurements (e.g., permeability, pressure, saturation, production rates), and (3) the governing equations and associated constitutive relations. Even under the strong assumption that the statistical properties of the RCM are known with a high degree of certainty, we will never know the one unique \u2018realization\u2019 that represents the real system, which includes the RCM and the flow performance predictions. Nevertheless, one can quantify the relationship between the Unconditional (U) and Conditional (C) uncertainty spaces - unconditional and conditional refer to pre- and post-history-matching. Here, we discuss the relationship between U and C in the context of Kriging-based inversion employed with the Statistical Moment Equations (SMEs) for flow in heterogeneous reservoirs. Since SME-based Kriging and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) method are identical with respect to model updating (e.g., conditioning the permeability and the porosity fields), the analysis presented here is applicable to both approaches. The inversion process uses measurements to modify (update) U into C. The modification consists of (1) reduction in the size of the uncertainty space and (2) translation, or shift, of the centroid of the distribution. The ratio of the determinants of two covariance matrices is used to compare the relative change in size between two probability distributions. The distance measure is based on the separation between the locations of the distribution centers normalized by their covariance matrices, and it is used as a measure of confidence in U. We prove that the size of C will not increase compared with that of U, and we show that the degree of translation depends on whether the unconditional uncertainty space (U) is a correct representation of the true space. If the assumptions are correct, C will be bounded by U. If the assumptions on U are incorrect, the inversion process will yield a C that is not fully confined within U. For such cases, the computed C (i.e., conditional uncertainty space) should not be accepted, and the input statistical model should be reassessed. We use a simple example with two saturation measurements. The Kriging-based inversion method is then applied in a sequential manner, i.e., one saturation measurement is applied at a time. The result demonstrates that the sequential updating scheme ends up honoring both measurements. This behavior is consistent with the fact that the conditional space (C) is guaranteed to be bounded when the unconditional space (U) is correct. In another example, two pressure measurements are used for conditioning. The two measurements are obtained from two locations that are close to each other. One measurement is high; the other is significantly lower. When the two measurements are taken separately, each measurement is considered to be plausible/realizable for the assumed U. However, when the two measurements are considered together, the distance measure indicates that the probability of occurrence is quite low; thus casting doubt on the correctness of either the measurements or the U. The relative changes in size and distance between distributions provide a self-consistent framework to define the uncertainty space and quantify the relationship between distributions pre and post data integration.
