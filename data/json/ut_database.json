In this study, numerical mechanical tests and digital samples are proposed as an alternative to uniaxial strain experiments for investigating the effects of compaction. We propose a grain crushing model with two-sized subgrains based on the discrete element method and bonded-particle model (DEM-BPM) and perform numerical single grain crushing tests to calibrate the model parameters against the experimental sand grain characteristic strength. Numerical uniaxial strain tests are used to predict porosity and permeability reduction caused by reservoir compaction. Grain crushing incurs a significant reduction of porosity under the uniaxial strain stress path, which becomes more evident for digital samples consisting of larger grains. The stress-dependent changes in porosity and permeability obtained from the DEM simulations can be used as inputs for a reservoir-scale correlation to predict the productivity loss due to reservoir compaction.

The induced mineral-brine-CO2 reactions can alter the reservoir rock strength and deformational behavior, which subsequently affects CO2 storage mechanical integrity. This study attempts to investigate quantitatively the effect of mineral cement and particle dissolution through numerical modeling and validation of triaxial tests performed on unaltered and geologically altered Entrada Sandstone. We utilize a numerical model that couples the discrete element method (DEM) and the bonded-particle model (BPM) to perform simulations of triaxial tests on synthetic rocks that mimic tested rock samples under various confining stresses. Numerical results, in agreement with experimental evidence, show that both cement and particle dissolution significantly contribute to rock weakening in sandstone samples with carbonate/hematite cements and pore-filling carbonate. Sensitivity analyses show that the brittleness of DEM numerical samples is mostly conditioned by the cement bond size among all cement microscopic parameters. An alteration path that mimics the mineral dissolution under subsurface boundary conditions leads to (1) vertical compaction and horizontal stress relaxation in the reservoir rock and (2) transfer of stresses to adjacent strata that results in bond breakage and potentially natural fracture reactivation at a large scale.

                    "abstract": "CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers results in acidification of resident brine. Chemical reactions between acidified brine and rock minerals lead to dissolution and precipitation of minerals at various time scales. Mineral dissolution and precipitation are often neglected in assessing the mechanical integrity of target storage formations, yet, changes in rock strength and deformational behavior can impact trapping mechanisms. This study shows the impact of exposure to CO2-charged brine on shear strength and stiffness of various outcrop rocks evaluated through triaxial testing. The tested rocks were exposed to CO2-charged brine over geological time at a naturally occurring near-surface seepage along the Little Grand Wash Fault and Salt Wash Grabens, which include the Crystal Geyser site near the town of Green River, Utah. Prior work suggests that this site provides a near-surface structural analog for possible fault-controlled CO2 leakage over time scales that exceed expected injection time scales (10–100 years). Results show mechanical alteration in various aspects: (1) CO2-charged brine alteration at near-surface conditions results in mineral dissolution/precipitation and reduction of shear strength and brittleness of Entrada sandstone and Summerville siltstone samples, and (2) carbonate precipitation in fractured Mancos shale leads to matrix stiffening and fracture mineralization resulting in overall stiffer and likely tighter shale. Additional discrete element simulations coupled with a bonded-particle-model confirm the role of cement bond size alteration as one of the main controls for rock chemo-mechanical alteration in sandstones. The chemo-mechanical alteration path that mimics cement dissolution (under stressed subsurface conditions) results in vertical compaction and lateral stress relaxation. Overall, results show that rock exposure to CO2-charged brine can impart distinct petrophysical and geomechanical changes according to rock lithology and location with respect to major CO2 conduits. While mineral dissolution in the storage rock may result in undesired reservoir strains and changes of stresses, mineral precipitation downstream from a leakage path can help seal potentially induced fractures.

                    "abstract": "Six coreflood experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hydrolyzed-polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer solutions on the residual oil saturation (ROS) in Bentheimer-sandstone cores. All six cores were first saturated with brine and then flooded in the following sequence: oil to zero water cut, brine to zero oil cut, glycerin solution to zero oil cut, polymer in low-salinity brine to zero oil cut, and finally polymer in high-salinity brine to zero oil cut. The first polymer solution had approximately the same viscosity as the glycerin solution. The first polymer flood was designed to maximize the effect of viscoelasticity on the ROS by flooding the cores at a high Deborah number (NDe), and, as expected, resulted in a lower ROS. The second polymer flood in high-salinity brine had approximately the same viscosity, but a much lower relaxation time, and the flood had a much lower NDe. Unexpectedly, there was a further substantial reduction in ROS during the second polymer flood. The lowest ROS after the second polymer flood was only 0.07. This is a truly remarkable result, considering that there was no reduction in interfacial tension (IFT), the capillary numbers were maintained below the critical capillary number for Bentheimer sandstone, and the viscosities of both polymer solutions were equal to or less than that of the glycerin solution.

                    "abstract": "The potential leakage of hydrocarbon fluids or carbon dioxide from subsurface formations is a primary concern in wellbore integrity, oil and gas production, and CO2 storage. Leaky wells with fractured cement or debonded microannuli are common sources of subsurface fluid leakage. The hydrocarbon fluid or CO2 can migrate through such pathways to shallower formations and ultimately to surface. Cement fractures may have apertures on the order of microns, which are difficult to seal with typical workover techniques. A material that provides low viscosity during the injection but much higher viscosity after injection, with a minimum pressure gradient to yield flow at the target zone, is a potentially effective approach to seal the leakage pathways through cement fractures. pH-triggered polymers are such a material: aqueous solutions with low viscosity at low pH, containing pH-sensitive microgels which viscosify upon neutralization to become highly swollen gels with substantial yield stress that can block fluid flow. For the wellbore leakage application, the large alkalinity of wellbore cement provides the required neutralization. Our coreflood and rheological experiments show that pH-triggered polymer sealants such as polyacrylic acid polymer provide a robust seal if the process is properly designed; however, its long-term applicability depends on the dynamic geochemical environment of the wellbore. The process comprises three stages: (1) injection of a chelating agent as the preflush to ensure a favorable environment for the polymer gel, (2) injection of polymer solution, and (3) shut-in for the polymer gelation. A systematic study was done to understand the conditions under which the polymer gel remains stable and effectively seals the leakage pathways. A numerical model, based on polymer rheological properties and governing mechanisms observed in the laboratory experiments, was developed to simulate the reactive flow and transport of pH-triggered polymers in narrow fractures. Comparison with experiments shows a generally good agreement, despite the relative simplicity of the model. The numerical model was used to investigate further the underlying mechanisms of the process. The results can be used to design effectively the remediation process for a known fracture aperture size of the target zone. "

                    "abstract": "Many engineering and natural materials, as well as earth systems, exhibit a combination of elastic-plastic and viscous behaviors, but precisely evaluating their rheology, and the micromechanics and chemical-mechanical feedbacks governing such rheology, can be a challenge. The cross-linked polymer Carbopol has long been used to explore fundamental rheological behaviors, most recently including fracturing during viscous creep in nature. Here, through rheometer experiments we establish that Carbopol 940 is, to a first order, a Herschel-Bulkley material. However, we further establish that the yield stress and viscosity are affected by chemically-sensitive micromechanical controls, namely pH and concentration of the polymer mixture. We explore these effects via the novel use of cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Through the SEM imaging we show that there is a semi-quantitative relationship between pH, porosity at the >10-μm scale, and yield stress, a result of the ionic repulsion between polymer links at the molecular scale. We appeal to a model wherein the yield stress is a direct function of jamming expressed at the SEM scale, similar to those described in granular systems. As the pH of polymer dispersion increases, and the porosity decreases, the yield strength increases as a result of the increasingly jammed system. The initial viscosity is thus controlled by the yield stress, but after failure evolves with increasing shear rate due to characteristic unjammed flow of the material. The different controls on the yield stress versus viscous flow rates has implications for borehole engineering efforts (carbon capture and storage) employing Carbopol, and could prove instructive for modeling of natural viscoplastic deformation.

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of solid particles (fines) into a reservoir during drilling or water reinjection is a long-standing problem in the petroleum industry because of the associated production decline or injectivity loss. Solid particle infiltration is also an active area of research in other fields such as waste water treatment and fines migration in clay-rich reservoirs. In this work, we perform experiments to study particle infiltration into sintered glass bead core plugs and measure the changes in porosity and permeability using computed tomography (CT) scanning and pressure transducers, respectively. Suspensions of prescribed bimodal particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs. Permeability changes are measured continuously over time, and the porosity change is measured after flowing a fixed mass of invaded particles. A dual pore-scale numerical model approach (a combination of a direct pore-scale discrete element method (DEM) and a pore-scale network model) is used to predict permeability reduction by particle filtration in porous media. Large particle deposition is modeled using the DEM in a disordered sphere pack geometry; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of large particle concentration. Small particle deposition is modeled using the network model; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of small particle concentration. Crucially, the geometry of the network model depends on the amount of large particles deposited. In this way, the deposition of large and small sized particles is coupled together. The permeability and porosity reduction of the network due to the deposition of small and large particles are then calculated from the functions above. We compare the experimental results with simulation predictions and find that the dual pore-scale model is capable of predicting the permeability of the invaded core in the regions away from the injection face. Permeability prediction in the region adjacent to the injection face is improved by incorporating the influence of the external filter cake. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: CO2 geological sequestration can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The injection of CO2 can alter mechanical properties of the host geological formation due to the interaction between CO2, resident fluid in the pores, and rock minerals. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for such alterations are still not fully understood. This study explores mechanisms of rock alteration due to exposure to CO2-rich brine through the modeling and analysis of micro-scratch tests. The discrete element method (DEM) and bonded-particle model (BPM) are used to perform numerical modeling of the scratch test simulating a sphero-conical stylus scratch on a random packing of bonded spherical grains. The microscopic parameters used in DEM/BPM are calibrated by conducting numerical triaxial compression tests. Numerical results of the scratch test are compared against experimental results on Entrada sandstone. Scratch toughness is correlated positively with the cement bond size, which appears to be the most appropriate parameter to explain the alteration of Entrada sandstone caused by CO2. There appears to be a transition from brittle to ductile failure in the scratch failure mode as the bond size decreases. This work provides insight on how microscopic bond properties alters macroscopic mechanical properties of cemented sandstones. 1. INTRODUCTION CO2 capture and sequestration in deep geologic formations is considered as an economical and environmentally sound approach to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. The injection of CO2 into host formations will shift the subsurface geochemical conditions away from equilibrium. This shift can lead to reactions between rock minerals and CO2-water mixtures (Hovorka et al., 2006, 2013; Bachu et al., 2007; Carroll et al., 2011). The petrophysical and geomechanical properties of reservoir and caprock formations at CO2 storage sites can be significantly altered due to long-term contact with CO2-rich brine (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002; Espinoza et al., 2011; Rinehart et al., 2014; Renard et al., 2008; Rohmer et al., 2016). Chemo-mechanical coupled processes are expected to be triggered by CO2 injection into brine aquifers. For example, chemically aided fracture growth could be a detriment to caprock integrity, facilitating leaks of buoyant CO2. "

                    "abstract": "Shale oil production from plays such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford, driven by advances in horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology, has helped improve US domestic oil production. However, due to the low permeability of shale oil reservoirs, primary depletion only produces 5–10% of the original oil in place and there is a huge potential for improved recovery. Chemical and gas huff-n-puff have been piloted with varying degrees of success, but no breakthrough recovery method has been discovered. This study examines improved oil recovery from shale reservoirs by thermal stimulation, consisting of primary depletion (early in a well's life), followed by conversion of the well to a heat injector to elevate reservoir temperature, and finally followed by a secondary depletion. The proposed method was tested using a compositional, thermal reservoir simulator (CMG STARS) and key parameters affecting recovery during thermal stimulation were investigated. This study found that 1000 days of thermal stimulation with a 700 °F heater has the potential to economically increase oil recovery from about 7% to more than 11.5%, with potential for even greater recovery if heat injection time and temperature are optimized. The study also found that thermal pressurization of oil is the primary mechanism for the improved recovery. Kerogen decomposition into oil and gas results in a significant increase of hydrocarbons in place but is only a minor contribution to the additional recovery because production is limited by a lack of flow capacity. Furthermore, a two-fold increase in permeability is observed as a result of kerogen decomposition, but its contribution to recovery is also minor because the heated region is not well connected with the fractured region. The heating scheme may be improved in the future to better connect the heated region with the fractured region. "

Compositional reservoir modeling was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed gas injection scheme. The computational domain consists of two hydrofrac half-stages along a horizontal well. The results show 15.7% and 12.5% OOIP incremental recovery over 5000 days of CO2 injection for the base models with the matrix permeability of 10 μD and 1 μD, respectively, demonstrating that the gas injection scheme has the potential to vastly improve oil recovery in oil-rich shale formations. The effects of reservoir properties and injection conditions on oil recovery were investigated by changing the injection pressure, reservoir heterogeneity, distribution of natural fractures, hydrofrac spacing, size of pore space, and compositions of the injection gas. Most of them affect the oil recovery significantly. Recovery by miscible hydrocarbon gas injection is comparable to CO2; so it should be considered as an alternative. "

Stability and rheology of the flowing emulsion in porous media are key factors for the effectiveness of the EOR method. The objective of this study is to use microfluidics to (1) quantitatively evaluate the synergistic effect of surfactants and NPs on emulsion dynamic stability and how NPs affect the emulsion properties, and to (2) investigate how emulsion properties affect the sweep performance in emulsion flooding. A microfluidic device with well-defined channel geometry of a high-permeability pathway and multiple parallel low-permeability pathways was created to represent a fracture/matrix dual-permeability system. Measurement of droplet coalescence frequency during flow is used to quantify the dynamic stability of emulsions. An NP aqueous suspension (2 wt%) shows excellent ability to stabilize the macro-emulsion when mixed with a trace amount of surfactant (0.05 wt%), revealing a synergistic effect between NPs and surfactant. For a stable emulsion, when a pore throat is present in the high-permeability pathway, it was observed that flowing emulsion droplets compress each other and then block the high-permeability pathway at a throat structure, which forces the wetting phase into low-permeability pathways. Droplet size shows little correlation with this blocking effect. Water content was observed to be much higher in the low-permeability pathways than in the high-permeability pathways, indicating different emulsion texture and viscosity in channels of different sizes. Consequently, the assumption of bulk emulsion viscosity in the porous medium is not applicable in the description and modeling of the emulsion-flooding process. Flow of emulsions stabilized by an NP/surfactant mixture shows droplet packing in high-permeability regions that is denser than those stabilized by surfactant only, at high-permeability regions, which is attributed to the enhanced interaction between droplets caused by NPs in the thin liquid film between neighboring oil/water (O/W) interfaces. This effect is shown to enhance the performance of emulsion-blockage effect for sweep-efficiency improvement, showing the advantage of NPs as an emulsion stabilizer during an emulsion-based EOR process.

The objective of this work is to investigate the effect of viscoelastic polymers on ROS in Bentheimer sandstones and identify conditions and mechanisms for the improved recovery. Bentheimer sandstones were saturated with a heavy oil (120 cp) and then waterflooded to ROS with brine followed by an inelastic Newtonian fluid (diluted glycerin). These floods were followed by injection of a viscoelastic polymer, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). Significant reduction in residual oil was observed for all corefloods performed at constant pressure drop when the polymer had significant elasticity (determined by the dimensionless Deborah number, NDe). An average residual-oil reduction of 5% original oil in place (OOIP) was found during HPAM polymer floods for NDe of 0.6 to 25. HPAM floods with very-low elasticity (NDe < 0.6) did not result in observable reduction in ROS; however, another 10% OOIP residual oil was reduced when the flow rate was increased (NDe > 25). All experiments at constant pressure drop indicate that polymer viscoelasticity reduces the ROS. Results from CT scans further support these observations. A correlation between Deborah number and ROS is also presented. "

                    "abstract": "Multistage hydraulic fracturing, together with horizontal drilling, plays an important role in the economic development of unconventional reservoirs. However, according to field analysis of stimulation effectiveness, only a small percentage of perforation clusters contribute to most of the well production. One reason for this low effectiveness is that multiple fractures do not take the same amount of fluid and proppant because of the interaction between hydraulic fractures (i.e., stress-shadow effects). Unfortunately, how best to minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing is still not fully understood in the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyze this problem to promote more-uniform fracture growth by use of a complex hydraulic-fracture-development model. We use our fracture-propagation model, which couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. The model assumes homogeneous linear-elastic rock medium and does not consider proppant transport in multiple fractures. Partitioning of flow rate between multiple fractures is calculated by use of the principles of flow through an electric-circuit network. Fracture development is dominated by flow-rate distribution, which is controlled by flow resistance within the fractures. For simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation, nonuniform flow-rate distribution is induced because stress-shadow effects exert additional flow resistance on the interior fractures. To balance the extra resistance introduced by the effects, we investigated two adjustment approaches to promote uniform fracture development. The first approach was to adjust perforation number or diameter to increase flow resistance entering the exterior fractures. The second was to mitigate stress-shadow effects through management of nonuniform fracture spacing. We found that decreasing perforation diameter or the number of exterior fractures can divert fluid into the interior fractures and promote even fracture growth. Stress-shadow effects can be mitigated by moving the two interior fractures away from each other and toward the exterior fractures. The key mechanism is to maintain even flow resistance within each fracture and facilitate fractures to obtain the same amount of injection fluid. Furthermore, flow resistance is affected by near-wellbore fracture tortuosity, natural fractures, and stress heterogeneity in the reservoirs. These factors might also be effectively controlled by adding extra flow resistance to pass perforations, provided that this extra resistance is larger than the extra resistance introduced by the factors. This work analyzes the problem of uneven development of multiple fractures along the horizontal wellbore and provides new insights into how to control simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation. It offers potential approaches for engineers to apply in the field to optimize hydraulic-fracturing-treatment design, thereby maximizing well production cost-effectively. "

                    "abstract": "Multiple numerical approaches have been developed to simulate porous media fluid flow and solute transport at the pore scale. These include 1) methods that explicitly model the three-dimensional geometry of pore spaces and 2) methods that conceptualize the pore space as a topologically consistent set of stylized pore bodies and pore throats. In previous work we validated a model of the first type, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes employing a standard finite volume method (FVM), against magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) measurements of pore-scale velocities. Here we expand that validation to include additional models of the first type based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), as well as a model of the second type, a pore-network model (PNM). The PNM approach used in the current study was recently improved and demonstrated to accurately simulate solute transport in a two-dimensional experiment. While the PNM approach is computationally much less demanding than direct numerical simulation methods, the effect of conceptualizing complex three-dimensional pore geometries on solute transport in the manner of PNMs has not been fully determined. We apply all four approaches (FVM-based CFD, LBM, SPH and PNM) to simulate pore-scale velocity distributions and (for capable codes) nonreactive solute transport, and intercompare the model results. Comparisons are drawn both in terms of macroscopic variables (e.g., permeability, solute breakthrough curves) and microscopic variables (e.g., local velocities and concentrations). Generally good agreement was achieved among the various approaches, but some differences were observed depending on the model context. The intercomparison work was challenging because of variable capabilities of the codes, and inspired some code enhancements to allow consistent comparison of flow and transport simulations across the full suite of methods. This study provides support for confidence in a variety of pore-scale modeling methods and motivates further development and application of pore-scale simulation methods. "

                    "abstract": "Recent research indicates that even small viscous transverse pressure gradients can increase the rate of surfactant imbibition into the matrix of a fractured reservoir. However, surfactants are commonly tested using static imbibition cells without any imposed pressure gradient. Therefore, the effect of viscous pressure gradients was investigated by conducting a series of surfactant corefloods using fractured Silurian Dolomite and Texas Cream Limestone cores. The viscosity of the surfactant solution was increased by adding polymer or by changing the salinity of the aqueous surfactant solution, which affects the in-situ microemulsion viscosity. The fractured cores had a permeability contrast between the fracture and the matrix ranging from 2500 to 90,000. Non-fractured corefloods were also performed and compared with the fractured corefloods. The more viscous surfactant solutions achieved greater oil recovery from the fractured carbonate cores. These results indicate that a viscous microemulsion can serve as a mobility control agent in naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) that is analogous to mobility control with foams and polymers, but with less complexity and cost.

                    "abstract": "Shales and other unconventional or low permeability (tight) reservoirs house vast quantities of hydrocarbons, often demonstrate considerable water uptake, and are potential repositories for fluid sequestration. The pore-scale topology and fluid transport mechanisms within these nanoporous sedimentary rocks remain to be fully understood. Image-informed pore-scale models are useful tools for studying porous media: a debated question in shale pore-scale petrophysics is whether there is a representative elementary volume (REV) for shale models? Furthermore, if an REV exists, how does it differ among petrophysical properties? We obtain three dimensional (3D) models of the topology of microscale shale volumes from image analysis of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) image stacks and investigate the utility of these models as a potential REV for shale. The scope of data used in this work includes multiple local groups of neighboring FIB-SEM images of different microscale sizes, corresponding core-scale (milli- and centimeters) laboratory data, and, for comparison, series of two-dimensional (2D) cross sections from broad ion beam SEM images (BIB-SEM), which capture a larger microscale field of view than the FIB-SEM images; this array of data is larger than the majority of investigations with FIB-SEM-derived microscale models of shale. Properties such as porosity, organic matter content, and pore connectivity are extracted from each model. Assessments of permeability with single phase, pressure-driven flow simulations are performed in the connected pore space of the models using the lattice-Boltzmann method. Calculated petrophysical properties are compared to those of neighboring FIB-SEM images and to core-scale measurements of the sample associated with the FIB-SEM sites. Results indicate that FIB-SEM images below ∼5000 µm3 volume (the largest volume analyzed) are not a suitable REV for shale permeability and pore-scale networks; i.e. field of view is compromised at the expense of detailed, but often unconnected, nanopore morphology. Further, we find that it is necessary to acquire several local FIB-SEM or BIB-SEM images and correlate their extracted geometric properties to improve the likelihood of achieving representative values of porosity and organic matter volume. Our work indicates that FIB-SEM images of microscale volumes of shale are a qualitative tool for petrophysical and transport analysis. Finally, we offer alternatives for quantitative pore-scale assessments of shale. "

                    "abstract": "Injecting oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions stabilized with nanoparticles or surfactants is a promising option for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in harsh-condition reservoirs. Stability and rheology of flowing emulsion in porous media are key factors for the effectiveness of the EOR method. The objective of this study is to use microfluidics to (1) quantitatively evaluate the synergistic effect of surfactants and nanoparticles on emulsion's dynamic stability and how nanoparticles affects the emulsion properties, and (2) investigate how emulsion properties affect the sweep performance in emulsion flooding. A microfluidic device with well-defined channel geometry of a high-permeability pathway and multiple parallel low-permeability pathways was created to represent a fracture – matrix dual-permeability system. Measurement of droplets’ coalescence frequency during flow is used to quantify the dynamic stability of emulsions. A nanoparticle aqueous suspension (2 wt%) shows excellent ability to stabilize macro-emulsion when mixed with trace amount of surfactant (0.05 wt%), revealing a synergic effect between nanoparticles and surfactant. For a stable emulsion, it was observed that flowing emulsion droplets compress each other and then block the high-permeability pathway at a throat structure, which forces the wetting phase into low-permeability pathways. Droplet size shows little correlation with this blocking effect. Water content was observed much higher in the low-permeability pathways than in the high-permeability pathway, indicating different emulsion texture and viscosity in channels of different sizes. Consequently, the assumption of bulk emulsion viscosity in the porous medium is not applicable in the description and modeling of emulsion flooding process. Flow of emulsions stabilized by the nanoparticle-surfactant synergy shows droplet packing mode different from those stabilized by surfactant only at high local oil saturation region, which is attributed to the interaction among nanoparticles in the thin liquid film between neighboring oil-water interfaces. This effect is believed to be an important contributing mechanism for sweep efficiency attainable from nanoparticle-stabilized emulsion EOR process. "

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe efforts to create a computationally efficient model that is accurate for multiple, three dimensional fracture problems. The accuracy of a fast pseudo-3D method (Olson, 2004) for describing fracture interaction is investigated through comparing with a fully 3D displacement discontinuity method (DDM). Results demonstrate that the pseudo- 3D solution underestimates the mechanical interaction between nearby fractures. The apertures of both interior and exterior fractures given by the pseudo-3D method are larger than the fully 3D solutions. However, 3D DDM is computationally far more expensive than the pseudo-3D method because a) more elements are required to describe a fracture in three dimensions and b) the computational cost per element is higher in 3D. We show that using 1 element in the fracture height direction with the standard 3D equations is unacceptably inaccurate, but by employing an analytically based correction factor, that accuracy can be significantly improved, eliminating the need for extra elements for height-contained hydraulic fracture problems. The higher per element computation cost in 3D is largely the result of the fact that the 3D displacement discontinuity method has three unknowns (opening, strike-slip shear and dip-slip shear). Further speed advantage is gained by dictating all fractures must be vertical, which allows elimination of equation components related to the dip-slip shear. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to problems of multiple hydraulic fracture propagation in horizontal wells. 1. INTRODUCTION In recent years, production of tight oil and shale gas has increased exponentially in the United States. Multiple fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional reservoirs. A better understanding of multiple fracture growth is essential for accurately predicting fracture geometry. Mechanical interaction between multiple fractures, also referred to as stress shadow effects, is a critical factor controlling fracture geometry and inducing complex fracture geometry. To better model fracture interaction, an efficient and accuracy method is required. "

                    "abstract": "Miscible gas injection is proposed here for improved oil recovery in unconventional, oil-rich shale reservoirs. The ultra-low permeability of shale makes injection from well to well difficult; thus it is proposed that gas is injected into a hydraulic fracture along a horizontal well and production occurs from an adjacent fracture, intersecting the same well. Compositional reservoir modeling was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed gas injection scheme. The computational domain consists of two hydrofrac half-stages along a horizontal well to capture detailed information of the fluid flow near the well bore. The results show 15.7% OOIP incremental recovery for the base model with matrix permeability kmatrix = 10 µD over 5000 days (nearly 14 years) of CO2 injection, and 12.5% OOIP for the one with kmatrix = 1 µD, indicating that the gas injection scheme has the potential to vastly improve oil recovery in oil-rich shale formations. The effects of reservoir properties and injection conditions on oil recovery were investigated by changing the injection pressure, reservoir heterogeneity, hydrofrac spacing, dispersion, and compositions of the injection gas. Increasing injection pressure leads to higher production before breakthrough and faster recovery of the oil in the stimulated region. Reducing the hydrofrac spacing has similar effect, although the production declines more rapidly after breakthrough. Introducing heterogeneity to the reservoir results in lower recovery, but the effect of spatial continuity (correlation length) on recovery is insignificant. It was also found that dispersion is mainly dominated by diffusion and mechanical dispersion is less important in most cases. Injection of hydrocarbon gas outperforms CO2, especially if the economics is also taken into account. "

Huff-and-Puff is an enhanced oil recovery method in which a well alternates between injection, soaking, and production. Injecting CO2 (or other gases) into the formation and allowing it to “soak” re-pressurizes the reservoir and improves oil mobility, boosting production from the well. A compositional reservoir simulator (CMG GEM) was used to study various design components of the Huff-and-Puff process in order to identify the parameters with the largest impact on recovery and understand the reservoir’s response to cyclical gas injection. It was found that starting Huff-and-Puff too early in the life of the well diminishes its effectiveness, and that shorter soaking periods are preferable over longer waiting times. Huff-and-Puff works best in reservoirs with highly-conductive natural fracture networks, which allow CO2 to migrate deep into the formation and mix with the reservoir fluids. Doubling the number of hydraulic fractures per stage results in considerably greater gas injection requirements without proportionally larger incremental recovery factors. Incremental recovery from CO2 Huff-and-Puff appears to be insufficient to make the process commercially feasible under current economic conditions. However, re-injecting mixtures of CO2 and produced hydrocarbon gases was shown to be technically and economically viable, and could significantly improve profit margins of Huff-and-Puff operations.

The solution allows for general radial- and time-dependent inlet/outlet conditions, complex boundary conditions on the duct wall including adsorption and decay, and arbitrary velocity profiles of the transporting fluid. The only numerical step of the solution is the inverse Laplace transform in the time variable. Therefore, the approach also produces fully analytical steady-state solutions. The solution is verified against computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under various boundary conditions and velocity profiles (Newtonian and power-law), and in all cases good agreement is obtained. Although theoretically applicable to all regimes, the solution is computationally difficult at very high Peclet numbers and very early times due to numerical instabilities as a result of finite precision arithmetic of computers. A convergence analysis is conducted to delineate the boundaries of this limit for two important cases. The solution was derived using a new approach for solving two-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) with non-constant coefficients which parallels the Frobenius and power series methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach reduces the original PDE to a single infinite-order ODE with constant coefficients. The approach is suspected to provide solutions to a large class of PDEs of this type. The solution may find applications in a number of engineering and/or biomedical fields, it can be used to verify numerical simulators, and serve as a simple and easy-to-implement alternative where access to numerical simulators is not available.

                    "abstract": "An equation-of-state (EOS) -based compositional reservoir simulator, UT-COMP, is used to simulate both primary recovery and carbon dioxide (CO2) huff 'n' puff recovery in a shale matrix typical of the Bakken formation, to investigate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on hydrocarbon recovery. Nonaqueous components are carefully lumped into seven pseudocomponents. Permeability fields with various heterogeneity and correlation lengths are generated. UT-COMP is able to solve the compositional model, despite the permeability difference between the fracture and matrix being six orders of magnitude. The effects of both primary recovery and CO2 huff 'n' puff recovery depend significantly on reservoir heterogeneity. In primary recovery, the recovery factor can be fit by a two-parameter exponential formula; higher heterogeneity reduces the rate coefficient in the formula. Permeability fields with identical or similar heterogeneity have similar rate coefficients, even if the correlation lengths are different, which implies that the recovery depends primarily on heterogeneity and is insensitive to correlation length. Multiple-cycle CO2 huff 'n' puff processes are simulated in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. Recovery rate in the production stage rises to a peak value much higher than that in the primary recovery, and then declines dramatically. The peak recovery rate decreases with increasing huff 'n' puff cycles, resulting from depleted reservoir pressure and hydrocarbons. The final recovery factor in the huff 'n' puff recovery is lower than that in the primary recovery, because the incremental recovery in the production stage is unable to compensate the loss in the injection and shut-in stages. Use of a longer shut-in time does not help increase the recovery rate in the production stage, because CO2 migration into the shale matrix is very limited because of the low matrix permeability. Reservoir heterogeneity leads to a faster decline of recovery rate in the production stage. "

Polymers such as hydroxypolyacrylamide (HPAM) are used to improve sweep efficiency in reservoirs and these polymers often exhibit elasticity.  Surprisingly, recent experimental and field observations indicate that these viscoelastic polymers improve oil recovery up to an additional 20%, contrary to the conventional wisdom that polymers should have no impact on residual oil saturation.  Here, we attaempt to understand effects of viscoelasticity on residual saturation in water-wet and mixed-wet porous media. Static and dynamic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of oil droplets in the presence of viscoelastic polymer are conducted in geometries representative of pore throats. Results show that additional forces on the oil droplet are present for fluids that exhibit elasticity over those that do not (e.g. water) and those forces become larger as the oil droplet approaches a constriction. It is also shown using dynamic simulations that the amount of deformation of the oil droplet is greatly affected by the elasticity of the displacing fluid. These results are promising and provide a theoretical foundation for the laboratory and field observations of reduced residual oil. "

                    "abstract": "An equation-of-state based compositional reservoir simulator, UT-COMP, is used to simulate the improved oil recovery by CO2 huff-n-puff in a shale matrix typical of the Bakken Formation. Non-aqueous components are carefully lumped into seven pseudo components. Permeability fields with various heterogeneity and correlation lengths are generated. UT-COMP is able to solve the compositional model, despite the permeability difference between the fracture and matrix being six orders of magnitude. Multiple cycles of CO2 huff-n-puff are simulated and compared with production by primary depressurization. The oil is first contact miscible with the injected CO2 under the reservoir pressure. Simulations show that primary recovery outperforms CO2 huff-n-puff in an ideally homogenous reservoir because injected CO2 moves deep into the reservoir without much increase in near-well pressure, while CO2 huff-n-puff outperforms primary recovery if there exists a low-permeability region which keeps CO2 in the near-well bore injection region. In the latter case, the final recovery using CO2 huff-n-puff is higher than that from primary depressurization; the recovery in a single cycle is about 3.3%, which increases to 3.5% in about 3 cycles. The recovery factor after 1000 days by primary depressurization with production pressure of 1000 psi is 11.6%, which is in agreement with existing studies. The recovery increase can be fit by a two-parameter exponential function and the rate coefficient is found to be insensitive to correlation length, while depends mainly on reservoir heterogeneity. A linear relationship between heterogeneity and rate coefficient is obtained. This work is the first to investigate the effect of heterogeneity on improved hydrocarbon recovery by CO2 huff-n-puff, and will be valuable in understanding the coupling between shale properties and oil recovery. 1. Introduction The consumption of petroleum hydrocarbons in the world has steadily increased during the past decades. To meet the rising demand for energy resources, production of unconventional hydrocarbons, such as shale oil and gas, has attracted great attention. The Bakken Formation in Williston Basin covers parts of Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and is estimated to contain 100 billion barrels of oil (Clarkson & Pederson, 2011). As a part of the Bakken Formation, the Elm Coulee Field located in Richland County, Montana is estimated to have 3.65 billion barrels of oil, and 1.85 trillion cubic feet of gas (Pollastro et al., 2008). The Bakken Formation underlies Lower Missisipian Lodgepole formation and overlies the Upper Devonian Three Forks Formation at the depth of about 10,000 ft. The formation has 3 distinct layers: Missisipian upper shale, Devonian middle dolomite, and Devonian lower shale. The upper shale is organic rich pyritic shale of about 8-12 feet thick. The organic content is up to 40%. It is the source rock for the Bakken formation. It is naturally fractured in some small parts of the reservoir with an effective permeability of a few millidarcy (Shoaib and Hoffman, 2009); in other parts the permeability is much lower. The middle dolomite is the main reservoir facie consisting of silty and sandy dolomite. This layer is 7-15 feet thick with porosity of 6-8% and permeability of 10-40 microdarcy. The lower shale is a brownish, noncalcerous, organic mudstone with an organic content of up to 21%. It is about 0-6 feet thick and very tight. The oil has an API gravity of 42. "

The observed reduction contradicts decades of belief that polymers could not be used to reduce residual oil because the additional pressure required to overcome capillary pressure is orders of magnitude greater than provided by the more viscous polymer. However, additional forces (such as normal stress forces) may be significant for viscoelastic fluids that are ignored in analysis of purely viscous fluids. We perform computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) simulations of viscoelastic flow around static oil droplets in geometries representative of pore throats. We show that normal forces are significant for viscoelastic fluids and increase with De and the total force imposed on the droplet may be larger than an equivalent Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity. Results indicate that normal forces could dominate and the total, effective force would be enough to mobilize trapped oil. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In mechanistic modeling of foam in porous media, reduced gas mobility is attributed to viscous resistance of flowing foam lamellas to gas flow, while gas trapping significantly modifies relative permeability. By using pore-network models representative of real porous media, we previously developed a relationship between flowing gas fraction and pressure gradient for strong foam (high lamella density). In this study, we expand our model to describe the effects of foam strength and pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models on both relative gas permeability and effective gas viscosity. Dimensional analysis in scaling of these two rheological quantities with pressure gradient and lamella density is discussed.  One of our important findings is that relative gas permeability is poorly sensitive to total lamella density while it is a strong non-linear function of flowing gas fraction, opposing to most of the existing theoretical models describing the effect of gas trapping on relative gas permeability. This is consistently observed for all the pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models. It is also found that effective gas viscosity increases exponentially with flowing lamella density. This result implies that the use of the commonly used apparent gas viscosity model for straight capillary tubes is not accurate for foam flow in porous media.  In addition, shear thinning foam flow is more obvious at high flowing lamella density while Newtonian flow becomes significant at relatively low flowing lamella density. Furthermore, scaling of effective gas viscosity with flowing lamella density depends on how the later quantity is defined. Both empirical and mechanistic pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models give almost the same functional relationship between flowing gas fraction and pressure gradient. This would facilitate scaling of flow rate with pressure gradient and testing a range of shear-thinning and yield-stress behavior in a simple format. Our results necessitate the need for further improving the existing mechanistic foam modeling methods with focus on process upscaling.  Introduction Aqueous foam flooding is an effective technique to control gas mobility in permeable porous media with successful applications to improving volumetric sweep efficiency in miscible/immiscible gas flooding and steam flooding (Schramm, 1994; Rossen, 1996; Patzek, 1996). Recently, foam has proved to be the low-cost alternative to polymer in chemical flooding in difficult reservoir conditions such as very low permeability rocks and high temperature (Srivastava and Nguyen, 2010; Srivastava et al., 2010). In addition to the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, foam has been routinely used to direct flow of cleaning fluids such as surfactant and acid solutions in aquifer remediation (Hirasaki et al., 2000) and well stimulation (Gdanski, 1993), respectively.  The physical principle of foam-induced fluid mobility control in the above applications is based on the resistance of aqueous foam films (or lamellas) to gas flow and the reduction of available flow area to gas and liquid phases due to gas trapping during multi-phase flow. Experimental studies show that the flowing gas fraction in foam in porous media ranges from 50% to less than 1% (Radke and Gillis, 1990; Friedmann et al., 1991; Tang and Kovscek, 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009; Kil et al., 2011). The flowing gas moves in discrete \"bubble trains?? through beds of trapped bubbles (Falls et al., 1989). The gas blocking in porous media results from the resistance of individual lamellas to stretching and the pressure difference across them. Lamellas move to the pore throats, if foam is at rest, due to the gas diffusion between bubbles (Rossen, 1996; Cohen et al., 1997). Resistance to the movement of a lamella is at highest level at the pore throat as it scales with the inverse of the pore-throat radius. The capacity of foam-induced fluid blocking on a field scale in acid diversion, reduction of gas channeling, and reduced liquid injectivity in surfactant alternating gas (SAG) process is thus strongly influenced by the level of gas trapping. Moreover, accurate prediction of flowing gas fraction under reservoir conditions plays a major role in designing mass exchange between injected gas and oil in place in miscible gas processes. "

During injection of these high-viscosity, non-Newtonian polymers, a significant pressure drop may occur along the length of the well. Accurate models for pressure drop in the well and polymer leakage into the reservoir are necessary for simulation but presently do not exist. We developed new, approximate models for pressure in horizontal wells based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of coupled well/reservoir flow. Here, the polymer is shear-thinning in the wellbore and may exhibit viscoelastic effects (such as shear-thickening behavior) in the surrounding reservoir. The CFD results are used to improve existing analytical models for simple, Newtonian flows. The closed-form model accounts for fluid, well, and reservoir properties and can easily be implemented into conventional reservoir simulators. The CFD-based model was directly implemented into the reservoir simulator UTCHEM to evaluate the effect of pressure loss in the well on sweep efficiency. Early times (less than 100 days) yielded a significant loss in oil recovery when compared to the uniform-pressure assumption for the well. However, at later times the recovery loss was negligible, suggesting a uniform-pressure well may be a reasonable assumption at these time scales, even for highly-viscous polymer fluids. "

This is particularly true for measurements of fluid yield stress, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Marsh Funnels are popular quality-control tools used in the field for drilling fluids and they offer a simple, practical alternative to viscosity measurement. In the normal measurements, a single point (drainage time) is used to determine an average viscosity; little additional information is extracted regarding the non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. Here, a new model is developed and used to determine the rheological properties of drilling muds and other non-Newtonian fluids using data of fluid volume collected from a Marsh Funnel as a function of time. The funnel results for viscosity and shear-thinning index compare favorably to the values obtained from a commonly-used Fann 35 viscometer. More importantly, an objective, static method for determining yield stress is introduced, which has several advantages over dynamic, extrapolation techniques used for rheometer data. "

Hence, the selection of an appraisal strategy can indirectly influence later go/no-go decisions. Reservoirs are appraised by drilling and producing wells. In unconventional reservoirs, these wells represent a small subset of possible wells that could be monetized if the decision were made to develop the reservoir (i.e., the appraisal wells sample an underlying population of possible wells). This study explores how an optimal appraisal strategy can be designed in terms of the number of appraisal phases, the number of wells to be drilled in each appraisal stage, and how long to produce the appraisal wells before deciding whether to abandon the project or to proceed to the next stage. It is demonstrated how the view on the average expected ultimate recovery (EUR) of a well in an unconventional reservoir can be continually revised as new information surfaces. Production data from a large well set from the Montney Formation, which straddles British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, is used to assess how accurately initial production predicts the expected ultimate recovery of a single well.

                    "abstract": "Drilling costs in the petroleum industry have continued to escalate over the past decade. This trend has increased operators' attempts to access the largest possible hydrocarbon resources with the lowest achievable costs in order to meet expected investment returns. To accomplish this, multiple well objectives are set prior to the start of drilling operations. Then, in many cases, a geosteering approach is implemented to help operators achieve these objectives. While the geosteering approach has a number of clear strengths and benefits, the efficiency of the current approach of using geosteering to optimize multiple well objectives is still questionable. A comprehensive review of geosteering case histories discussed in SPE papers has been performed. Many of the field cases discussed in these papers include multiple well objectives. The listed objectives are often conflicting and expressed in different measures. However, none of the cases from the reviewed literature have presented or discussed a systematic approach for dealing with multiple objectives in geosteering contexts. Although many will argue that the petroleum industry has adopted best-in-class technologies to support faster and better decisions, making real-time well placement decisions to meet all objectives is no simple task. It is impossible to optimize conflicting objectives at the same time without trading off the achievement of one objective against another. Without a well-structured approach, decision makers are likely to make judgments about the relative importance of each objective based on previous experience or on approximate methods. Research shows that such decision-making approaches are unlikely to identify optimal courses of action. In this paper, we develop and illustrate a consistent multi-criteria decision-making process adapted to operational geosteering decisions. Using this process, we demonstrate the impact of different criteria, and combinations of criteria, on the resulting well trajectories and well final placements. We present a case study that applies multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies to geosteering operations. The proposed method can assist the geosteering teams (GST) in their analysis and evaluation of multiple criteria for making better and more informed decisions. We believe that the method developed and presented in this paper will provide a consistent and transparent guideline for making geosteering decisions using multiple objectives. Employing this approach can assist operators in optimizing well placement while balancing trade-offs among objectives according to the organizations' strategic and operational preferences. "

We assume that the Xi are identically distributed with common mean m and variance s2 This is often reasonable, as companies view the development of unconventional reservoirs as a statistical plays; some wells will be profitable and others will not. Lacking an ability to identify the wells that fall into each category, a package of wells is drilled with the hope that the average reserves m will exceed some minimum threshold t. We further assume that given m and s2 are known, the wells are probabilistically independent. Therefore, we assume the wells are independent and identically distributed (iid). In practice, the iid assumption means that (1) we do not have any reason to believe one location is likely to be more profitable than any other and (2) the drilling results at one location do not change our beliefs about the potential profitability of another location, given that m and s2 are known. If either m or s2 are uncertain then prior drilling results at one or more locations will tell us something about the future prospects for the field. "

Building on the 2008 DOI MMS report \"A Probabilistic Approach to Risk Assessment of Managed Pressure Drilling in Offshore Applications\" (MMS 08), we construct a probabilistic risk analysis model. This model is based on specifying deviations and their cause-consequence relationships. Particular attention is given to deviations that may be mitigated by managed pressure drilling (MPD) operations. Specifically, we illustrate the use of influence diagrams (IDs) or Bayesian networks (BNs) to assess the risk benefit of MPD. One important benefit of our work is the presentation of MMS08 using IDs, which are a much easier method of communicating complex probabilistic models. MMS08, while quite detailed, lacked many important assessments that would be required to calculate the probability of a well control incident (WCI), which was define as a kick. We supplement this missing information by making several assumptions. These assumptions limit the applicability of the analysis we present here, but not the underlying models and methods. In the case we analyze, causes vary widely in terms of how much they contribute to the risk of a WCI. This suggests that using our tool to focus on the most important risk drivers could pay large dividends. In terms of the risk characteristics of MPD, three of our top ten risks could be addressed by MPD. Eliminating all of the risks that could be addressed by MPD reduced the probability of a WCI by 22% in our illustrative example. "

The benefits of geosteering have become more pronounced as drilling environments have become more complex. Geosteering-related technologies, such as downhole information-gathering tools and real-time data-transmission and data-analysis applications, have been continuously and significantly improved to support geosteering decisions. However, the full value of these advancements has yet to be realized.Because of uncertainties in predrill geological models, information gathered while drilling is applied in making real-time reservoir navigation decisions. To achieve an optimal result requires a series of high-quality decisions regarding well-trajectory adjustment. Interestingly, geosteering-related literature does not demonstrate that the industry has applied a logically consistent approach for making geosteering decisions. Common practice, as described in the literature, does not clearly and quantitatively state measurable objectives, key underlying uncertainties, or relevance between underlying uncertainties and real-time information. Furthermore, it is unclear how a specific geosteering decision is being reached. Lacking a systematic and transparent framework for supporting geosteering decisions, the current approach is unlikely to result in optimal decisions for placing the well in the best possible location.1 In this paper, we introduce and discuss a decision-driven approach to the geosteering process. The main contributions of the paper are threefold: (1) a review of 46 SPE papers on geosteering, including a discussion of the main features of current geosteering methods; (2) the development and discussion of a decision analytic framework to support high-quality geosteering decisions; and (3) implementation of Bayesian inference techniques to consistently update ahead-of-the-bit reservoir uncertainties while behind-the-bit data are gathered in real time. The new framework relates real-time information to the key reservoir uncertainties and provides an unbiased and consistent approach for making high-quality geosteering decisions. "

The main objective of this paper is to provide a decision-analytic framework to quantify the value of acquiring additional information regarding reservoir permeability. Uncertainty in reservoir characterization translates into risks of CO2 migration out of the containment zone (or lease zone) and non-compliance with contractual requirements on CO2 storage capacity. The field we consider is based on an actual, and mature, field located in Texas. Subsurface modeling of the injection zone was conducted using well logs, field-specific GIS data, and other relevant published literature. The value of information (VOI) was quantified by defining prior scenarios based on the current knowledge of the reservoir, contractual requirements, and regulatory constraints. The project operator has the option to obtain more reliable estimates of permeability, which will help reduce the uncertainty of the CO2 plume behavior and storage capacity of the formation. The reliability of the information-gathering activities is then applied to the prior probabilities (Bayesian inference) to infer the value of such data. "

Analysts are frequently concerned with how to best structure, compute, and communicate decision models under these circumstances. While decision trees are well suited for discrete random variables with a few possibilities, they become unmanageable for a large number of outcomes. To address this concern, analysts frequently use discrete approximations such as Swanson's Mean. Previous work has quantified how well differing discretization methods match the moments (e.g., the mean and variance) of the underlying continuous distribution. More specifically, previous work has not included the decision context in which the discretizations are used. In this paper, we begin to address this gap by comparing different discretizations within the context of an information-gathering decision problem. We find that the best discretization is highly dependent on the decision context, which is difficult to specify in advance. In addition, we contrast the use of discrete approximations to Monte Carlo simulation. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In shale plays, as with all reservoirs, it is desirable to achieve the optimal development strategies, particularly well spacing, as early as possible, without overdrilling. This paper documents a new technology that can aid in determining optimal development strategies in shale reservoirs. We integrate a decline-curve-based reservoir model with a decision model that incorporates uncertainty in production forecasts. Our work extends previous work by not only correlating well spacing and other completion parameters with performance indicators, but also developing an integrated model that can forecast production probabilistically and determine the impact of development decisions on long-term production.  A public data set of 64 horizontal wells in the Barnett shale play in Cooke, Montague and Wise Counties, Texas, was used to construct the integrated model. This part of the Barnett shale is in the oil window and wells produce significant volumes of hydrocarbon liquids. The data set includes directional surveys, completion and stimulation data, and oil and gas production data. Completion and stimulation parameters, such as perforated interval, fluid volume, proppant mass, and well spacing, were correlated with decline curve parameters, such as initial oil rate and a proxy for the initial decline rate, the ratio of cumulative production at 6 months to 1 month (CP6to1), using linear regression. In addition, a GOR model was developed based on thermal maturity and average GOR versus time. Thousands of oil and gas production forecasts were generated from linear regression and GOR models using Monte Carlo simulation, which serve as the input to the decision model. The decision model then determines the impact of well spacing and other completion/stimulation decisions on long-term production performance.  The technology introduced in this paper can be used to help operators in unconventional reservoirs reach optimal spacing and completion strategies earlier in the lives of these reservoirs, which could accelerate production and increase reserves.  Introduction Since the successful application of horizontal drilling and slick water fracturing in shale plays, interest in shale reservoirs has increased significantly. It is important for operators to identify optimal development strategies in the early stages of development, but this is difficult when there is little production data and limited understanding of reservoir properties and production mechanisms (Lee and Sidle, 2010). Statistical moving-window techniques have been employed to identify optimal well spacings in unconventional gas plays (Gao and McVay, 2004; Voneiff and Cipolla, 1996). However, the moving-window techniques are typically applied deterministically and hence cannot quantify the significant uncertainty inherent in shale plays.  Turkarslan et al. (2010) introduced an integrated model using stochastic reservoir simulation and decision analysis to optimize well spacing and quantify reserves uncertainty in unconventional gas reservoirs. However, the method is computationally intensive and requires significant amounts of data to relate reservoir and completion/stimulation parameters to production performance. LaFollette and Holcomb (2011) performed an extensive data-mining study in the Barnett shale in an effort to relate production performance directly to completion and stimulation parameters; however, the relationships discovered were not used for production forecasts and hence to optimize development strategies.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Despite our increased experience, unconventional gas plays remain risky. In the face of this risk, operators must balance the need to conserve capital and protect the environment by avoiding over drilling with the desire to maximize profitability by achieving the optimal well spacing as quickly as possible. Previous unconventional gas developments such as the Carthage Field (Cotton Valley) have implemented multiple infill drilling programs over several decades to optimize well spacing, with significant reduction in value (McKinney et al. 2002). However, in emerging plays such as the non-core Barnett Shale and the Fayetteville Shale, historical infill programs are not available to evaluate optimal spacing and we do not have the luxury of developing these fields over the next 30-40 years. Existing approaches for optimizing development, such as integrated reservoir simulation studies or statistical moving-window methods, can be either prohibitively time-consuming and expensive or they do not consider the uncertainty inherent in the assessment.  The objective of our work was to develop technology and tools to help operators determine optimal well spacing in highly uncertain and risky unconventional gas reservoirs as quickly as possible. To achieve the research objectives, we developed an integrated reservoir and decision modeling system that incorporates uncertainty. We used Monte Carlo simulation with a fast, approximate reservoir simulation model to match and predict production performance in unconventional gas reservoirs. Simulation results are then integrated with a Bayesian decision model that accounts for the risk facing operators. We applied these integrated tools to a hypothetical case based on data from Deep Basin (Gething) tight gas sands in Alberta, Canada, to determine optimal development strategies.  We anticipate that the tools and methodologies developed will be applicable in most shale and tight gas reservoirs. These tools should ultimately be able to help operators determine, for example, the combination of primary development strategy (well spacing and/or completion method) and testing (pilot downspacings and/or tests of other completion methods) that maximizes future profitability. The optimal design of such programs in unconventional reservoirs, where the risks are high, is likely to pay large dividends.  Introduction The rapid growth in world energy demand and the higher depletion rates of existing oil and gas reserves have initiated a gap between conventional energy demand and supply (Zahid et al. 2007). To bridge this fast-growing energy gap and create a sustainable future energy supply, the global petroleum industry is investing heavily in exploration and development of unconventional energy resources.  In North America, federal tax credits and technical development programs led by private organizations, public companies and government agencies were implemented to facilitate the advancement of technology related to unconventional natural gas exploration and exploitation. With the advancement of technology in the fields of geosciences, drilling, completion and production, accompanied by increasing gas prices in the early- to mid-2000's, interest in shale gas, tight gas sands and coalbed methane has grown significantly (Xiong and Holditch 2006).

                    "abstract": "Natural gas hydrate may be buried with sediments until it is no longer stable at a given pressure and temperature, resulting in conversion of hydrate into free gas. This gas may migrate upward and recycle back into the hydrate stability zone to form hydrate. As of yet, however, no quantitative description of the methane recycling process has been developed using multiphase flow simulations to model burial-driven gas hydrate recycling. In this study, we present a series of 1D multiphase transport simulations to investigate the methane recycling process in detail. By invoking the effects of capillary phenomena on hydrate and gas formation in pores of varying size, we find that a free gas phase can migrate a significant distance above the bulk base of hydrate stability. Since the top of the free gas occurrence is often identified as the base of the hydrate stability zone from seismic data, our results demonstrate that not only could this assumption mischaracterize a hydrate system, but that under recycling conditions the highest hydrate saturations can occur beneath the top of the free gas occurrence. We show that the presence of pore size distributions requires a replacement zone through which hydrate saturations progressively decrease with depth and are replaced with free gas. This replacement zone works to buffer against significant gas buildup that could lead to fracturing of overlying sediments. This work provides a framework for simulating flow and transport of methane within the 3-phase stability zone from a mass conservation perspective. "

                    "abstract": "Leak-off tests (LOTs) are performed to determine the strength of a newly drilled formation below a cased interval and to characterize the upper bound of mud weight that can be safely used while drilling the next section, without risk of formation breakdown and lost circulation. In an LOT, drilling mud is pumped into the wellbore, causing the wellbore pressure to increase and exceed the formation pore pressure. During the initial LOT build up, excess pressure in the wellbore causes the surrounding rock to deform and mud filtrate to invade into the formation via porous flow. In this paper, change in formation resistivity around a wellbore during initial LOT build-up has been investigated. Invasion is modeled assuming two-phase radial Darcy flow and deformation using a 3D finite element model. Invasion may result in an exchange of conductive ions between water-based drilling mud and formation water both by diffusion in the direction favored by the concentration gradient of the ions and by convective transport. This process is incorporated into the model by solving the radial convection-diffusion equation for the aqueous phase using a finite difference method. Archie's law is used to determine the formation resistivity. Findings show that the direct effect of deformation on porosity, therefore on formation resistivity during an LOT, is negligibly small even when the formation rock is highly compressible with compressibility in the order of 10−3 psi−1. While salinity solely controls formation resistivity during an LOT conducted in a fully water-saturated interval, water saturation change and salinity change compete to produce a compound effect on formation resistivity of an oil-bearing zone where water saturation varies dynamically due to displacement of formation fluids. Unlike compressibility, the effect of permeability on formation resistivity response is found to be evident and readily observable. While analyzing the formation resistivity responses at various depths of investigation (DOIs), it is found that the effect of DOI on resistivity response can be useful in studying invasion and assessing formation damage during an LOT. In addition to this, through comparing time-lapse resistivity logs at multiple DOIs during an LOT with numerically synthesized resistivity responses, the model promises a novel approach towards determining the permeability of a freshly drilled and unaltered interval.

                    "abstract": "Water-in-water (w/w) emulsions are known for their low interfacial tensions (IFT) which makes their stability to shear questionable. This is because of low particle attachment energies, which can be just a few kT. Therefore, emulsions stabilized with larger particles should display greater stability to shear because of larger attachment energies (10–100 or more kT). This is typically not an issue with traditional oil-in-water Pickering emulsions because particle attachment energies are much larger due to higher interfacial tensions, even when very small particles are used. Silica nanoparticles were silanized with 2-(methoxy(polyethyleneoxy)6-9propyl)trimethoxysilane (PEG-silane) to aid in emulsion stabilization. The phase behavior of an aqueous, two-phase system consisting of 20,000 g mol−1 polyethylene glycol (PEG) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) was characterized. Optical microscopy was used to characterize the static properties of the particle stabilized emulsions and shear rheology was used to study the stability of emulsions stabilized with 6 nm and 50 nm PEG-silane functionalized particles. We demonstrated that silica nanoparticles silanized with PEG-silane can stabilize MgSO4 drops to produce MgSO4-in-PEG emulsions. We found emulsions stabilized with 6 wt% particles, regardless of particle size (6 nm or 50 nm), had similar viscosities, emulsion drop size, and were statically stable for one week. Emulsion drops stabilized with 6 wt% 50 nm particles doubled in size after 80 min of shear at 10 s−1 whereas those stabilized with 6 wt% 6 nm particles required only 25 min to double in size. We attribute these differences in doubling time to the larger particle attachment energies associated with the 50 nm particles. "

                    "abstract": "Real-time drilling optimization is a topic of significant interest because of its economic value, and its importance increases particularly during periods of low oil prices. This paper evaluates different optimization strategies and algorithms for real-time optimization of an objective function (function to be optimized) specific to drilling. The objective function optimized here is derived from a data-driven (or machine-learning) model with an unknown functional form. A data-driven model has been used to calculate the objective function [rate of penetration (ROP)] because it has been shown to be more efficient in ROP prediction relative to deterministic models (Hegde and Gray 2017). The data-driven ROP model is built using machine-learning algorithms; measured drilling parameters [weight on bit (WOB), revolutions per minute (rev/min), strength of rock, and flow rate] are used as inputs to predict the ROP. Real-time drilling optimization that is data-driven is challenging because of run-time constraints. This is perceived as a handicap for data-driven models because their functional form is unknown, making them more difficult to optimize. This paper evaluates algorithms depending on their ability to best maximize the objective (ROP) and their time effectiveness. Two simple yet robust algorithms, the eyeball method and the random-search method, are presented as plausible solutions to this problem. These methods are then compared with popular metaheuristic algorithms, evaluating the tradeoff between improvement in the objective (search for a global optimal) and the computational time of run. Using results from the simulations conducted in this paper, we concluded that data-driven models can be used for real-time drilling despite their computational constraints by choosing the right optimization algorithm. The best tradeoff in terms of ROP increase as well as computational efficiency evaluated in this paper is the simplex algorithm. The ROP was improved by 30% on average with a variance of 2.5% in the test set over 14 formations that were tested. "

A fundamental challenge in applying this technology for detecting underground nuclear explosions is estimating the timing and magnitude of the radionuclide signatures. While the primary mechanism for transport is advective transport, either through barometric pumping or thermally driven advection, diffusive transport in the surrounding matrix also plays a secondary role. From the study of primordial noble gas signatures, it is known that xenon has a strong physical adsorption affinity in shale formations. Given the unselective nature of physical adsorption, isotherm measurements reported here show that non-trivial amounts of xenon adsorb on a variety of media, in addition to shale. A dual-porosity model is then discussed demonstrating that sorption amplifies the diffusive uptake of an adsorbing matrix from a fracture. This effect may reduce the radioxenon signature down to approximately one-tenth, similar to primordial xenon isotopic signatures. "

                    "abstract": "Application of nanoparticles in the subsurface typically requires the use of surface coatings to maintain stability in dispersion and to provide particular functionality. However, the presence of surface coatings may hinder or mask properties of the bare nanoparticle cores, which may be a concern in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) applications. In this study, we used different amounts of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) coating on Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (A-MNPs). We measured the longitudinal relaxation time (T1) values of those A-MNPs suspensions, and computed and compared the surface relaxivities of A-MNPs with different amounts of APTES coating. Our results showed that when the mass percentage of APTES coating increased from 1.60 to 4.22 wt%, the A-MNPs’ surface relaxivity decreased by 26.1%. To determine the surface relaxation mechanism(s), we also used various volume fractions of D2O to dilute A-MNP dispersions to two concentrations: 0.01 and 0.002 g/L Fe. In the final mixtures, the volume fractions of D2O were fixed as 0-, 30-, 50-, and 70-vol%. The NMR measurements indicated that, at relatively high Fe concentration (0.01 g/L), electron-proton interaction dominates surface relaxation, and the hydrogen atoms in the APTES did not significantly alter the surface relaxation mechanism of the nanoparticles. At a lower Fe concentration (0.002 g/L), proton-proton relaxation, due to the APTES, also played a role in the overall relaxation mechanism on nanoparticle surfaces. A-MNPs with more APTES coating showed lower apparent surface relaxivities with higher D2O volume fractions in the mixture, indicating a greater amount of proton-proton relaxation on the nanoparticle surfaces. Introduction With superior magnetic properties, nanoscale dimensions and nontoxic characteristics, iron oxide nanoparticles are of high interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology. As superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), Fe3O4 nanoparticles have been widely applied in biomedical areas, such as targeted drug delivery (Chertok et al., 2008), tissue repair (Jordan et al., 2001) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques (Babes et al., 1999).

We explored the pore structure of shale matrix with low-pressure nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms. The pore size distribution, the network connectivity, as well as pore spatial arrangement are determined for the organic matter and the whole matrix. We separated pores in the network model into two groups: the affiliated pores and the dominant pores. For these samples, the affiliated pores are pores with diameters smaller than 8 nm and the dominant pores are with diameters larger than 8 nm. The affiliated pores develop on the walls of the dominant pores. The cutoff value between affiliated pores and dominant pores may differ for different samples. The pore spatial arrangement is validated against previous literature resultsand a diagenetic explanation for development of shale pore system.

                    "abstract": "In well logging applications, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is recognized as a powerful tool to differentiate various fluids inside porous media. However, it can be challenging to do so in complex situations, e.g. when fluid peaks overlap with each other. Water-soluble contrast agents, such as MnCl2 or Gd-EDTA, have been proposed for use to accelerate the water relaxation, thus separating the water signal from those of other fluids. Together with these contrast agents, the log-inject-log method is used and the difference between the two logs is attributed to the doped water phase. This application only works with water-based mud. To extend its use to oil-based mud (OBM), it is desirable to find alternatives to water-soluble contrast agents that are compatible with OBM. In this work, we introduce a new group of doping agents: oil-soluble contrast agents. We selected several iron-based complex compounds that are oil-soluble, and tested and evaluated their effects on oil signal relaxation using a laboratory NMR apparatus. We also tested hydrophobic iron oxide nanoparticles as a contrast agent. The results showed that both the complex compounds and nanoparticles were able to reduce the transverse relaxation time of oil from longer than 2 s to less than 20 ms. To demonstrate their applicability in porous media, we injected doped oil into gas-saturated Berea sandstone and limestone core plugs. With conventional 1D NMR measurements or the use of water-soluble contrast agents, it is not straightforward to discern the gas signal from the OBM signal. Our experiments showed that the gas signal could be easily identified in the presence of doped oil via simple T2 scans. We also performed experiments to demonstrate that the peaks of water and doped oil could be readily differentiated. The use of oil-soluble doping agents can significantly enhance the contrast of the NMR signals originated from different formation fluids, thus facilitating the fluid typing process. It provides a key alternative to the current water-doping technique. It is particularly advantageous when changing the oil relaxation is desired, such as for eliminating signal interferences from OBM invasion and differentiating heavy oil from clay-bound water. It also provides the possibility of speeding up the logging process by dramatically reducing the oil relaxation time. In addition, they can be employed in the laboratory for various purposes such as water saturation determination and fluid displacement monitoring. These contrast agents can also be of useful when oil-soluble contrast agents are desired in other fields, such as medical imaging applications. "

Our mapping shows that the pattern of active faulting changed from distributed across the shelf to localized away from the primary glacial depocenter over ∼300–780 kyrs, following an order-of-magnitude increase in sediment accumulation rates. Simple Coulomb stress calculations show that the suppression of faulting is partially controlled by the change in sediment accumulation rates which created a differential pore pressure regime between the underlying, faulted strata and the overlying, undeformed sediments.

This high G′0 can be problematic for subsurface applications where brine salinities are higher and on the order of 600 mM NaCl. High reservoir salinity coupled with low formation pressure drops could prevent an emulsion with a high G′0 from propagating deep into formation. It is hypothesized that G′0 of an emulsion can be minimized by using sterically stabilized silica nanoparticles modified with the hydrophilic silane (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (glymo). Bromohexadecane-in-water emulsions were stabilized with low and high coverage glymo nanoparticles. Oscillatory rheology was used to monitor G′0 as a function of nanoparticle concentration, oil volume fraction, salinity, and pH. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy was used to make observations on the emulsion microstructure. G′0 of bromohexadecane-in-water emulsions were minimized by using particles with a high coverage of glymo on the particle surface, which reduced the Ca2+/silanol site interactions. Emulsions that were stabilized with low surface coverage particles had noticeably higher G′0, however, their G′0 could be reduced by a factor of 3.3 by simply lowering the solution pH to 3. Cryo-SEM images showed that nanoparticle bridging was more pronounced with nanoparticles that had low glymo coverage as opposed to high coverage. "

In rocks, magnetic and paramagnetic cations in pore fluid may interact with nanoparticles and affect the magnetic resonance properties of the nanoparticles, which in turn makes interpretation of NMR measurements difficult if this effect is not accounted for. In this work, two groups of zirconia nanoparticles: one with positive surface charge, the other with negative surface charge; and a group of silica nanoparticles coated with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and negatively charged were mixed with Fe(III) solution for interaction and/or adsorption to occur. T1 values of fluid with different concentrations of Fe(III) ranging from 9 mg/L to 50 mg/L were obtained, and we confirmed a linear relationship between Fe concentration and T1 values at fixed pH conditions. The T1 values of zirconia and silica nanoparticle dispersions before and after mixing with various Fe(III) solutions were measured and compared. Adsorption of iron onto zirconia nanoparticles was confirmed based on measurements of aqueous Fe remaining in supernatants. The response of silica nanoparticles mixed with Fe solutions was also consistent with adsorption of Fe ions on the silica nanoparticle surfaces. Adsorbed iron increases zirconia nanoparticles’ surface relaxivity by more than 50 fold, and the relaxation rate of zirconia nanoparticles increased with the amount of adsorbed Fe(III). "

Data-driven models are built using machine learning algorithms, using surface measured input features - weight-on-bit, RPM, and flow rate – to predict ROP. Both models are used to predict ROP; models are compared with each other based on accuracy and goodness of fit (R2). Based on the results from these simulations, it was concluded that data-driven models are more accurate and provide a better fit than traditional models. Data-driven models performed better with a mean error of 12% and improve the R2 of ROP prediction from 0.12 to 0.84.

The Terrebonne Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico provides an ideal setting to investigate the migration of methane resulting in the formation of hydrate in thin sand units interbedded with fractured muds. Using 3D seismic and well log data, we have identified several previously unidentified hydrate bearing units in the Terrebonne Basin. Two units are >100 m-thick fine-grained clay-rich units where gas hydrate occurs in near-vertical fractures. In some locations, these fine-grained units lack fracture features, and they contain 1–4-m thick hydrate bearing-sands. In addition, several other thin sand units were identified that contain gas hydrate, including one sand that was intersected by a well at the location of a discontinuous bottom-simulating reflector. Using correlation of well log data to seismic data, we have mapped and described these new units in detail across the extent of the available data, allowing us to determine the variation of seismic amplitudes and investigate the distribution of free gas and/or hydrate. We present several potential source-reservoir scenarios between the thick fractured mud units and thin hydrate bearing sands. We observe that hydrate preferentially forms within thin sand layers rather than fractures when sands are present in larger marine mud units. Based on regional mapping showing the patchy lateral extent of the thin sand layers, we propose that diffusive methane migration or short-migration of microbially generated methane from the marine mud units led to the formation of hydrate in these thin sands, as discontinuous sands would not be conducive to long-range migration of methane from deeper reservoirs.

The change in stress state with depletion induces a change in permeability both in the far-field and the near wellbore region. Modeling the depletion induced permeability alteration is crucial in forecasting hydrocarbon production and designing a drilling strategy. Porosity-based permeability models are typically used in which the permeability changes are assumed to be isotropic. However, most rocks are anisotropic, and the stress changes due to depletion and drilling a well are also anisotropic. As an example, we compared isotropic and anisotropic permeability predictions around a hypothetical well drilled in the Tor formation in Valhall field in the North Sea. The results show that isotropic permeability models tend to underestimate the degree of permeability reduction in the near-wellbore region, but even when anisotropy is considered, the permeability in the radial direction still only decreases by about 10%. These results may still need to be considered when designing a development strategy in depleted reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "The operational use of nanoparticles (NPs) in drilling and completion fluids is still limited at the present time, in part due to lack of consistent evidence for - and clarification of - NP interactions with rock formations, formation fluid, and other fluid additives. For instance, previous fluids research has emphasized that NPs bring about \"pore plugging\" that reduces pressure transmission, and in turn fluid inflow, into the shale pore matrix which ultimately helps stabilize the borehole. However, it is difficult to understand how pore plugging might be accomplished in the absence of any considerable filtration in shales considering the very low permeability of shales does not allow for any appreciable Darcy flow. This paper addresses the crucial question: \"how, when, why do nanoparticles plug up shale pore throats?\" Zeta Potential (ZP) measurements were carried out on the aqueous dispersions (NPs) and on intact shale thin sections exposed to the nanofluid in order to determine the degree of interaction behavior between NPs and shales. The experimental data was then used to calculate DLVO curves (describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium) in order to determine if the total potential energy was sufficient for NP's to diffuse through the repulsive barrier and attract (or overcome repulsion) to the shale surface. Estimated DLVO curves are used to demonstrate the NP's ability to contribute to borehole stability but are not directly correlated, and therefore, NP effects on shale stability were studied in detail using pore pressure transmission tests (PTT), which measure fluid pressure penetration in shales, and modified Thick Wall Collapse (TWC) tests, which explore the influence of NPs on the collapse pressure of shale samples. Our investigation shows that NPs can reduce fluid pressure penetration and delay borehole collapse in shales, but only under certain conditions. Electrostatic and electrodynamic interaction between NP's and shale surfaces, governed by DLVO forces, is the main mechanism that will lead to pore throat plugging, reducing pressure transmission, which in turn benefits borehole stability by slowing down near-wellbore pore-pressure elevation and effective stress reduction. For Mancos shale, it was shown that 20 nm nanosilica (anionic) are effective in partially plugging the pore throat system, depending on the pH of the nanofluid, which affects the surface potential and ZP of both NPs and shale. Furthermore, the positively charged nanosilica (cationic) showed better results for pore-plugging capabilities than the anionic nanosilica. The findings lead to some interesting challenges for the practical field application of NP-based drilling fluids for borehole stability, given that efficacy will depend on the specific type of shale, the specific type, size and concentration of NP, the interaction between NP-shale, and external factors such as pH, salinity, temperature etc. NP use for practical shale stabilization therefore requires a dedicated, thoroughly engineered solution for each particular field application, and is unlikely to be \"one size fits all\".

Critical path analysis (CPA) offers a framework for predicting relative permeability based on pore system properties, including the percolation threshold and breadth of the pore size distribution. Using an existing method developed for partially saturated soils, I show that CPA can accurately predict relative permeability to either water or gas over the entire range of measured hydrate saturation for several suites of laboratory measurements. The method does not require any assumption of hydrate growth habit, and assumes that hydrate tends to grow in the largest pores first.

I assumed that the pore sizes in my samples exhibited fractal scaling and expressed the electrical formation factor as a function of porosity using universal scaling from percolation theory. The resulting CPA permeability predictions match the measured values very well. In addition, I show how considering the scale-dependence of the percolation threshold yields two characteristic length scales for transport properties: the critical pore size, and the sample size.

                    "abstract": "The removal of highly stable dispersed oil produced during oil recovery processes is very challenging, especially in offshore operations where the limited space does not allow use of equipment with long residence time for the required separation. Using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to remove the dispersed oil from produced water is a promising way to overcome the difficulties that the current treatment technologies face, since the MNPs-attached oil droplets can be quickly and efficiently separated with application of an external magnetic field. The MNPs can be also regenerated and reused, minimizing the generation of hazardous waste. We investigated not only the optimal operating conditions, such as MNP concentration and salinity, but also the mechanisms of MNPs-oil attachment and magnetic separation. We synthesized MNPs in the laboratory with a prescribed surface coating. The MNPs were superparamagnetic with an average individual particle size of ~10 nm. Crude oil content in separated water was reduced by as much as 99.9% using MNP concentrations as low as 0.04 wt% in 5 minutes after MNPs and oil were reacted. The electrostatic attraction between negatively charged oil-in-water emulsions and positively charged MNPs controls the attachment of MNPs to the droplet surface; and the subsequent aggregation of the electrically neutral MNPs-attached oil droplets plays a critical role for accelerated and efficient magnetic separation. The particle aggregation occurred fast, generally within one minute. Thus, the total magnetic separation time was dramatically reduced to as short as 1 second, contrary to that of free, individual MNPs where it took about 36~72 hours, depending on the MNP concentrations. Model calculations of magnetic separation velocity, accounting for the MNP magnetization and viscous drag, show that the velocity of free Amine functionalized MNPs (A-MNPs) increases about 1~3 orders of magnitude as the particles get closer to the magnet depending on the particle size. The smaller the particles, the greater the effect of the magnetic field on the velocity. A typical operating condition would be when the size of the MNPs-oil droplet aggregates is grown to be greater than 360 nm. Then, the total magnetic separation time will be approximately 5 minutes.

Rate of penetration (ROP) modeling is a key tool in optimizing drilling parameters, namely bit weight and rotary speed, for faster drilling processes. With a novel, all-automated data visualization and ROP modeling tool developed in Excel VBA, ROPPlotter, this work investigates model performance and the impact of rock strength on model coefficients of two different PDC bit ROP models: Hareland and Rampersad (1994) and Motahhari et al. (2010). These two PDC bit models are compared against a base case, general ROP relation developed by Bingham (1964) in three different sandstone formations in the vertical section of a Bakken shale horizontal well. For the first time, an attempt has been made to isolate the effect of varying rock strength on ROP model coefficients by investigating lithologies with otherwise similar drilling parameters. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion on the importance of selecting appropriate model coefficients bounds is conducted. Rock strength, accounted for in Hareland's and Motahhari's models but not in Bingham's, results in higher values of constant multiplier model coefficients for the former models, in addition to an increased RPM term exponent for Motahhari's model. Hareland and Rampersad's model is shown to perform best out of the three models with this particular dataset. The effectiveness and applicability of traditional ROP modeling is brought to question, as such models rely on a set of empirical coefficients that incorporate the effect of many drilling factors not accounted for in the model's formulation and are unique to a particular lithology.

                    "abstract": "The wettability of rocks is of fundamental importance to the understanding of fluid transport within hydrocarbon reservoirs. Wettability is intimately tied to the zeta potential, which is determined by the electrostatic forces among the rock's mineral constituents. Extensive prior research has been conducted into the relationship between wettability and surface forces of shale samples that have been ground up and/or otherwise been altered. However, very little attention has been given to measuring the zeta potential of the surface of unbroken, intact shale samples. A new technique is explored in this paper that investigates the zeta potential of the actual surface of shale samples in one intact piece. The surface zeta potential of shales was found to be strongly determined by the mineral composition and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the shale. Shales containing higher amounts of silicates (e.g. quartz, feldspar, and clays such as Illite and Smectite) tended to be water-wet and exhibit higher negative zeta potential values. Shales that contained higher amounts of carbonates (dolomite, aragonite, calcite, etc.) were more oil-wet with zeta potential values that were less negative or slightly positive. Measurements were also performed on Berea and Boise sandstone in order to compare organic vs. inorganic samples. Results for common shales showed Mancos and Marcellus to be intermediate-wet, Oxford and Eagleford to be moderately oil-wet, and Arne to be highly water-wet. Additionally, the zeta potential was also studied in various ionic and nano-particle solutions. "

When compared to conventional emulsion- stabilizing materials such as surfactants, nanoparticles are an inexpensive and robust alternative, offering stability over a wider range of temperature and salinity, while reducing environmental impact. Oil-in-water emulsions with an aqueous nanoparticle phase and either a pentane or butane oil phase at a 1:1 volume ratio were generated at varying salinities for the observations of several emulsion characteristics. The effects of salinity on the stability of silica nanoparticle dispersions and NGL emulsions were observed. Increasing the salinity of the aqueous nanoparticle phase resulted in an increase in effective nanoparticle size due to increased nanoparticle aggregation. Rheology tests and estimates of emulsion droplet sizes were performed. Shear-thinning behavior was observed for all emulsions. Furthermore, overall emulsion viscosity increased with salinity. Nanoparticle-stabilized liquid butane-in-water emulsions were also generated with varying brine concentrations; however, no rheology or droplet size measurements were made due to the volatility of these emulsions. Residual oil recovery coreflood experiments were conducted (using Boise Sandstone cores) with nanoparticle-stabilized pentane-in-water emulsions as injectant and light mineral oil as residual oil. A recovery of up to 82% residual oil was observed for these experiments. By continuously measuring the pressure drop across the core, a possible mechanism for enhanced oil recovery is proposed. Pentane emulsion coreflood tests indicated that at a slower injection rate, residual oil recovery increases. This contrasts viscous emulsion corefloods (mineral oil or Texaco white oil as the emulsion oil phase), where increasing the injection rate increases the residual oil recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Textural characterization is a critical step to assess and evaluate petrophysical properties of unconventional reservoirs, including shale-gas, coalbed and tight-gas systems. Gas adsorption, typically with N2 at 77 K or CO2 at 273 K, is the widely used method for such characterizations. To translate adsorption data into useful petrophysical quantities such as pore size, pore connectivity, and pore volume, one needs to exploit appropriate correlations to link molecular scale interactions and macro-scale phenomena. One important yet under-studied property of unconventional matrices is their true pore structure and its effects on fluid thermodynamics inside pore space. Herein, based on lattice density functional theory, we have developed a multilayer adsorption model with parameterized energy terms, to determine effects of pore shape and pore size (of shale and coal samples) on the thermodynamic state of reservoir fluid. The model is extended from its original slit pore geometry into cylindrical and spherical geometries to consider the effects of local pore curvature on adsorption energetics and uptakes mainly in mesopores (between 2 and 50 nm). In addition, the surface energy term is modified to consider the effect of the force field exerted by pore walls on both the adlayer and subsequent adsorbed layers. Modification of the energy term resulted in layer-by-layer, two-dimensional condensation followed by the final capillary condensation. The force field exerted by the pore walls together with local pore curvature shifted the condensation pressures toward lower relative pressures (P/P0). By applying the model to N2 porosimetry isotherms at 77 K for two reference samples, ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), the model confirmed essentially cylindrical pore structure for both samples. The model was further applied to N2 at 77 K porosimetry isotherms of Woodford shale and Cameo coal samples, and identified the pore structures of the samples as dominated by cylindrical and slit pore geometries, respectively.

However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms or timescales of hydrate formation, which are related to methane supply, fluid flux, and host sediment properties such as permeability. We used logging-while-drilling data from locations in the northern Gulf of Mexico to develop an effective medium theory-based model for predicting permeability based on clay-sized sediment fraction. The model considers permeability varying between sand and clay endpoint permeabilities that are defined from laboratory data. We verified the model using permeability measurements on core samples from three boreholes, and then used the model to predict permeability in two wells drilled in Walker Ridge Block 313 during the Gulf of Mexico Gas Hydrate Joint Industry Project Leg II expedition in 2009. We found that the cleanest sands (clay-sized fraction <0.05) had intrinsic (hydrate-free) permeability contrasts of 5–6 orders of magnitude with the surrounding clays, which is sufficient to provide focused hydrate formation due to advection of methane from a deep source or diffusion of microbial methane from nearby clay layers. In sands where the clay-sized fraction exceeds 0.05, the permeability reduces significantly and focused flow is less pronounced. In these cases, diffusion of dissolved microbial methane is most likely the preferred mode of methane supply for hydrate formation. Our results provide important constraints on methane supply mechanisms in the Walker Ridge area and have global implications for evaluating rates of methane migration and hydrate formation in hydrate-bearing sands.

                    "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements are routinely used to characterize pore size distributions in fluid saturated porous media. The principle of the NMR measurement is that the result is linked with pore size by a parameter named surface relaxivity. However, in natural porous media, surface relaxivity is not constant or well-known due to heterogeneous distributions of impurities on pore surfaces. To control pore surface relaxivity, we injected paramagnetic zirconia nanoparticles into silica porous media: glass bead packs and sandstone core samples. Adsorption of the nanoparticles onto the pore surfaces altered their surface relaxivity due to differences in relaxivity between the silica surfaces and the nanoparticles. NMR measurements of porous media saturated with zirconia nanoparticle dispersions and deionized (DI) water were compared to calculate amount of adsorbed zirconia nanoparticles and quantify the alteration of pore surface relaxivity. Our results indicate that adsorption of nanoparticles onto pore surfaces leaves fewer nanoparticles in dispersion within the pore space and alters surface relaxation on pore wall with attached nanoparticles. The overall relaxation rate of the porous medium is thus affected by adsorption, which changes the surface relaxation rate and the relaxation rate of the fluid within the pore space. Electrostatic interactions drive nanoparticle adsorption onto pore walls. When silica porous media, which have negative surface charge, are saturated with positively charged nanoparticles, the nanoparticles adsorb onto the pore surface. When the porous media are saturated with negatively charged nanoparticles, no adsorption occurs. Our work highlights the importance of surface chemistry and adsorption on nanoparticle behavior in porous media and suggests that fundamental NMR behavior of media may be controlled with targeted adsorption of suitable nanoparticles.

                    "abstract": "Existing models for shale permeability couple advection and diffusion but do not include the effects of fluid saturations on the permeability. Using a combination of critical path analysis, effective medium theory, and percolation theory, we modeled shale relative permeability by considering the effects of pore structure on unsaturated advection and diffusion. Relevant percolation properties were determined from N2 adsorption-desorption measurements. We considered samples of Green River Shale, Woodford Shale, and Cameo Coal, and isolated kerogens from the Green River and Woodford. We considered gas to be the wetting phase in the kerogens and coal and the nonwetting phase in the bulk shales. We found that the nonwetting phase relative permeability scales linearly with the nonwetting phase saturation, while the wetting phase relative permeability exhibits a highly nonlinear relationship with wetting phase saturation due to the large pore space fractal dimensions (>2.68) of the shales. Based on our model, we predict that water production from the shales is expected to be minor until the gas phase reaches its residual saturation, and that the rate of gas transport out of the kerogen and into the shale matrix should decrease rapidly following the onset of production. This may explain in part why shale gas wells typically produce little formation water and exhibit rapid production decline rates. "

                    "abstract": "Herein, we report on a novel dual-site adsorption model to determine state of methane in shale formations and coalbeds. By considering two surface energy terms, the model distinguishes methane adsorption in the intrinsic micropore volume of the organic matter from that of the inorganic structure. One energy term describes methane adsorption in micropores (< 2 nm) whereas the other one concerns with meso-macropores. This study showed that at storage conditions, 150 bar and 50.4 °C, where methane is in supercritical state, the surface energy plays the major role to influence methane adsorption capacity whereas the effect of lateral forces between adsorbed molecules has a minor influence on overall adsorption capacity. We applied the model on experimental methane adsorption data in three organic-rich samples including Woodford shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo coal to quantify their methane storage state. Textural properties of shale and coal samples were analyzed by N2 porosimetry at − 196 °C. The samples had a weak micropore peak followed by a broader peak stretched over meso and macropore regions up to nearly 120 nm. Fitting the dual-site model to experimental methane adsorption data revealed that, among all, the coal sample, with the average heat of adsorption of 24.5 kJ/mol, had the highest interaction energies with both micro- and mesopore sites. Further, we find that 37%, 81% and 83% of methane was stored in the organic matter of Woodford shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo coal, respectively. Considering low maturity, and hence low micropore volume of the samples, and based on significant methane storage in the organic content we estimated that more than 50% of methane gas is being dissolved into the organic matter rather than just being adsorbed into the micropore volume.

We also show that ignoring lower and upper cutoffs of fractal scaling may significantly alter the mass fractal dimension value. For these purposes, two examples using experiments available in the literature are given, and critical analyses are discussed in detail. We also reanalyze three databases reported in the literature, recalculate the mass fractal dimension, and show that applying the arithmetic mean concept and/or ignoring the lower and upper cutoffs may result in substantially different fractal dimension values. We note that the lower and upper cutoffs have to be reported in addition to the mass fractal dimension value. We also emphasize that accurate determination of the fractal scaling parameters, such as fractal dimension and lower and upper cutoffs requires precise characterization of the mass-size distribution.

I determined pore size distributions using the Barrett–Joyner–Hallenda (BJH) model, and merged these with existing mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements to construct a full distribution covering micro- to macropores. I found that overall pore sizes decrease with consolidation, and that microporosity content (pores < 2 nm in diameter) is influenced mainly by mineralogy, with some influence of diagenetic processes. A small amount of microporosity (~ 0.25% of bulk sediment volume) is present in these sediments at the time of burial, presumably contained mainly in clays. Additional microporosity may develop as a result of alteration of volcanic ash at the reference Sites, and may be related to diagenetic processes that create zones of anomalous high porosity. Comparisons with porewater chemistry (K+, Ca2 +, Sr, Si) show inconsistent relationships with microporosity development and cannot confirm or deny the role of ash alteration in this process. The strongest correlation observed at the three Sites was between microporosity volume and clay mineral fraction. This suggests that microporosity content is determined mainly by detrital clay abundance and development of clay as an ash alteration product, with some contribution from amorphous silica cement precipitated in the zones of anomalous high porosity.

Methane solubility was determined to increase by 10–30 percent at Sites C0011 and C0012, while solubility increases at Site C0018 were predicted to be between 10 and 50 percent throughout the methane hydrate stability zone. Further, the increase in methane solubility due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect was found to significantly decrease the mass of methane deposited as hydrate as well as decrease the thickness of the methane hydrate stability zone.

Micro-preformed particle gel (PPG) is one of the commercial gels invented exclusively to plug such features to reduce excess water production and increase oil production. This paper reports the results of laboratory experiments that studied the PPG’s injection and placement mechanism through unconsolidated sandstone cores. Extensive experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the sand permeability, PPG size, concentration, and water salinity on the PPG injection process, passing criteria, and plugging efficiency to water flow. A two foot sand pack model with four pressure taps was designed to monitor PPG transport and plugging performance. The results showed that the PPG propagated deep into the unconsolidated sandstone. Fully swollen gel particles had better injectivity than partially swollen particles with a larger diameter size; particle strength was more dominant in influencing particle movement than was particle size. The injection pressure increased as the PPG concentration, water salinity, and gel particle size increased. High gel particle injection pressure was measured in the front part of the unconsolidated sandstone as a result of gel particle retention. The retention was controllable by selecting proper gel particle strength, concentration, and size. PPG transport through unconsolidated sand exhibited four patterns of injection processes: low gel particle retention and pass; high gel particle retention and pass; high gel particle retention, breaking, and pass; and gel particle accumulation and plug. The micro-gel particle’s blocking efficiency to water flow increased as the PPG strength, size, and concentration increased. The PPG placement mechanism, such as washout, was also found to considerably affect the water injection flow processes. The results of this laboratory experiment will aid in the selection of future conformance control candidates and also optimize the particle gel treatment design for large-scale field projects. "

                    "abstract": "Unstable displacement and the resulting viscous fingers remain a challenge for reservoir simulation as practical gridblock sizes are usually much larger than the viscous finger wavelength. Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the oil recovery at the field scale. Several previous studies suggested that fingering can be ignored at the field scale because channeling (caused by heterogeneity) is dominant, but they missed the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. In our work, we consider that fingering and channeling coexist in the field across different scales, based on the fact that the heterogeneity increases with the scale. At the small-scale (e.g., lab-scale) where heterogeneity is small, fingering is dominant and causes oil bypassing. An effective-fingering model was developed to scale up fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, oil single-phase flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth factors of different regions, and they are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history-matches of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, fluid velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved at the lab-scale by considering relatively homogeneous cores. We extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatially accurate numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using gridblock sizes that are roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number for a gridblock at the field-scale affected by various heterogeneities. It is also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a synthetic field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. It is observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. "

                    "abstract": "Water soluble polymers have been used for decades as mobility control agents for tertiary recovery processes. Viscosity is conferred by the large hydrated size of the individual high molecular weight polymer molecules; their single-molecule hydrated size is so large that it can rival the diameters of the pore throats conducting the fluid, and it is widely understood that there are permeability limits below which solutions of such polymers cannot transport well. Delineating exactly where these limits are remains challenging, and operators are left to use whatever anecdotal evidence is available to decide whether to inject polymer, and, if so, what type and molecular weight to use. A rule of thumb is that when the permeability of a rock falls below 100 millidarcys, transport can be problematic. We have developed processing techniques for laboratory tests to condition polymer solutions for injection into reservoir carbonate cores with permeabilities below 10 millidarcys and median pore radii below one micron. Shearing and tight filtration were used to reduce the maximum size of polymers in solution while retaining as much viscosity as possible. Subsequent filtration was used to quantitatively assess the plugging behavior of the product solution across a range of pore sizes smaller than those which conduct in the rock sample. Coreflood injectivity tests revealed the onset of face plugging as a function of average polymer size. Co-solvent was shown to dramatically improve the transport of sulfonated polyacrylamides when face plugging did not occur, and those improvements were mirrored in benchtop filtration data. This improvement came despite equal-or-better viscosity in the polymer solution, demonstrating that the co-solvent did not reduce the polymer's hydrated size and therefore most likely weakens inter-molecular associations in solution. In sum, the data indicate that permeability loss occurred by two mechanisms: simple mechanical plugging and progressive adsorption, likely mediated by inter-molecular entanglements. These two permeability reduction mechanisms should be rectified by different means. "

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding is an enhanced oil recovery method (EOR) where water-soluble polymer is added to the injection brine. This increases brine viscosity and reduces water mobility, aiming to increase volumetric sweep and thus oil recovery. Selection and development of a production strategy for oil field is a complex task. Polymer properties bring additional complexity to this process and it is important that each of them is properly treated and considered. This paper discusses the selection of production strategy considering different approaches: (1) water flooding, (2) ideal polymer (only viscosifying effect of polymer) and (3) polymer flooding, including separately four of the most influencing polymer properties i.e. retention, viscoelasticity, salinity and degradation. The analysis is extended to a probabilistic point of view, where scenarios were generated combining geological and polymer uncertainties. Selected production strategies are compared to quantify the impact of each property on field indicators. Comparisons were made in terms of net present value (NPV), produced oil, injected and produced water, oil recovery factor and polymer mass. Two different situations were considered: (1) to optimize considering each property since beginning (design + control variables, meaning development, and management stages) and (2) considering design variables (development stage) for ideal polymer, optimizing only control variables (management stage) for each property. The methodology is applied to a synthetic field, based on characteristics of an offshore field with high permeability (∼1 000 mD) and containing heavy and viscous oil (∼100 cP, 14° API). Ranking the properties according to overall impact on the project NPV, it was found the impact of each variable in a descending order: degradation, salinity, viscoelasticity, and retention. Water and ideal polymer strategies limit indicators results, giving an idea of the performance of strategies. Considering the key polymer properties from the beginning of optimization process resulted in similar values in terms of NPV when compared with strategies that considered ideal polymer in the selection of project variables. Risk curves show that conclusions can be extended to a probabilistic point of view. The results allow a comprehensive understanding of the influence of each polymer property on selection of production strategy considering uncertainties. The results also show that it is possible to select a good strategy using Ideal polymer model. Finally, results show that strategies selected for water and for ideal polymer model act as lower and upper limits of performance for the field, giving valuable information to the decision maker, even before accurate data about polymer is available.

Production from the Greater Burgan began in 1946 from the Wara reservoir via primary recovery. Recently, field-wide waterflood as a secondary recovery mechanism has been implemented. The current insight on the potential of hybrid low salinity water and polymer flooding in the Greater Burgan is presented. The goal of the Greater Burgan Study team in this enhanced oil recovery (EOR) evaluation program was to compare the benefits of using low salinity waterflood (LSW) and low salinity polymer (LSP) injection as tertiary oil recovery methods in the Wara sandstone reservoir of the Greater Burgan field. The efficacy of low salinity and low salinity polymer injection has been investigated in the laboratory and by conducting a series of single-well chemical tracer (SWCT) tests in one Wara producer. In the field trial carried out on Well A, three separate determinations of residual oil saturation (Sor) were made. The first SWCT test measured waterflood Sor after injecting a slug of high salinity water (HSW) that is compositionally comparable to the produced water utilized field-wide for waterflooding operations. The second and third SWCT tests measured the remaining oil saturation after LSW and LSP, respectively. Laboratory corefloods were also performed to evaluate LSW and LSP recoveries and their impacts on injectivity. The injection water salinity, injection design, oil viscosity, and polymer viscosity used in the laboratory experiments were identical to those used in the field SWCT tests. These SWCT test trial results establish a baseline waterflood Sor (i.e., after high salinity water injection) and show that further reductions in Sor may be achieved with low salinity waterflooding and low salinity polymer injection. The laboratory results showed no plugging or injectivity issues during LSW or LSP corefloods. Overall, LSW and LSP were shown to be technically workable tertiary processes in the Greater Burgan. "

                    "abstract": "The super-giant offshore carbonate oil field started production in 1968 and has been under pattern water flood since 1982. The field is undergoing a major redevelopment utilizing artificial islands and maximum reservoir contact 10,000 ft horizontal wells in a 1:1 line drive. As part of the re-development, Chemical EOR (CEOR) is being assessed for potential application in one of the main oil producing reservoirs. This paper reports on laboratory results of a CEOR study addressing the major challenge of chemical retention in carbonate reservoirs and investigates the feasibility of increasing oil recovery through CEOR processes. In this paper, CEOR processes investigated include surfactant-polymer (SP) and alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) for temperature of 100°C, formation salinity of 200K ppm total dissolved solids, hardness of 15K ppm, and reservoir permeability of <10 mD. In the screening and optimization process, more than 100 surfactant formulations and 3,000 pipette tests at ambient pressure and reservoir temperature utilizing surrogate oil were completed to identify two potential formulations: a SP and an ASP which were stable under reservoir conditions. The polymer qualification includes the polymer rheology and transport tests in reservoir cores using different polymer molecules (HPAM, AMPS), pre-shearing rates, and co-solvent types and concentrations. The identified high-performance SP and ASP formulations were further tested in two live oil corefloods where oil recovery and retention were evaluated. A history match of the core flood experiments was performed and input data were obtained for large scale simulations. The chemical formulation design results showed that an SP formulation having high solubilization ratio can be prepared in Arabian Gulf seawater. Large-hydrophobe alkoxy carboxylate surfactant and sulfonate cosurfactant showed promising performance for the given harsh reservoir conditions. Polymer injectivity core flood tests were also performed to assess transport of the identified polymers. Results indicate that the pre-sheared viscous polymer solution transported without plugging or filtering out in a 1 -ft long 6 mD composite core. The live oil corefloods of the SP and ASP formulations resulted in an overall recovery factors of 97% and 93.5%, respectively. However, surfactant retention was high at 0.99 and 0.58 mg surfactant/g rock for the SP and ASP core floods under similar injected PV of chemicals. The analysis of the surfactant retention indicates phase trapping and adsorption on minerals are believed to be the dominant mechanisms for most of surfactant retained in the core. The current study represents a continued expansion of industry experience and includes the identification of two high-performance surfactant formulations which are stable and provide ultra-low IFT under the high temperature, high salinity, and high-hardness characteristic of Middle East carbonate reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "Reservoirs facing challenges such as high oil viscosity and high heterogeneity benefit from polymer flooding by decreasing unfavorable mobility ratios or improving crossflow. Despite this diversity of needs, polymer floods are often designed around a single point viscosity value, which doesn't account for variable shear rates in the porous media, in-situ viscosity, challenges with fluid injectivity, etc. Polymers have diverse rheological characteristics. For example, synthetic polymers like HPAM are elastic and can range in their degree of shear sensitivity, while biopolymers like scleroglucan are inelastic and highly shear-thinning. We generated laboratory data for two such polymers, scleroglucan and an Acrylamide-ATBS Co-Polymer. We developed parameters to describe their rheological characteristics for a variety of models, including shear thinning, shear thickening and preshearing. We then assessed the impact of these attributes on polymer flooding performance using UTCHEM, the University of Texas Chemical Flooding Reservoir Simulator. Polymer injectivity, viscosity, and shear rate were assessed for sensitivity to polymer rheology using simplified models of radial geometry. These results were correlated to laboratory experiments to ensure correct estimate of in-situ viscosities. Sensitivity to a variety of important parameters, including shear rate correction factor, simulation grid size, shear-thickening, and skin were also completed. A final sensitivity study was conducted using a heterogeneous reservoir model with the multiple patterns. Simulations using the simplified radial model and the heterogeneous, commercial scale model support the same conclusion: the specifics of polymer rheology can have a significant impact on polymer flooding performance, and polymer rheology should be considered an important design attribute along with injection viscosity and retention. We show that injection of an elastic, HPAM-based polymer may require higher injection pressure or lower rates than a highly shear-thinning, inelastic biopolymer like scleroglucan. We also demonstrate how the differences in rheology impact reservoir pressure, in-situ viscosity distribution, in situ shear-rate distribution and flow into various reservoir layers. "

                    "abstract": "Microemulsion phase behavior is crucial to surfactant flooding performance and design. In previous studies, analytical/numerical solutions for surfactant flooding were developed dependent on the classical theory of multicomponent/multiphase displacement and empirical microemulsion phase-behavior models. These phase-behavior models were derived from empirical correlations for component-partition coefficients or from the Hand-rule model (Hand 1930), which empirically represents the ternary-phase diagram. These models may lack accuracy or predictive abilities, which may lead to improper formulation design or unreliable recovery predictions. To provide a more-insightful understanding of the mechanisms of surfactant flooding, we introduced a novel microemulsion phase-behavior equation of state (EOS) dependent on the hydrophilic/lipophilic-difference (HLD) equation and the net-average curvature (NAC) model, which is called HLD-NAC EOS hereafter. An analytical model for surfactant flooding was developed dependent on coherence theory and this novel HLD-NAC EOS for two-phase three-component displacement. Composition routes, component profile along the core, and oil recovery can be determined from the analytical solution. The analytical solution was validated against numerical simulation as well as experimental study. This HLD-NAC EOS based analytical solution enables a systematic study of the effects of phase-behavior-dependent variables on surfactant-flooding performance. The effects of solution gas and pressure on microemulsion phase behavior were investigated. It was found that an increase of solution gas and pressure would lead to enlarged microemulsion bank and narrowed oil bank. For a surfactant formulation designed at standard conditions, the analytical solution was able to quantitatively predict its performance under reservoir conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Foam has been successfully used in the oil industry for conformance and mobility control in gas-injection processes. The efficiency of a foam-injection project must be assessed by means of numerical models. Although there are several foam-flow models in the literature, the prediction of foam behavior is an important issue that needs further investigation. In this paper, we estimate foam parameters and investigate foam behavior for a given range of water saturation by use of two local equilibrium foam models: the population balance assuming local equilibrium (LE) model and the University of Texas (UT) model. Our method uses an optimization algorithm to estimate foam-model parameters by matching the measured pressure gradient from steady-state foam-coreflood experiments. We calculate the effective foam viscosity and the water fractional flow by use of experimental data, and we then compare laboratory data against results obtained with the matched foam models to verify the foam parameters. Other variables, such as the foam texture and foam relative permeability, are used to further investigate the behavior of the foam during each experiment. We propose an improvement to the UT model that provides a better match in the high-quality regime by assuming resistance factor and critical water saturation as a linear function of the pressure gradient. Results show that the parameter-estimation method coupled with an optimization algorithm successfully matches the experimental data by use of both foam models. In the LE model, we observe different values of the foam effective viscosity for each pressure gradient caused by variations of foam texture and the shear-thinning viscosity effect. The UT model presents a constant effective viscosity for each pressure gradient; we propose the use of resistance factor and critical water saturation as a linear function of the pressure gradient to improve the match in the high-quality regime, when applicable.

                    "abstract": "In a conventional reservoir simulation, analytical well models relate well block pressure, wellbore pressure, fluid mobility, and geometric factors such as wellbore radius and grid size. Basically, fluid viscosity is assumed to be Newtonian in these models. Commercial reservoir simulators using these well models often predict unrealistic well injectivity in simulation of processes involving non-Newtonian fluids such as polymer solutions. Apparent viscosity of a polymer solution is a complicated function of flow velocity, polymer properties, permeability, porosity, salinity, etc. As the distance away from an injection well increases, flow velocity decreases; meanwhile, the apparent polymer viscosity changes drastically. For shear-thinning polymers, the average flow velocity in a well block is several orders of magnitude smaller than the flow velocity near the wellbore, especially when grid size is large. Using the average flow velocity for apparent viscosity calculation leads to an underestimate of well injectivity. Thus it is crucial to consider non-Newtonian effects in simulation of injectivity of polymer solutions. UTCHEM, a general purpose chemical flooding simulator developed at the University of Texas, uses a semi-analytical polymer injectivity model based on an extension of Peaceman's well model to non-Newtonian fluids. This model corrects the apparent viscosity in well index calculation and gives a more realistic estimate of polymer injectivity. However, the model needs to be programmed and implemented in a code. It is not practical for users of commercial simulators which do not have semi-analytical polymer injectivity model. Compared with UTCHEM, CMG-STARS, the thermal and advanced processes reservoir simulator developed by Computer Modeling Group, uses an apparent skin factor to account for non-Newtonian effects of power law fluids. The apparent skin factor can be used as an input parameter to the simulator. In this study, we revisited the analytical polymer injectivity model and proposed a general form for the calculation of apparent skin factor. The apparent skin factor is estimated using polymer rheological properties, grid size, wellbore radius, etc., and can apply to any polymer rheology. Simulation studies of polymer flooding cases were conducted to verify the concept of apparent skin factor. The results show that for shear-thinning polymers, the apparent skin factor can be estimated properly and correct the analytical well model to give close predictions compared to the semi-analytical polymer injectivity model and fine-grid simulation. The concept of apparent skin factor was proved to be useful for improving the accuracy of well injectivity calculations by commercial simulators. However, it is also worth pointing out that the apparent skin factor cannot be used for polymers which show shear-thickening behavior at high shear rates for cases of heterogeneous reservoir. "

For this purpose, we developed a novel technique by integrating a custom-built in-situ miniature fluid-injection module with a non-destructive high-resolution X-ray imaging system. Small cylindrical core samples (15–60 µm in diameter) were prepared from reservoir rocks using Focused-Ion Beam (FIB) milling technique. The pore network inside the samples were first characterized using ultra-high resolution three-dimensional images obtained at initial state by X-ray nano-tomography (Nano-CT) and FIB-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) techniques at the nano scale. The petrophysical parameters, including porosity, permeability, pore-size distribution, and organic content were computed for each sample using image analysis. We then performed series of imbibition experiments using brine, oil, and surfactant solutions on each core sample. We observed that both oil and brine phases spontaneously imbibe into the pore network of the rock samples at various quantities. We also, for the first time, examined fluid distribution in individual pores and found a complex wettability behavior at the pore scale in the reservoir rock samples. Three pore types were identified with water-wet, oil-wet, and fractionally-wet behaviors. This work opens a new path to developing an improved understanding of the pore-level physics involved in multi-phase flow and transport not only in tight rock samples but also in other nanoporous material used in different science and engineering applications.

Many methods have been developed to measure permeability, including well established and documented laboratory measurements on whole core and plugs, as well as analysis of formation test data, analysis of production and well tests data, acoustic and Stoneley Wave data analysis. In addition, obtaining permeability from NMR T1 or T2 has proven to be a cost effective method that can provide continuous permeability along a wellbore. This method relies on a transform that is applied to NMR well log data to obtain permeability. The NMR permeability transform requires calibration to fit local data and is usually developed based on measured data from representative cores from the reservoir of interest. We found that commonly used NMR permeability transforms do not work for our tight sandstones, and, hence we developed a general method to optimize permeability transform for any given reservoir from laboratory data and applied the method to a tight sand reservoir. Specifically, we report on:  The new transforms developed for the Middle East tight sandcan be used to calculate permeability along a wellbore from NMR wireline and/or LWD log data. The permeability results, the permeability profile, could then be used to evaluate the reservoir heterogeneity and select high grade zones for hydraulic fracturing.

                    "abstract": "Water management in mature waterflooded reservoirs is a top priority to push more oil out and control water production. Excess water production through fractures and high permeability thief zones is a growing concern for sweep efficiency and oil production. Gel treatment has been applied widely to plug thief zones and reduce excess water production to improve macroscopic sweep efficiency. Field studies demonstrated that gel treatments can be applied successfully in mature and fractured reservoirs to reduce unwanted fluid production to lower the operating cost causing premature well abandonment. The primary objectives of this work are to conduct laboratory work to understand the transport and propagation of microgel and develop a conformance control reservoir simulator to help screen oil reservoir targets for effective particle gel applications to improve sweep efficiency and reduce water production. These microgels can be injected as suspension in water into an injection well. Many experiments were performed to understand the transport mechanism of microgels through porous media and to identify the control variables. The lab data include oil recovery, water-cut, resistance factor, residual resistance factor, oil viscosities, gel concentrations, salinity, gel rheology, and gel strength. The success of gel treatment depends on the magnitude of permeability reduction and flow diversion. We have developed correlations for resistance factor, residual resistance factor and apparent viscosity as a function of gel strength, gel concentration, rock permeability, salinity, and flow rate. The models are validated against lab measurements and implemented into a reservoir simulator called UTGEL. Gel properties such as rheology and adsorption are also investigated. The mechanistic models and numerical tools developed will help select future conformance control candidates for a given field and optimize the gel chemistry and treatment. "

                    "abstract": "Unstable floods and resulting viscous fingers remain a big challenge for reservoir simulation as the gridblock size is usually many orders larger than the viscous finger wavelength. This problem becomes especially pronounced with increasing applications of polymer and other chemical floods in the development of heavy oil reservoirs. Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the waterflood oil recovery. Using extremely fine grid models with centimeters size is unrealistic for field-scale simulations. While some researchers disregard viscous fingering by claiming that channeling dominates at the large scale for heterogeneous reservoirs, they miss the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. To overcome this limitation, an effective-fingering model was developed to upscale fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, single phase oil flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth rates of different regions, which are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history match of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved in the lab scale by considering homogeneous cores, and we extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatial accuracy numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using fine gridblock sizes roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number valid for a gridblock at the field scale affected by various heterogeneities using the effective-fingering model. We also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. We observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. In summary, we developed an upscaling model that provides a fresh-new insight on how to simulate unstable water/polymer floods at the field scale, which effectively accounts for the interplay of viscous fingering and channeling.

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding has been commercially applied to a number of viscous oil fields in the past decade and gradually gained more popularity. Due to limited injectivity in viscous-oil reservoirs, a relatively low polymer viscosity is usually used to avoid excessive injection pressure. In such a case, mobility ratio of polymer solution to oil is much greater than one, which implies unstable flow and strong viscous fingering. Existing reservoir simulators lack the capability of modeling such a physical phenomenon. Since many viscous-oil reservoirs have high permeability contrast between layers, we are motivated to study, for the first time, the impact of crossflow between different layers considering the presence of viscous fingering. Numerical modeling polymer floods with crossflow in a layered viscous-oil reservoir is difficult due to two major challenges: first is how to correctly allocate flow rates from the wellbore to multiple layers; and second is how to capture the viscous fingering effect without using excessively fine grids. To address the first issue, we developed an implicit well-rate-allocation model based on the potential method, which fully couples all the wellbore segments of each well with reservoir gridblocks to ensure a physical wellbore pressure. To deal with the second challenge, we implemented the effective fingering model, which is an upscaling model that lumps all the viscous fingers in a coarse grid block into one fictitious finger to allow for accurate estimation of fingering strength and growth during unstable flows. Both models were validated individually against the analytical solution or experimental data. The integrative module including the two new capabilities was used to simulate a polymer flood following a waterflood in a layer-cake reservoir in North America with moderate oil viscosity. We observed the fast propagation of water fronts and small fingering fraction in high permeability layers during the waterflooding phase, indicating active channeling and viscous fingering. The subsequent polymer flooding minimized both factors of oil bypassing and led to stable flow and high sweep efficiency. Without the implicit well-rate-allocation model, crossflow was overestimated and wellbore pressures of different well blocks were not consistent. Without the effective-fingering model, oil recovery was overestimated due to the lack of accounting for viscous fingering. The simulation results indicated that polymer flooding improved both displacement and sweep efficiencies. The model has shown comprehensive capabilities in reservoir simulations of polymer floods including unstable floods and crossflows between layers. This is a major significance to optimization of non-thermal viscous-oil EOR projects and also making more informed operational decisions for field developments. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional fractional flow theories such as the Buckley-Leverett analysis have benefited reservoir engineers greatly for many decades. Although being simple, these analyses provide prompt and decent estimations of water breakthrough and oil bank height/duration in the experiments and the fields. However, their intrinsic inaccuracy in estimating unstable immiscible floods due to the existence of viscous fingering has long been ignored. With increasing non-thermal immiscible floods developed for heavy oil reservoirs, an essential improvement for such a theory is desirable. The intrinsic residual oil saturation can never be achieved for strong unstable immiscible floods within a finite time. The fraction of the bypassed oil at a time is highly dependent on the viscosity ratio, flow velocity, interfacial tension, wettability, permeability and the geometry of the rock. Extensive experimental data and numerical studies have indicated that the strength and growth rate of viscous fingering are correlated to a dimensionless number, i.e., the viscous finger number, which is an integration of those factors aforementioned. Such a discovery enables a quantitative establishment of two-phase pseudo relative permeabilities, which are functions of fluid saturations and the viscous finger number. The fractional flow for unstable floods can hence be obtained by use of such pseudo relative permeabilities. The new fractional flow theory extended from the Buckley-Leverett analysis was applied to several groups of heavy-oil water coreflood experiments under various conditions. The new fractional flow analysis was able to predict very well the breakthrough time and oil recovery of these experiments. We further applied the new fractional flow analysis to a slab experiment of viscous oil with a waterflood followed by a polymer flood, and achieved a very good agreement with the oil recovery data. The analysis reproduced that the water cut increased very rapidly and the remaining oil saturation was much larger than the intrinsic residual oil saturation after several pore volumes of waterflood. The subsequent polymer flood altered the pseudo relative permeability curves due to the change of viscosity ratio and brought in a considerable amount of mobile oil to be displaced. This process happens to be similar to the fractional flow of low-tension immiscible flow. Such a scenario is different from what the conventional fractional flow analysis suggests, which neglects the fact that the subsequent polymer flood is able to greatly improve the oil cut by mitigating the viscous fingers originally created by waterflood. The new theory has extended the original fractional flow theories to unstable immiscible floods, a major progress. It can also serve as a critical guideline to estimate and predict the water/polymer breakthrough and the oil production in viscous-oil benchscale experiments and field projects. "

Polymer rheology can also play an important role in affecting the fracture growth due to the dramatic variation of fluid velocity. However, current reservoir simulations for chemical flooding generally overlook the induced fracture, which may lead to inaccurate modeling of polymer floods. In this paper, we developed a new polymer-injection-induced fracture model based on the GdK fracture model, and implicitly coupled it to a general-purpose chemical flood simulator. Mathematical description of the fracture mechanics is presented with consideration of different polymer rheology. The new model is used to simulate polymer floods in a five-spot field. The fracture growth predicted by the new model is verified against a semi-analytical numerical fracture model. The simulation results using the new model indicate that the fracture growth has positive effects on improving injectivity, pressure drop, oil recovery, etc. Also, the simulations illustrate for the first time how polymer rheology affects fracture growth during polymer injection, e.g., without consideration of polymer shear-thickening can postpone the prediction of fracture initiation. The simulations successfully explain why polymer can be economically injected in real polymer fields. The new simulator can be used to optimize polymer floods concerning polymer injectivity, impact of fracture growth on sweeping efficiency, flow out of zone, and others. "

Generally, more oil is recovered when polymer solution is injected for a longer time. For a real project, optimization of field operations usually requires consideration of economic indicators, such as net present value (NPV) as objective function so polymer and other costs are included in the decision 3process. Several commercial and in-house simulators have the capability to model polymer flooding for the optimization purposes. In this paper, we present the numerical modeling of polymer retention and the reversibility, inaccessible pore volume, shape of the curve of viscosity vs. polymer concentration, salinity, permeability reduction, non-Newtonian behavior and degradation, etc. We first tested these models in simple benchmark cases, and then applied them to two synthetic field cases. The goal is to understand the impact of each polymer property on field performance indicators, especially NPV. The synthetic fields represent target Brazil oil fields which have high average permeability with heavy oil (~14° API). Retention of polymer, salinity, polymer rheology and degradation can decrease NPV by up to 25%. Permeability reduction, adsorption reversibility, inaccessible pore volume and selection of a correlation curve for the function of viscosity vs. concentration can influence NPV by less than 3%. Identification of the crucial polymer properties/simulation parameters helps with the decision for key laboratory tests and reducing uncertainties associated with each. This information also helps on the selection of simulation models and key sensitivity parameters where unimportant parameters can be neglected in simulation studies. "

                    "abstract": "The upscaling of unstable immiscible flow remains an unsolved challenge for the oil industry. The absence of a reliable upscaling approach hinders effective reservoir simulation and optimization of heavy-oil recoveries by use of waterflood, polymer flood, and other chemical floods, which are inherently unstable processes. The difficulty in scaling up unstable flow lies in estimating the propagation of fingers smaller than the gridblock size. Using classical relative permeabilities obtained from stable flow analysis can lead to incorrect oil recovery and pressure drop in reservoir simulations. Extensive experimental data in water-wet cores indicate that the heavy-oil recovery by waterfloods and polymer floods has a power-law correlation with a dimensionless number (named “viscous-finger number” in this paper), a combination of viscosity ratio, capillary number, permeability, and the cross-sectional area of the core. On the basis of the features of unstable immiscible floods, an effective-fingering model is developed in this paper. A porous-medium domain is dynamically identified as three effective regions, which are two-phase flow, oil single-phase flow, and bypassed-oil region, respectively. Flow functions are derived according to effective flows in these regions. Model parameters represent viscous-fingering strength and growth rates. The new model is capable of history matching a set of heavy-oil waterflood corefloods under different conditions. Model parameters obtained from the history match also have power-law correlations with the viscous-finger number. This model is applicable to water-wet reservoirs; it has not been tested for mixed-wet and oil-wet systems, low-interfacial-tension (IFT) environments, low permeability, and heavy-oil reservoirs with free gas cap. In reservoir simulations, having such a correlation enables the estimation of model parameters in any gridblock of the reservoir by knowing the local viscous-finger number. The model was first applied to a heavy-oil field case with channelized permeability by waterfloods. Simulation results with the new model indicated that viscous fingering strengthened the channeling. Also, the new model shows that a lower injection rate leads to a higher oil recovery. In contrast, oil recovery in waterflooding of viscous oils is overpredicted by classical simulation methods that do not incorporate viscous fingering properly. We further showed that coarse grid simulations with the new model were able to obtain saturation and pressure maps consistent with fine-grid simulations. The new model was then used to model a real field case in the Pelican Lake heavy-oil field. It was able to match the field-production data without major adjustment of reservoir/fluid properties from the literature, showing its competence in capturing subgrid viscous-fingering effects. Overall, the new model shows encouraging capability to simulate unstable water and polymer floods in heavy-oil reservoirs, and hence can facilitate the optimization of heavy-oil enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) projects.

                    "abstract": "Chemical flood reservoir simulators developed based on component partitioning model or empirical phase behavior model lack the effects of physical properties such as surfactant structure and oil properties i.e. equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) on microemulsion phase behavior. Hence, these simulators have limited function in helping formulation design. A typical empirical microemulsion phase behavior model is the Hand's model that is used in UTCHEM, a benchmark chemical flood compositional simulator. However, it needs several matching parameters to fit phase behavior experiments and requires iterative calculations to solve phase compositions. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a chemical flood simulator with a more efficient and physics-based phase behavior model. This work incorporates a physics based HLD-NAC equation of state (EOS) into UTCHEM. A non-iterative flash calculation algorithm based on HLD-NAC microemulsion EOS is developed, which uses simple equations to represent plait point, binodal curve, and tie-lines. Input model parameters include quantitatively characterized physical properties, such as oil EACN, reservoir temperature, surfactant structure properties (head area and tail length), and optimum solubilization ratio. Therefore, the effects of these parameters on oil recovery can be systemically studied. Coreflood simulation results are validated against the Hand's model. Compared to the Hand's model which requires at least 5 matching parameters and with limited predictability, the HLD-NAC EOS can reproduce microemulsion phase behavior with surfactant tail length as the only fitting parameter. Comparing coreflood simulations using the HLD-NAC model and the Hand's model shows that the same oil recovery curves are obtained when slug at optimum salinity is injected. However, for corefloods using a salinity gradient design, HLD-NAC model predicts higher oil recovery than the Hand's model. The reasons for the differences are analyzed by examining the simulated solubilization ratios and ternary phase diagrams at different salinities. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the HLD-NAC model improves the phase behavior computational efficiency by approximately 65%. The effect of live oil at reservoir pressure is also investigated. Results indicate shifted optimal salinity and solubilization ratio due to solution gas and pressure lead to larger microemulsion bank. Owing to the physical significance, simplicity, and computational efficiency of the HLD-NAC EOS, this novel chemical flooding simulator proves to be a fast and promising tool to speed up surfactant screening process and helping chemical formulation development and injection designs.

Injecting Polymer (P), surfactant/polymer (SP), and alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) are techniques for improving sweep and displacement efficiencies with the aim of improving oil production in both secondary and tertiary floods. There has been great interest in chemical flooding recently for different challenging situations. These include high temperature reservoirs, formations with extreme salinity and hardness, naturally fractured carbonates, and sandstone reservoirs with heavy and viscous crude oils. More oil reservoirs are reaching maturity where secondary polymer floods and tertiary surfactant methods have become increasingly important. This significance has added to the industry's interest in using reservoir simulators as tools for reservoir evaluation and management to minimize costs and increase the process efficiency. Reservoir simulators with special features are needed to represent coupled chemical and physical processes present in chemical EOR processes. The simulators need to be first validated against well controlled lab and pilot scale experiments to reliably predict the full field implementations. The available data from laboratory scale include 1) phase behavior and rheological data; and 2) results of secondary and tertiary coreflood experiments for P, SP, and ASP floods under reservoir conditions, i.e. chemical retentions, pressure drop, and oil recovery.

The results of this benchmark comparison will be utilized to improve chemical design for field-scale studies using commercial simulators. The benchmark tests illustrate the potential of commercial simulators for chemical flooding projects and provide a comprehensive table of strengths and limitations of each simulator for a given chemical EOR process. Mechanistic simulations of chemical EOR processes will provide predictive capability and can aid in optimization of the field injection projects. The objective of this paper is not to compare the computational efficiency and solution algorithms; it only focuses on the process modeling comparison. "

                    "abstract": "Single-well-partitioning-tracer tests (SWTTs) are used to measure the saturation of oil or water near a wellbore. If used before and after injection of enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) fluids, they can evaluate EOR flood performance in a so-called one-spot pilot. Four alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) one-spot pilots were recently completed in Kuwait’s Sabriyah-Mauddud (SAMA) reservoir, a thick, heterogeneous carbonate operated by Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). UTCHEM (Delshad et al. 2013), the University of Texas chemical-flooding reservoir simulator, was used to interpret results of two of these one-spot pilots performed in an unconfined zone within the thick SAMA formation. These simulations were used to design a new method for injecting partitioning tracers for one-spot pilots. The recommended practice is to inject the tracers into a relatively uniform confined zone, but, as seen in this work, that is not always possible, so an alternative design was needed to improve the accuracy of the test. The simulations showed that there was a flow-conformance problem when the partitioning tracers were injected into a perforated zone without confinement after the viscous ASP and polymer-drive solutions. The water-conveyed-tracer solutions were being partially diverted outside of the ASP-swept zone where they contacted unswept oil. Because of this problem, the initial interpretation of the performance of the chemicals was pessimistic, overestimating the chemical residual oil saturation (ROS) by up to 12 saturation units. Additional simulations indicated that the oil saturation in the ASP-swept zone could be properly estimated by avoiding the post-ASP waterflood and injecting the post-ASP tracers in a viscous polymer solution rather than in water. An ASP one-spot pilot using the new SWTT design resulted in an estimated ROS of only 0.06 after injection of chemicals (Carlisle et al. 2014). These saturation values were obtained by history matching tracer-production data by use of both traditional continuously-stirred-tank (CSTR) models and compositional, reactive-transport reservoir models. The ability of the simulator to model every phase of the one-spot pilot operation was crucial to the insight of modified SWTT design. The waterflood, first SWTT, ASP flood, and the final SWTT were simulated using a heterogeneous permeability field representative of the Mauddud formation. Laboratory data, field-ASP quality-control information, and injection strategy were all accounted for in these simulations. We describe the models, how they were used, and how the results were used to modify the SWTT design. We further discuss the implications for other SWTTs. The advantage of mechanistic simulation of multiple aspects of a one-spot pilot is an important theme of this study. Because the pore space investigated by the SWTTs can be affected by the previously injected EOR fluids (and vice versa), these interactions should be accounted for. This simulation approach can be used to identify and mitigate design problems during each phase of a challenging one-spot pilot. "

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding is one of the most widely used chemical enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) methods because of its simplicity and low cost. To achieve high oil recoveries, large quantities of polymer solution are often injected through a small wellbore. Sometimes, the economic success of the project is only feasible when injection rate is high for high-viscosity solution. However, injection of viscous polymer solutions has been a concern for the field application of polymer flooding. The pressure increase in polymer injectors can be attributed to (1) formation of an oil bank, (2) polymer rheology (shear-thickening behavior near wellbore), and (3) plugging of the reservoir pores by insoluble polymer molecules or suspended particles in the water. In this paper, a new model to history match field injection-rate/pressure data is proposed. The pertinent equations for deep-bed filtration and external-cake buildup in radial coordinates were coupled to the viscoelastic polymer rheology to capture important mechanisms. Radial coordinates were selected to minimize the velocity/shear-rate errors caused by gridblock size in the Cartesian coordinates. The filtration theory was used and the field data history matched successfully. Systematic simulations were performed, and the impact of adsorption (retention), shear thickening, deep-bed filtration, and external-cake formation was investigated to explain the well-injectivity behavior of polymer. The simulation results indicate that the gradual increase in bottomhole pressure (BHP) during early times is attributed to the shear-thickening rheology at high velocities experienced by viscoelastic hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymers around the wellbore and the permeability reduction caused by polymer adsorption and internal filtration of undissolved polymer. However, the linear impedance during external-cake growth is responsible for the sharper increase in injection pressure at the later times. One can use the proposed model to calculate the injectivity of the polymer-injection wells, understand the contribution of different phenomena to the pressure rise in the wells, locate the plugging or damage that may be caused by polymer, and accordingly design the chemical stimulation if necessary.

                    "abstract": "This study describes a general four-phase model developed for gas/oil/water/microemulsion (ME) coexisting at local equilibrium. The original framework of a chemical reservoir simulator is used to implement the model. This model represents a new method to couple the black-oil model with surfactant-phase behavior [i.e., the Hand (1939) rule]. The Hand (1939) rule is used to capture the equilibrium among surfactant, oil, and water species as a function of salinity and species concentrations for oil/water/ME phases. The interphase-mass transfer between gas/oil in the presence of the ME phase is calculated at the equilibrium between phases. For this purpose, a new volume-balance equation is derived to consider the pressure equation for compressible and real mixing in such a model. Hence, the pressure equation is derived by extending the black-oil model to a pseudocompositional model for a wide range of components (water, oil, surfactant, polymer, anion, cation, alcohol, and gas). Mass-balance equations are then solved for the components to calculate the concentration. Finally, we implemented the coupled surfactant and black-oil phase-behavior models and the fluid-flow formulations in an implicit-pressure/explicit-concentration (IMPEC) chemical-flooding simulator: UTCHEM (2011) four-phase. The results were verified against existing reservoir simulators for two different three-phase test cases comprising gas/oil/water and oil/water/ME. Then, the performance of the model in the presence of four phases was tested and validated against coreflood experimental data. The results showed that the new phase behavior and the fluid-flow equations are consistent with three-phase reservoir simulators for the case studies. In addition, the findings of this work can be used to model and capture the mechanisms behind processes such as micellar slug foam and alkaline and surfactant flooding into saturated (gas cap) reservoirs as well as alternating or coinjection of surfactant and gas processes. Modeling of such processes is far from satisfactory in existing phase behavior and fluid-flow simulators. "

The effect of changes in the aqueous composition on the relative permeability is commonly neglected in both experiments and models and may lead to erroneous predictions of reservoir performance. Therefore, we have developed a general framework to calculate aqueous-composition- dependent relative permeability. The expected relative permeability must be continuous and cover the entire saturation and composition space for the desired process, pressure, and temperature. The proposed model (UTPGE model) acts as a unifying bridge among thermodynamics, petrophysics, geochemistry, and electrolyte. It can seamlessly be used to evaluate aqueous relative permeability in oil recovery and hydrology applications. The proposed framework is relative and provides the relative permeability upon two set of measured input relative permeability curves. We select the UTKR3P model as the reference multiphase relative permeability model. One thermodynamic property of the electrolyte system must represent the compositional effect. We select the aqueous phase molar Gibbs free energy (GFE) to represent the bulk property of the electrolyte system. The interface properties, if required, are presented by aqueous- liquid or -gas interfacial tension. Phase GFE is calculated from the aqueous speciation results, i.e. species activity and concentration.

                    "abstract": "Conformance control has long been a compelling subject in improving waterflood oil recovery. By blocking the areas previously swept by water, subsequently injected water is allowed to access the remaining unswept portions of the reservoir and thereby increase the ultimate oil recovery. One technique that has recently received a great deal of attention in achieving the so-called \"in-depth water shut-off' is preformed gel injection. However, processing and predicting the performance of these gels in complex petroleum reservoirs is extremely challenging. As target reservoirs for gel treatments are mainly those with fractures or ultra-high permeability streaks, the ability to model the propagation of gels through a fractured reservoir was considered as a new challenge for this research study. The primary objectives of this work are to conduct laboratory work to understand the transport and propagation of microgel through fractures and develop conformance control schemes using a reservoir simulator to help in screening oil reservoir targets for effective particle gel applications to improve sweep efficiency and reduce the water production. Fractured experiments using transparent apparatus were performed to observe gel transport in matrix and fractures. The same set up was used to observe the effects of gel strength, gel particle size, and fracture size on gel transport. Numerical simulation of fluid-flow in fractured reservoirs can be computationally difficult and time consuming due to the large contrast between matrix and fracture permeabilities and the extremely small fracture apertures and the need for using unstructured gridding. In this work, a model that accurately represents the complex reservoir features, chemical properties, and displacement mechanisms is developed. The five-spot transparent fracture experiments allowed us to identify the transport mechanisms of microgels through fractures-conduits and also the control variables. With an integration of comprehensive gel transport modules and a novel Embedded Discrete Fracture Modeling (EDFM), gel rheological and transport properties of shear thinning viscosity, adsorption, resistance factors, and residual resistance factor, using multiple sets of fractures with dip angles and orientations were captured. The models were validated against lab measurements and implemented into a reservoir simulator called UTGEL. The mechanistic models and numerical tool developed will help to select future conformance control candidates for a given field and to optimize the gel chemistry and treatment. "

                    "abstract": "Although geochemical reactions are the fundamental basis of the alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding, their importance is commonly overlooked and not fully assessed. Common assumptions made when modeling geochemical reactions in ASP floods include: 1) ideal solution (i.e., using molalities rather than ion activities) for the water and aqueous geochemical species 2) limiting the number of reactions (i.e., oil/alkali and alkali consumptions) rather than including the entire thermodynamically-equilibrated system 3) ignoring the effect of temperature and pressure on reactions 4) local equilibrium ignoring the kinetics. To the best of our knowledge, the significance of these assumptions has never been discussed in the literature. In this paper we investigate the importance of geochemical reactions during alkaline/surfactant/polymer floods using a comprehensive tool in the sense of surfactant/soap phase behavior as well as geochemistry. We coupled the United States Geological Survey (USGS) state-of-the-art geochemical tool, with 3D flow and transport chemical flooding module of UTCHEM. This geochemical module includes several thermodynamic databases with various geochemical reactions, such as ion speciation by applying several ion-association aqueous models, mineral, solid-solution, surface-complexation, and ion-exchange reaction. It has capabilities of saturation index calculation, reversible and irreversible reactions, kinetic reaction, mixing solutions, inverse modeling and includes impacts of temperature and pressure on reaction constants and solubility products. The chemical flood simulator has a three phase (water, oil, microemulsion) phase behavior package for the mixture of surfactant/soap, oil, and water as a function of surfactant/soap, salinity, temperature, and co-solvent concentration. Hence, the coupled software package provides a comprehensive tool to assess the significance of geochemical assumptions typically imposed in modeling ASP floods. Moreover, this integrated tool enables modeling of variations in mineralogy present in reservoir rocks. We parallelized the geochemistry module of this coupled simulator for large-scale reservoir simulations. Our simulation results show that the assumption of ideal solution overestimates ASP oil recovery. Assuming only a subset of reactions for a coupled system is not recommended, particularly when a large number of geochemical species is involved, as is the case in realistic applications of ASP. Reservoir pressure has a negligible effect but temperature has a significant impact on geochemical calculations. Although mineral reaction kinetics is largely a function of the temperature and in-situ water composition, some general conclusions can be drawn as follows: to a good approximation, minerals with slow rate kinetic reaction (e.g., quartz) can be excluded when modeling ASP laboratory floods. However, minerals with fast rate kinetic reactions (e.g., calcite) must be included when modeling lab results. On the other hand, in modeling field-scale applications, local equilibrium assumption (LEA) can be applied for fast rate kinetic minerals, whereas kinetics should be used for slow rate kinetic minerals.

Unfavorable microemulsion viscosity can lead to high chemical retention, low oil recovery, and overall unfavorable performance across all modes. Controlling microemulsion properties is important in conventional approaches like surfactant-polymer (SP) and alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding, in addition to new applications like gravity stable displacements, spontaneous imbibition in fractured carbonates and unstable floods of viscous oil. Despite the central importance, microemulsion viscosity and rheology remain poorly understood. This paper describes the results of an extensive experimental microemulsion study. We evaluated the effect of polymer on microemulsion viscosity in different microemulsion phase types (i.e. oil in water, bi-continuous, water in oil emulsions). We measured microemulsion viscosities across a broad salinity range for several crudes from light (API >30°) to heavy oils (API<14°) and observed Newtonian rheology for all phase types. The effect of cosolvents on microemulsion viscosity was also evaluated. Finally, we evaluated microemulsions with and without alkali to help understand potential differences between ASP and SP microemulsions. We include many observations consistent with earlier literature using recently developed surfactants and report the microemulsion viscosity details for many high performance surfactant formulations across a wide range of conditions. We have also describe several observations, including polymer decreasing the required time to achieve equilibrium in microemulsion pipettes and the qualitative change in microemulsion behavior with and without polymer in Windsor Type III microemulsions.

                    "abstract": "Preformed particle gels (PPG) have been successfully applied as a plugging agent to solve the conformance problem in fractured reservoirs. They are injected to plug fractures and then divert displacing fluid into poorly swept zones and areas. However, PPG propagation and plugging mechanisms through open fractures have not been studied thoroughly. This paper investigated the influence of some factors (particle size, brine concentration, heterogeneity, injection flow rate, and brine salinity) on gel injectivity and plugging performance for water flow through opening fractures. Five-foot tubes were used to mimic opening fractures. Three models were designed to gain understanding on how fracture geometry and PPG properties affect gel injection and plugging efficiency, including (1) single fracture with uniform fracture width, (2) single fracture with different widths, and (3) two parallel fractures with different width ratios between each other. Results from single uniform fracture experiments showed that PPG injection pressure was more sensitive to gel strength than gel particle size. When large PPG size and high gel strength were used, high injection pressure and large injection pore volume were required for PPG and brine to reach fracture outlets. Results from single heterogeneous fracture model experiments showed PPG injection pressure increased as the fracture heterogeneity in sections increased. Particle gel accumulated at the choke point within each fracture and caused injection pressure to increase accordingly. Furthermore, results showed that having a lower salinity within a fracture, which was less than the brine salinity that was used to prepare PPG, would improve the PPG plugging efficiency for water flow. Parallel fracture models results showed that when weak PPG was used, a large volume of PPG flowed into a large fracture width and a small portion of the gel particle volume flowed into small fracture width. However, with increased gel strength and fracture width ratio, PPG only flowed through larger fracture widths. This paper demonstrates important impact elements of gel propagation and water flow for different opening fracture situations. "

This paper uses the physics based Hydrophilic Lipophilic Difference (HLD) Net Average Curvature (NAC) model, and comprehensively demonstrated its capabilities in predicting the optimum formulation and microemulsion phase behavior based on the ambient conditions and surfactant structures. By using HLD equation and quantitatively characterized parameters, four optimum surfactant formulations are designed for target reservoir with high accuracy compared to experimental results. The microemulsion phase behavior is further predicted, and well matched the measured equilibrium interfacial tension. Its predictability is then reinforced by comparing to the empirical Hand's rule phase behavior model. Surfactant flooding sandpack laboratory tests are also interpreted by UTCHEM chemical flooding simulator coupled with the HLD-NAC phase behavior model. The results indicate the significance of HLD-NAC equation of state in not only shorten the surfactant screening processes for formulators, but also predicting microemulsion phase behavior based on surfactant structure.

                    "abstract": "Upscaling of unstable immiscible flow remains an unsolved challenge for the oil industry. The absence of a reliable upscaling approach greatly hinders the effective reservoir simulation and optimization of heavy oil recoveries using waterflood, polymer flood and other chemical floods, which are inherently unstable processes. The difficulty in upscaling unstable flow lies in estimating the propagation of fingers smaller than the gridblock size. Using classical relative permeabilities obtained from stable flow analysis can lead to incorrect oil recovery and pressure drop in reservoir simulations. In a recent study based on abundant experimental data, it is found that the heavy-oil recovery by waterfloods and polymer floods has a power-law correlation with a dimensionless number (named viscous finger number in this paper), which is a combination of viscosity ratio, capillary number, permeability, and the cross-section area of the core. Based upon this important finding as well as the features of unstable immiscible floods, an effective-finger model is developed in this paper. A porous medium domain is dynamically identified as three effective zones, which are two-phase flow zone, oil single-phase flow zone, and bypassed oil (isolated oil island) zone, respectively. Flow functions are derived according to effective flows in these zones. This new model is capable of history-matching a set of heavy-oil waterflood corefloods under different viscosity ratios and injection rates. Model parameters obtained from the history match also have a power-law correlation with the viscous finger number. The build-up of this correlation contains reasonable physical meanings to quantitatively characterize the upscaled behavior of viscous fingering effects. Having such a correlation enables the estimation of model parameters in any gridblock of the reservoir by knowing the local viscous finger number in reservoir simulations. The model is applied to several heavy-oil field cases with waterfloods and polymer floods with different heterogeneities. Oil recovery in water flooding of viscous oils is overpredicted by classical simulation methods which do not incorporate viscous fingering properly. Simulation results indicate that the new model reasonably differentiates the oil recoveries at different viscous finger numbers, e.g., lower injection rate leads to higher oil recovery. In contrast, classical simulations obtain close oil recoveries under different injection rates or degrees of polymer shear-thinning, which is apparently incorrect for unstable floods. Moreover, coarse-grid simulations using the new model are able to obtain consistent saturation and pressure maps with fine-grid simulations when the correlation lengths are not smaller than the coarse gridblock size. Furthermore, it is well captured by the model that the shear-shinning polymer solution can strengthen the fingering in high-permeability regions due to increased capillary number and viscosity ratio, which is not observed in waterflood. As a whole, the new model shows encouraging capability to simulate unstable water and polymer floods in heavy oil reservoirs, and hence can facilitate the optimization of heavy-oil EOR projects. "

The implicit-texture models all implicitly assume local equilibrium (LE) between the processes of foam creation and destruction. In published studies most population-balance models predict rapid attainment of local-equilibrium as well, and some have been recast in LE versions. In this paper we compare population-balance and implicit-texture (IT) models in two ways. First, we show the equivalence of the two approaches by deriving explicitly the foam texture and foam-coalescence-rate function implicit in the IT models, and then show its similarity to that in population-balance models. Second, we compare the models based on their ability to represent a set of N2 and CO2 steady-state foam experiments and discuss the corresponding parameters of the different methods. Each of the IT models examined was equivalent to the LE formulation of a population-balance model with a lamella-destruction function that increases abruptly in the vicinity of the limiting capillary pressure Pc*, as in current population-balance models. The relation between steady-state foam texture and water saturation or capillary pressure implicit in the IT models is essentially the same as that in the population-balance models. The IT and population-balance models match the experimental data presented equally well. The IT models examined allow for flexibility in making the abruptness of the coalescence rate near Pc* an adjustable parameter. Some allow for coarse foam to survive at high capillary pressure, and allow for a range of power-law non-Newtonian behavior in the low-quality regime. Thus the IT models that incorporate an abrupt change in foam properties near a given water saturation can be recast as LE versions of corresponding population-balance models with a lamella-destruction function similar to those in current PB models. The trends in dimensionless foam texture implicit in the IT models is similar to that in the PB models. In other words, both types of model, at least in the LE approximation, equally honor the physics of foam behavior in porous media. "

Because the results depend on many variables such as the initial oil saturation, rock characteristics and polymer characteristics, such experiments must be performed at reservoir conditions and at controlled capillary numbers and so forth to measure the reduction that applies to field polymer floods. Furthermore, a mechanistic model is needed to scale up the laboratory coreflood results to the field.

                    "abstract": "In the electrical-Joule-heating process, the reservoirs are heated in situ by dissipation of electrical energy to reduce the viscosity of oil. In principle, electrical current passes through the reservoir fluids mostly because of the electrical conductivity of saturated fluids such as saline water. The flow of electrical current through the reservoir raises the heat in the reservoir and thereby dramatically reduces the oil viscosity. In this process, electrical current can flow between electrical-potential sources (electrodes) in wells, and then electrical energy is dissipated to generate the heat. Therefore, the regions around the electrodes in (or around) the wells are extremely heated. Because the wells act as line sources for the electrical potential, greater heating takes place near the wellbore, causing possible vaporization of water in that region. Because steam has very-low electrical conductivity, it can reduce the efficiency of this process significantly. In this process electrical conductivity plays a very important role. To increase efficiency of this type of heating process, the presence of optimum saline-water saturation is an essential factor. To model the electrical Joule heating in the presence of multiphase-fluid flow, we use three Maxwell classical electromagnetism equations. These equations are simplified and assumed for low frequency to obtain the conservation of the electrical-current equation and Ohm's law. The conservation of electrical current and Ohm's law are implemented by use of a finite-difference method in a four-phase chemical-flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM 2011.7). The Joule-heating rate caused by dissipation of electrical energy is calculated and added to the energy equation as a source term. The formulation and implementation of electrical heating are validated against a reference analytical solution and verified with a reservoir simulator. A typical-reservoir model is built, and constant electrical potential with alternating current is applied to the model to study the efficiency of the electrical-heating process properly. The efficiency of this process is evaluated in the presence of water-saturated fractures and evaporation effect. Results illustrate that water saturation in the presence of fractures and electrical conductivity of saturated rock have an important effect on the Joule-heating process. The importance of the fractures saturated by saline water and operation of such processes below the boiling point are key findings in this paper to obtain high recovery in comparison with other conventional-thermal-recovery methods.

                    "abstract": "Mechanistic simulation of alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding considers chemical reactions between the alkali and the oil to form in-situ soap and reactions between the alkali and the minerals and brine. A comprehensive mechanistic modeling of such process remains a challenge, mainly caused by the complicated ASP phase behavior and the complexity of geochemical reactions that occur in the reservoir. Because of the lack of the microemulsion phase and/or lack of reactions that may lead to the consumption of alkali and resulting lag in the pH, a simplified ASP phase behavior is often used. A state-of-the-art geochemical package, IPhreeqc, of the United States Geological Survey was coupled with UTCHEM, an in-house research chemical-flooding reservoir simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin (UT), for a robust, flexible, and accurate integrated tool to mechanistically model ASP floods. UTCHEM has a comprehensive three-phase (water, oil, microemulsion) flash package for the mixture of surfactant and soap as a function of salinity, temperature, and cosolvent concentration. Through this integrated tool, we are able to simulate homogeneous and heterogeneous (mineral dissolution/precipitation), irreversible, surface complexation, and ion exchange reactions under nonisothermal, nonisobaric, and both local-equilibrium and kinetic conditions. Italic words are defined in Appendix A. IPhreeqc has rich databases of chemical species and also the flexibility to include the alkaline reactions required for modeling ASP floods. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the important aspects of ASP flooding are considered. An algorithm is presented for modeling the geochemistry in an implicit-in-pressure-and-explicit-in-concentration solution algorithm. Finally, we show how to apply the integrated tool, UTCHEM-IPHreeqc, to match three different reaction-related chemical-flooding processes: ASP flooding in an acidic active crude oil, ASP flooding in a nonacidic crude oil, and alkaline/cosolvent/polymer flooding.

                    "abstract": "Compositional simulation of surfactant flooding highly depends on accurate modeling of surfactant/oil/brine microemulsion phase behavior. This paper introduces a physics-based Hydrophilic–Lipophilic Difference (HLD) equation and the Net-Average Curvature (NAC) called thereafter HLD–NAC equation of state to model the phase behavior of surfactant/crude oil/brine systems. A non-iterative and physics-based algorithm is developed and validated by modeling the solubilization ratio curves and phase volume fraction of different microemulsion systems. The HLD values are calculated by the natural logarithm of salinity over optimum salinity when lacking of oil hydrophobicity and surfactant Characteristic curvature information. Together with lab measured head area of per surfactant molecule, the HLD–NAC model reproduces the microemulsion phase behavior of various formulations for surfactant flooding with only one fitting parameter, the length constant L, which physically represents the surfactant tail length size. Modeling results show that the fitted parameter increases with the surfactant or surfactant mixture tail length in the formulation. Moreover, the length parameter determined from one system can be readily applied to other systems, indicating the physical significance of the HLD–NAC model, which can to some extent predict the performance of one surfactant in various systems. The fitted length parameter for formulations with alcohol is underestimated because of this paper assuming all alcohol partition on the interface leading to overestimated interfacial area. The effect of cosolvent partitioning on the micelle structure and phase behavior modeling will be demonstrated in future studies. In this paper, the HLD–NAC equation of state is proved to be a simple and robust tool for modeling phase behavior of surfactant/crude oil/brine systems. The HLD–NAC model can shorten the surfactant screening process hence help chemical EOR formulation design and optimization, and can also be used in compositional chemical flooding reservoir simulation to improve the predictability of surfactant floods.

                    "abstract": "Excess water production has long been considered a major problem leading to the life-shortening of oil and gas wells and operational problems. High-permeability streaks, fractures, conduits, and fracture-like features can expedite an undesirable water channeling and early water breakthrough during water flooding. Preformed particle gel (PPG) is one of the commercial gels invented exclusively to plug such features to reduce excess water production, improve sweep efficiency, and increase oil production. This paper reports the results of laboratory experiments that studied the PPG's injection and placement mechanism through Super-K permeability cores to reduce unwanted water production and increase oil recovery. Extensive experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the sand permeability, PPG size, concentration, and water salinity on the PPG injection process, passing criteria, and plugging efficiency to water flow. A two foot sand pack model with four pressure taps was designed to monitor PPG transport and plugging performance. The results showed that the PPG propagated deep into the sand pack. PPG's in-depth permeability reduction to the core was dependent on the PPG size, strength, concentration, and sand permeability. Fully swollen gel particles had better injectivity than partially swollen particles with a larger diameter size; particle strength was more dominant in influencing particle movement than was particle size. The injection pressure increased as the PPG concentration, water salinity, and gel particle size increased. A large injection pore volume was required for the PPGs to be produced at effluent when both the water salinity and particle size were increased and when the PPGs concentration decreased. PPG transport through Super-K permeability sand exhibited three patterns of injection processes based on both the threshold pressure and the injection pressure measurements across the sand pack cores: low gel particle retention and pass; high gel particle retention and pass; and high gel particle retention, breaking, and pass. After the PPG injection process was completed, cycles of saline water were injected into the sand pack to test the PPG's resistance to water flow. The PPG's blocking efficiency to water flow increased as the PPG strength, size, and concentration increased. The PPG placement mechanism, such as washout, was also found to considerably affect the water injection flow processes. The results of this laboratory experiment will aid in the selection of future conformance control candidates and also optimize the particle gel treatment design for large-scale field projects. "

                    "abstract": "A study involving laboratory experiments and reservoir simulations of gas and chemical EOR processes was performed to evaluate the EOR viability in the Mauddud reservoir of the Sabiriyah field (SAMA) in Kuwait. The subject reservoir has been under pattern waterflooding for more than 10 years. Positive response with an increase in overall oil-rate was observed during the waterflooding period until recently several wells started water production with considerable increase in overall water-cut. High degree of heterogeneity and adverse mobility ratio were the key factors contributing to the fast water-cut increase, which reduces the waterflooding recovery efficiency. Pilot simulations of EOR recovery techniques such as miscible CO2, WAG and chemical EOR processes indicated significant potential in recovery efficiency over waterflooding for the reservoir. This paper presents methodologies in designing laboratory experimental and reservoir modeling studies of EOR processes and pilot simulation design for the selected EOR process in SAMA. One of the challenges in developing the simulation model for SAMA was to capture heterogeneity of the reservoir which impacts the fluid flow. In this paper, we show the importance of generating fine-grid model and calibrating the model with the historical production, pressure data, production logging tool (PLT) data, repeat formation test (RFT) pressure profiles, and tracer breakthrough data, to tackle the issue of capturing those details related to fluid flow behavior in the reservoir. Data necessary for studying the surfactant-polymer (SP) chemical EOR process were collected and the suitable surfactant(s) and polymer were identified through an extensive laboratory program, which were critical in designing a chemical formulation suitable for this high temperature and high salinity carbonate reservoir. The single well chemical tracer (SWCT) tests1 performed at SAMA indicated substantial reduction in the residual oil saturation by the chosen chemical formulation. The results of the SAMA SWCT tests were incorporated in the pilot simulation model. A field pilot program was recommended through pilot-scale simulations. A regular 5-spot pattern on approximately 5 acres is recommended in waterflooded area. The objectives of the field pilot are to 1) Identify the EOR process efficiency in terms of residual oil saturation reduction and sweep, 2) test injectivity and handling of injection and produced fluids, and 3) collect data for analyzing EOR process efficiency and for model calibration.

                    "abstract": "Millimeter-sized (10 µm–mm) preformed particle gels (PPGs) have been used successfully as conformance-control agents in more than 5,000 wells. They help to control both water and CO2 production through high-permeability streaks or conduits (large pore openings), which naturally exist or are aggravated either by mineral solution or by a high injection pressure during the flooding process. This paper explores several factors that can have an important impact on the injectivity and plugging efficiency of PPGs in these conduits. Extensive experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the conduit inner diameter and the PPG strength on the ratio of the particle size to the opening diameter, injectivity index, resistance factor, and plugging efficiency. Five-foot tubes with four internal diameters were designed to emulate the opening conduits. Three pressure taps were mounted along the tubes to monitor PPG transport and plugging performance. The results show that weak gel has less injection pressure at a large particle/opening ratio compared to strong gel. PPG strength affected injectivity more significantly than did particle/opening ratio. Resistance factor increased as the brine concentration and conduit inner diameter increased. PPGs can significantly reduce the permeability of a conduit, and their plugging efficiency depends highly on the particle strength and the conduit inner diameter. The particle size of PPGs was reduced during their transport through conduits. Experimental results confirm that the size reduction was caused by both dehydration and breakdown. On the basis of the laboratory data, two correlations were developed to quantitatively calculate the resistance factor and the stable injection pressure as a function of the particle strength, particle/opening ratio, and shear rate. This research provides significant insight into designing better millimeter-sized particle-gel treatments intended for use in large openings, including open fractures, caves, worm holes, and conduits.

                    "abstract": "There are few low-salinity-water-injection (LSWI) models proposed for carbonate rocks, mainly because of incomplete understanding of complex chemical interactions of rock/oil/brine. This paper describes a new empirical method to model the LSWI effect on oil recovery from carbonate rocks, on the basis of the history matching and validation of recently published corefloods. In this model, the changes in the oil relative permeability curve and residual oil saturation as a result of the LSWI effect are considered. The water relative permeability parameters are assumed constant, which is a relatively fair assumption on the basis of history matching of coreflood data. The capillary pressure is neglected because we assumed several capillary pressure curves in our simulations in which it had a negligible effect on the history-match results. The proposed model is implemented in the UTCHEM simulator, which is a 3D multiphase flow, transport, and chemical-flooding simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin (UTCHEM 2000), to match and predict the multiple cycles of low-salinity experiments. The screening criteria for using the proposed LSWI model are addressed in the paper. The developed model gives more insight into the oil-production potential of future waterflood projects with a modified water composition for injection. "

A numerical simulator was developed to characterize the propagation of PPGs through given reservoir. The simulator was used to optimize the gel treatment design to enhance oil recovery from un-swept, low-permeability, and oil-rich zones. A novel core flooding experiment was conducted to validate the developed mechanistic models. The experimental results using heterogeneous permeability model without cross flow showed large incremental oil recovery from the low permeability sand pack after treatment with PPGs. The developed models were implemented into the gel transport reservoir simulator to aid in the design and to optimize the water control processes using PPGs. The results obtained from the simulator indicated a good match with core flooding experiment results.

A four-phase chemical flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM) was used to history match a recently published coreflooding experiment and simulate the field-scale reservoir. The results from the history matching and reservoir simulation revealed that interfacial tension (IFT) reduction between oil and water by the surfactant, displacement of oil by gas, and mobility control of gas are believed to be the main contributors to increase oil production. Based on these key findings, modeling of low-tension surfactant-gas flooding achieves a recovery of 91% of initial oil (Sio=0.56) in laboratory coreflood and a wide range of recovery factors between 65–88% of residual oil trapped by water in the numerical models in reservoir scale.

A four-phase flow and transport formulation is needed to accurately model these EOR methods. New experimental data are now available to help in the development and validation of such models. In particular, the effect of pressure and solution gas on microemulsion phase behavior is now much better understood because of new and much more systematic experimental data. New low-tension gas or alkali surfactant foam experiments have also recently been published. In this paper, we present a four-phase flow formulation implemented in the numerical reservoir simulator UTCHEM, a compositional model developed specifically to simulate both lab-scale and field-scale chemical EOR. UTCHEM includes a third-order TVD finite-difference method to improve numerical accuracy of the extremely non-linear chemical processes. A black-oil model for water/oil/gas is coupled with the surfactant/oil/water (microemulsion) phase behavior model through a new formulation. The new formulation includes water, oil, gas, surfactant, polymer and electrolyte components in the aqueous, oleic, microemulsion and gas phases. The PVT properties are calculated for each phase using this model. The impact of pressure and solution gas on the optimum salinity and interfacial tension will be discussed. The four-phase flow simulator has been used to model low-tension gas flooding taking into account process mechanisms. The results aid in the understanding and interpretation of four-phase flow chemical EOR processes. The simulator can be used to evaluate chemical EOR methods involving solution gas and/or free gas, to scale up lab experiments to the field and to optimize chemical EOR process design for field tests among other applications. The need for a reliable mechanistic simulator has greatly increased due to more field applications of chemical EOR with gas and the expected further increase of this type of EOR. "

A gas compositional model is coupled with microemulsion phase behavior to capture important mechanisms in hybrid gas-chemical flood processes in porous media. Two different surfactant molecules are simultaneously applied: one to lower interfacial tension to ultra-low values and one to keep foam stable as gas mobility control agent. This process cannot currently be modeled using the commercial reservoir simulators. We implemented the option for two surfactants into the existing gas compositional simulator with foam and hysteresis options. A predictive simulator would make it possible to select the best candidates for field application and tailor process design to particular characteristics of each field. In the field-scale application of the Surfactant Alternating Gas (SAG) process, multiphase fluid behavior in porous media is modeled using three-phase compositional relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models to include both compositional and saturation history effects. These models represent a more-accurate prediction of the cycle-dependent properties of SAG. The gas entrapment in the foam flow is used to predict the hysteresis effect within each cycle using a dynamic Land coefficient. The in-situ foaming behavior is estimated based on the mechanistic foam models. This study, further, evaluates mobilization and displacement of residual oil in tight reservoirs using the low-tension gas flood and compares the results with other EOR options. Using a reliable multiphase simulator low-tension gas experiments can be scaled up to the field and to optimize chemical-gas EOR process design. Numerical simulation of the SAG with and without hysteresis is used to assess the effect of the gas-entrapment on oil recovery and gas utilization factor in a field-scale application. "

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding is one of the most widely used chemical enhanced oil recovery methods due to its simplicity and low cost. To achieve high oil recoveries, large quantities of polymer solution is often injected through a small wellbore. Sometimes, the economic success of the project is only feasible when injection rate is high for high viscosity solution. However, injection of viscous polymer solutions has been a concern for the field application of polymer flooding. The pressure increase in polymer injectors can be attributed to (1) formation of an oil bank, (2) polymer rheology (shear-thickening behavior at near well-bore), and (3) plugging of the reservoir pores by insoluble polymer molecules or suspended particles in the water. In this paper, we propose a new model to history match field injection rate/pressure data. The pertinent equations for deep-bed filtration and external cake build-up in radial coordinate were coupled to the viscoelastic polymer rheology to capture important mechanisms. We selected radial coordinate in order to minimize the velocity/shear rate errors due to gridblock size in Cartesian coordinate. We used filtration theory and successfully history matched the field data. We performed systematic simulations and studied the impact of adsorption (retention), shear thickening, deep bed filtration, and external cake formation to explain the well injectivity behavior of polymer. The simulation results indicate that the gradual increase in bottomhole pressure during early times is attributed to the shear thickening rheology at high velocities experienced by viscoelastic HPAM polymers around the wellbore and the permeability reduction due to polymer adsorption and internal filtration of undissolved polymer. However, the linear impedance during external cake growth is responsible for the sharper increase in injection pressure at the later times. The proposed model can be used to calculate the injectivity of the polymer injection wells, understand the contribution of different phenomena on the pressure rise in the wells, locate the plugging or damage that may be caused by polymer, and accordingly design the chemical stimulation if necessary.

Hence, accurate modeling of single well chemical tracer field tests (SWCTTs) is essential. In this paper, modeling and simulation of SWCTT of low salinity water injection in a carbonate reservoir is investigated using the UTCHEM reservoir simulator.

This finding validates the approach used and the implementation of both tracer reactions and LSWI model in UTCHEM.

Modeling CO2 sequestration in underground aquifers requires the implementation of models of multiphase flow and CO2 and brine phase behavior. Capillary pressure and relative permeability need to be consistent with permeability/porosity variations of the rock. It is, therefore, crucial to gain confidence in the numerical models by validating the models and results by use of laboratory and field pilot results. A published CO2/brine laboratory coreflood was selected for our simulation study. The experimental results include subcore porosity and CO2-saturation distributions by means of a computed tomography (CT) scanner along with a CO2-saturation histogram. Data used in this paper are all based on those provided by Krause et al. (2011), with the exception of the CT porosity data. We generated a heterogeneous distribution for the porosity but honoring the mean value provided by Krause et al. (2011). We also generated the permeability distribution with the mean value for the whole core given by Krause et al. (2011). All the other data, such as the core dimensions, injection rate, outlet pressure, temperature, relative permeability, and capillary pressure, are the same as those in Krause et al. (2011). High-resolution coreflood simulations of brine displacement with supercritical CO2 are presented with the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Wheeler and Wheeler 1990). A 3D synthetic core model was constructed with permeability and porosity distributions generated by use of the geostatistical software FFTSIM (Jennings et al. 2000), with cell sizes of 1.27 x 1.27 x 6.35 mm. The core was initially saturated with brine. Fluid properties were calibrated with the equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model to match the measured data provided by Krause et al. (2011). We used their measured capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. However, we scaled capillary pressure on the basis of the Leverett J-function (Leverett 1941) for permeability, porosity, and interfacial tension (IFT) in every simulation grid cell. Saturation images provide insight into the role of heterogeneity of CO2 distribution in which a slight variation in porosity gives rise to large variations in CO2-saturation distribution in the core. High-resolution numerical results indicated that accurate representation of capillary pressure at small scales was critical. Residual brine saturation and the subsequent shift in the relative permeability curves showed a significant impact on final CO2 distribution in the core. "

                    "abstract": "The need for improved models to simulate chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) methods involving either free gas or solution gas has increased in recent years as it has become more common to inject surfactants to recover live oils using surfactant-polymer or alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding, or to inject gas with the surfactant solution (low-tension gas flooding or foam). A four-phase flow and transport formulation is needed to accurately model these EOR methods. New experimental data are now available to help in the development and validation of such models. In particular, the effect of pressure and solution gas on microemulsion phase behavior is now much better understood because of new and much more systematic experimental data. New low-tension gas or alkali surfactant foam experiments have also recently been published. In this paper, we present a four-phase flow formulation implemented in the numerical reservoir simulator UTCHEM, a compositional model developed specifically to simulate both lab-scale and field-scale chemical EOR. UTCHEM includes a third-order TVD finite-difference method to improve numerical accuracy of the extremely non-linear chemical processes. A black-oil model for oil/water/gas is coupled with the surfactant/oil/water (microemulsion) phase behavior model through a new formulation. The new formulation includes water, oil, gas, surfactant, polymer and electrolyte components in the aqueous, oleic, microemulsion and gas phases. The PVT properties are calculated for each phase using this model. The impact of pressure and solution gas on the optimum salinity and interfacial tension will be discussed. The four-phase flow simulator has been used to model low tension gas flooding taking into account process mechanisms. The results aid in the understanding and interpretation of four-phase flow chemical EOR processes. The simulator can be used to evaluate chemical EOR methods involving solution gas and/or free gas, to scale up lab experiments to the field and to optimize chemical EOR process design for field tests among other applications. The need for a reliable mechanistic simulator has greatly increased due to more field applications of chemical EOR with gas and the expected further increase of this type of EOR. "

                    "abstract": "CO2 flood and polymer flood are two proven and commercially practiced technologies for several decades. Traditional gas flood methods suffer from inadequate sweep efficiency and incomplete recovery of oil. Several methods to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency are practiced in field operations such as water alternating gas (WAG), polymer-gel, and foam-WAG. Polymer is traditionally added to the water flood projects to reduce the mobility of water in an effort to improve the water sweep efficiency and increase oil production especially from heterogeneous reservoirs. Both polymer and gas floods are mature technologies for improved oil recovery. However, few studies have been done on combined application of the two methods. In this paper, we conducted simulation study of the potential benefit of adding polymer to the water in the CO2 WAG process, taking the advantage of CO2 miscibility with oil and polymer conformance control during water cycle. A commercial reservoir simulator CMG-STARS is used in this study, with its PVT module CMG-WinProp. A comprehensive polymer property module is used to calculate the shear thinning rheology and non-linear mixing of polymer solution in addition to the polymer adsorption and mobility reduction factor. Field scale simulations are performed based on a real field geological model and light oil fluid properties, taking into account the heterogeneity and EOR design. The performance of each EOR method on oil recovery is also evaluated, including the water flood, CO2 flood, water alternating gas (WAG), and polymer alternating gas (PAG). Based on this pilot study, polymer alternating gas flood has the highest oil recovery factor of 74%, while WAG has 68% and water flood has 59% oil recovery factor. This field scale simulation study demonstrated positive response of PAG compared to WAG, water, or CO2 floods in oil recovery and total injection. "

This model represents a new method to couple black oil model with chemical phase behavior i.e. Hand's rule. Hand's rule is used to capture the equilibrium among surfactant, oil, and water species as a function of salinity and species concentrations for oil/water/microemulsion phases. Therefore, inter-phase mass transfer between gas/oil or steam/water in the presence of the microemulsion phase and the equilibrium between phases is calculated. Furthermore, a new volume balance equation is derived to develop pressure equation for compressible and real mixtures. Hence, the pressure equation is derived by extending the black oil model to a pseudo-compositional model for a wide range of components (water, oil, surfactant, polymer, anion, cation, alcohol, and gas). Mass balance equations are then solved for each component to calculate the volumetric concentration. Finally, we implemented the coupled surfactant and black oil phase behavior models and the fluid flow formulations in an IMPEC chemical flooding simulator (UTCHEM). The results are validated against conventional reservoir simulators for several three-phase cases comprising steam/water/oil, gas/oil/water, and oil/water/microemulsion. The results show that the new phase behavior model and the fluid flow formulations are reliable and in good agreement with other reservoir simulators for all case studies. Moreover, the findings of this study can be used to model and capture all possible four-phase flow that may arise in hybrid thermal-chemical flooding applications and considering different phenomena such as inter-phase mass transfer.

                    "abstract": "The interest in modeling geochemical reactions has increased significantly for different improved oil recovery processes such as Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flood, low salinity water flood, and EDTA injection as a sacrificial agent in hard brine. Numerical simulation of multiphase flow coupled with geochemical reactions is challenging due to complex and coupled aqueous, aqueous-solid, and aqueous-oleic reactions. These reactions have significant impact upon oil recovery, and hence a robust geochemical simulator is important. UTCHEM is a chemical flooding reservoir simulator with geochemical modeling capability. Nevertheless, one major limitation in the geochemical reactive engine of UTCHEM is assuming the activities of reactive species are equal to unity. In fact, the activity coefficients are strongly non-linear functions of the ionic strength of solution. One approach to tackle this deficiency was to couple UTCHEM (flow and transport) with IPhreeqc (a geochemical reactive engine). However, the simulator proved to be computationally expensive. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the geochemical reactive engine within UTCHEM. This paper presents the improvement of the geochemical reactive engine in UTCHEM including implementing different activity coefficient models for different reactive species, cation exchange reactions, and numerical convergence. Certain unknown concentrations are eliminated from the elemental mass balance equations and the reaction equations to reduce the computational burden. The Jacobian matrix and RHS are updated accordingly in the Newton-Raphson method for performing the batch reaction calculation. A low salinity water flood case is presented to validate the updated UTCHEM against PHREEQC and UTCHEM-IPhreeqc. The simulation studies indicated that the updated geochemical simulator succeeds in tackling the inaccuracy concerned in the original UTCHEM. Also, the updated version is more efficient compared to PHREEQC and UTCHEM-IPhreeqc with the same degree of accuracy. The updated geochemical simulator is then applied to model an ASP coreflood, in which EDTA is used as a scarifying agent to chelate calcium and magnesium ions. The experimental data of pH, oil recovery, and pressure drop were successfully history matched with predictions of the effluent concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. A synthetic 3D ASP pilot case is successfully simulated considering effects of acid equilibrium constant on oil recovery. "

There is a need for improved three-phase relative permeability models with hysteresis, especially including the effects of cycle dependency so that more-accurate predictions of these methods can be made. We propose new three-phase relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models applicable to different fluid configurations in a porous medium under different wettability conditions. The relative permeability model includes both the saturation history and compositional effects. Three-phase parameters are estimated on the basis of saturation-weighted interpolation of two-phase parameters. The hysteresis model is an extension of the Land trapping model (Land 1968) but with a dynamic Land coefficient introduced. The trapping model estimates a constantly increasing trapped saturation for intermediate-wetting and nonwetting phases. The hysteresis model overcomes some of the limitations of existing three-phase hysteresis models for nonwater-wet rocks and mitigates the complexity associated with commonly applied models in numerical simulators. The relative permeability model is validated by use of multicycle three-phase water-alternating-gas experimental data for nonwater-wet rocks. Numerical simulations of a carbonate reservoir with and without hysteresis were used to assess the effect of the saturation direction and saturation path on gas entrapment and oil recovery. "

Chemical processes such as surfactant/alkali-induced wettability alteration and interfacial tension (IFT) reduction have shown great potential to reduce the residual oil saturation in matrix blocks, leading to significant incremental oil recovery (IOR). However, the time required to achieve a significant amount of oil recovery is the most crucial deciding factor in field projects. The magnitude of recovery and response time of any chemical process depends on the degree of wettability alteration and IFT reduction, the nature and density of fracture network, and the matrix block size. Oil recovery experiments were performed for the same matrix rock and chemical formulation, but for different sized cores to gain a better understanding of the time dependence of the recovery process. The measured oil recoveries were history-matched. The simulation models were then used to predict the recovery response times for larger cores. The controlled and systematic laboratory measurements for several core sizes helped in developing dimensionless scaling groups to aid in understanding the time dependence and the upscaling of laboratory results to field-scale applications. This finding is significant as it illustrates the extent of wettability alteration and IFT reduction needed in fractured reservoirs. Laboratory measurements and simulation work substantiate the validity and the range of applicability of upscaled procedures and indicate the importance of viscous and buoyancy forces in larger field cases. The results of this work will be useful for the design of future field projects. "

Minimizing risk and uncertainty is a major part of any proposed improved oil recovery method by highlighting the most significant design parameters and optimizing the entire process.  This paper investigates the optimization of the LSWI process at field scale for carbonate reservoirs by considering the most influential design parameters. Seven uncertain and decision design parameters were selected. 5-spot LSWI pilot models were simulated using UTCHEM reservoir simulator with an empirical LSWI model. The Design of Experiment (DoE) method was used for sensitivity analysis and screening out insignificant parameters. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was implemented to optimize the LSWI cumulative oil recovery where a response surface was built. The performed sensitivity analysis showed that the three most important design parameters are LSWI slug size, reservoir heterogeneity (VDP), and injected water salinity. An optimum LSWI design was suggested and the results were validated using the UTCHEM simulator. Moreover, two scenarios (best and worst) were created to highlight the individual and combined effects of the seven tested design parameters on cumulative oil recovery by LSWI. By understanding the most influential LSWI design parameters, the field scale development can be conducted with more certainty and lower risk. Introduction The low salinity water injection (LSWI) is gaining popularity as an improved oil recovery technique because of its simplicity compared to other techniques. The LSWI effect on oil recovery has been shown at laboratory scale and to a limited extent at field scale for both carbonate and sandstone rocks. For full field scale development, optimizing the LSWI process by minimizing the related risk and uncertainty, and identifying the most significant design parameters is still a concern, which is addressed in this paper. Reviews of LSWI effect on oil recovery at field scale, Design of Experiment (DoE), Response Surface Methodology (RSM), and optimization are presented. The field scale studies started in sandstone rocks to investigate the effect of LSWI on oil recovery. The first field pilot was reported by Webb et al. (2004) as a single well chemical tracer test (SWCTT) and then McGuire et al. (2005) in sandstone reservoirs. Both tests showed a positive response by reducing the remaining oil saturation in both secondary and tertiary modes. The reported remaining oil saturation for these studies ranged from 30 to 50%, which is in match with the conducted laboratory studies. Seccombe et al. (2008) investigated the benefits of tertiary LSWI at the Endicott Field located in the North Slope of Alaska. They observed a constant water relative permeability at residual oil saturation for both low and high salinity water injections, which was consistent with their corefloods, numerical matching of the data, and the constant productivity of the wells from the SWCTTs. Later in the same field, the first comprehensive inter-well application was reported by Seccombe et al. (2010) involving an injector and a producer 1040 feet apart. The results were in agreement with the corefloods and SWCTTs as 10% incremental oil was recovered after the injection of 1.6 pore volumes of LSWI. "

Naturally fractured reservoirs are challenging targets for chemical flooding because they typically have a high permeability contrast between the fractures and the matrix with a low matrix permeability. Some of the world׳s largest oil reservoirs are fractured carbonates with a high reservoir temperature and a high salinity formation brine. Some of them also have low API gravity oils, which also increases the difficulty of recovering the oil. A surfactant formulation has been developed that shows promising results for such difficult reservoirs. Ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) and good aqueous stability were achieved with this new carboxylate surfactant in a hard brine at a high reservoir temperature of 100 °C. Both static and dynamic imbibition experiments were conducted using a fractured carbonate core. 65.9% Oil recovery was obtained in fractured coreflood compared to 33.3% oil recovery in static imbibition test. The surfactant retention was low at 0.086 mg/g of rock. The oil recovery is excellent taking into account that the temperature and salinity conditions were harsh, the core was extremely vuggy and fractured, no mobility control was used, and only a small surfactant slug was injected. The coreflood results were interpreted using a mechanistic chemical reservoir simulator. It showed that both the mechanisms of IFT reduction and wettability alteration were important for oil recovery. Neither IFT reduction nor wettability alteration alone recovered oil as high as the combined contributions from both. "

                    "abstract": "The primary objective of particle gel treatment is to significantly reduce water flow through high-permeability channels without damaging oil production zones. The ability of gels to reduce permeability to water much more than permeability to oil is a critical aspect of the success of water control in both production wells and in-depth fluid diversion conformance control. This work investigates factors affecting particle gel placement through fractures and determines the extent to which particle gels can reduce water permeability more than oil permeability within a fracture. Experimental models were designed to study the effect of the particle gel size, particle gel strength, fracture width, and oil viscosity on the disproportionate permeability reduction (DPR). Five-foot tubes with two internal diameters were used to represent a fracture with two different widths. PPGs were injected first into the fractures, followed by alternating floods of water and oil. During the gel injection, the resistance factors (Fr) increased as the gel particle size, gel strength, and fracture width increased. Results obtained from the alternating floods show that the DPR increased as the oil viscosity, particle size, gel strength, and fracture width increased. Gel shrinkage, gel strength, and gel dehydration were found to contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The permeability reduction factor to water increased, becoming 100 to 1700 times greater than the permeability reduction factor to oil. The injection pressure for different water cycles increased as more cycles were performed. These increases, however, were not significant when observed for different oil cycles. The experimental results show that when a second water cycle was injected to displace oil, the residual resistance factor for water (Frrw) in the second cycle was significantly less than the preceding Frrw values. This finding indicates that the gel experienced a significant breakdown during the first oil cycles. Additional oil cycles were performed, and the Frrw decreased during each new brine cycle, indicating further gel breakdown. Introduction Controlling water production to improve oil recovery in mature oil fields has become a primary task for oil companies. Decreasing water production not only increases oil recovery efficiently, but also extends the life of reservoirs. A decrease in water production also decreases the environmental pollution associated with water production. High-permeability streaks, caves, wormholes, fractures, and channels inside reservoirs are the main sources of severe fluid-channeling problems, particularly in mature oil reservoirs. Water flows easily through these features, leaving large amounts of unrecovered oil in unswept areas. Many methods and materials have been proposed not only to reduce water production, but also to improve oil recovery. Chemical methods are becoming more prevalent, especially when the primary cause of water production is a result of heterogeneities in reservoirs. Gel treatments are commonly applied to improve conformance and control water and gas channeling through reservoirs. Several different types of commercial gels are frequently used to control water production, including polymers with a cross linker, preformed bulk gels, partially preformed gels, colloidal dispersion gels (CDGs),  preformed particle gels (PPGs), temperature–triggered microgels (known as Bright Water), pH-sensitive microgels, and non-toxic soft size–controlled microgels (known as STARPOL). The main differences between these gels are their size, swelling ratio, and swelling time. "

Their permeability reduction capabilities, when triggered, enable the strategic plugging of high-permeability channels so as to divert flooding fluid to the relatively unswept adjacent low-permeability zones. This improves macroscopic sweep efficiency, increasing hydrocarbon production and decreasing associated water production. Polymer microgel flooding thus serves to provide in-depth conformance control, distinguishing it from conventional polymer floods that offer primarily mobility control benefits. This paper provides a literature review on the use of polymer microgel technology for conformance control purposes. Polymer microgel flooding is first introduced, and the motivation for their use over conventional polymer flooding is outlined. This is followed by a discussion on the characterization of polymer microgels as well as some theories on how they act as conformance control agents. In addition, an extensive survey of four different types of polymer microgels (Colloidal Dispersion Gels, Preformed Particle Gels, Temperature-Sensitive Microgels, and pH-Sensitive Polymer Microgels) is provided. Attention is mainly given to the microgel characteristics, laboratory observations, and field applications. The rheology and plugging mechanism of the different polymer microgels are also discussed in some detail. Polymer microgel flooding is gaining popularity as a means of conformance control. Despite uncertainty around the precise mechanism by which microgels divert flow, numerous lab and field applications have demonstrated this technology׳s ability to improve sweep efficiency and enhance oil recovery.

                    "abstract": "In the electrical joule′s heating process, the reservoirs are heated in situ by electrical energy to reduce the viscosity. In principle, electrical current passes through the reservoir fluids due mostly to the electrical conductivity of saturated fluids such as saline water. The flow of electrical current through the reservoir leads the heat in the reservoir and thereby drastically reduces the oil viscosity. In this process, electrical current can flow between electrical potential sources (wells) and generate the joule′s heat. Therefore, the regions around the electrodes in (or around) the wells are extremely heated. Because the wells act as line sources for the electrical potential, greater heating takes place near the wellbore causing possible vaporization of water in that region. Since steam has very low electrical conductivity, it can reduce the efficiency of this process significantly. In this process electrical conductivity plays a very important role. In order to increase efficiency of this type of heating process, the presence of optimum saline water saturation is an essential design factor. In order to simulate a challenging multiphysics problem, we use three Maxwell classical electromagnetism equations. These equations are simplified and assumed for low frequency to obtain the conservation of electrical current equation and Ohm's law. The conservation of electrical current and Ohm's law are implemented using a finite difference method in a four phase chemical flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM). The joule′s heating rate due to electrical current is calculated and added as an energy source to the energy balance equation. A typical reservoir model is built and constant electrical potential with alternating current (AC) is applied to this model to study the efficiency of the electrical joule′s heating process in the presence of water saturated fracture and evaluate this efficiency at, above, and/or below the water boiling point. Results illustrate that water saturation in the presence of fracture and electrical conductivity of saturated rock have an important effect on the joule′s heating process. In this paper, we show that since, steam is a non-conductive electrical phase, this process should be designed to keep the temperature below the boiling point by circulating water. This can prevent the evaporation leading to an increase in the process efficiency. Electrical conductivity of water can also be easily increased by injecting high salinity water into the reservoir and increasing the amount of heat substantially. This is highly beneficial and the main advantage of the electrical joule′s heating process that can obtain high recovery in comparison to other thermal recovery methods. In this paper the understanding of the influence of saline water and steam forming is a key finding in order to economically optimize the process to unlock heavy oil reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Steam foam is a hybrid and novel method of the thermal and chemical flooding to improve the sweep efficiency of steam for producing heavy crude oils. Steam injection is a mature process to substantially reduce the oil viscosity in heavy oil reservoirs to increase its mobility. Steam flooding is an unstable displacement since the gravity of steam causes poor vertical sweep efficiency due to the gravity override in thick high permeability pay zones and poor areal sweep efficiency in high permeability channels with high connectivity. On the other hand foam reduces the mobility of steam by stabilizing the liquid lamellae that cause some or all of the steam to exist as a discontinuous phase. Therefore, foam plugs large pores to divert the flow into the low permeability zones and controls gravity override. Foam increases the pressure gradient slightly in the steam swept regions and leads to heating oil more efficiently when steam diverts into the cold unswept regions. Furthermore, surfactant mobilizes the high viscous oil by emulsification and reduction of interfacial tension. The synergy of steam, surfactant, and foam has the potential to greatly improve the recovery of heavy oil reservoirs. Based on a literature survey, steam foam injection has been conducted in both laboratory corefloods and few field pilots. On the other hand, existing numerical simulators have not been able to capture the mechanisms involved in such a process. In this paper, we present the development and implementation of a new robust steam formulation in a four phase chemical flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM) to model and understand the contribution of each mechanism such as viscosity reduction, emulsification, and foam for mobility control. Results illustrate that the steam foam process controls the mobility of steam to avoid incomplete vertical sweep due to gravity segregation. Formation of the emulsion phase by condensing steam along with the presence of water leads to an increase in the emulsion viscosity and thereby decreases water production. The presence of surfactant and emulsification of oil either as water in oil or oil in water emulsions can also impact the displacement and propagation of viscous oil. The mechanistic understanding of steam foam process and improvement of the heat transfer compared to conventional steam flooding is a key finding in this research to optimize the technology that unlocks heavy oil reservoirs with favorable economics.

                    "abstract": "In applications of polymer flood for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), polymer injectivity is of great concern because project economics is sensitive to injection rates. In-situ non-Newtonian polymer rheology is the most crucial factor that affects polymer injectivity. There are several ongoing polymer-injection field tests in which the field injectivities differ significantly from the simulation forecasts. We have developed an analytical model to more accurately calculate and predict polymer injectivity during the field projects to help with optimum injection strategies. Significant viscosity variations during polymer flood occur in the vicinities of wellbores where velocities are high. As the size of a wellblock increases, velocity smears, and thus polymer injectivity is erroneously calculated. In the University of Texas Chemical Flooding Simulator (UTCHEM), the solution was to use an effective radius to capture the \"grid effect,\" which is empirical and impractical for large-scale field simulations with several hundred wells. Another approach is to use local grid refinement near wells, but this adds to the computational cost and limits the size of the problem. An attractive alternative to previous approaches is to extend the Peaceman well model Peaceman 1983) to non-Newtonian polymer solutions. The polymer rheological model and its implementation in UTCHEM were validated by simulating single-phase polymer injectivity in coreflood experiments. On the basis of the Peaceman well model and UTCHEM polymer rheological models covering both shear-thinning and shear-thickening polymers, an analytical polymer injectivity model was developed. The analytical model was validated by comparing results of different gridblock sizes and radial numerical simulation. We also tested a field case by comparing results of a fine-grid simulation and its up-scaled coarse-grid model. A pilot-scale polymer flood was simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed analytical model. The model successfully captured polymer injectivity in all of these cases with no need to introduce empirical parameters. "

Excess water production through fractures and high permeability thief zones is a major concern for sweep efficiency and oil production. Gel treatment has been applied widely to plug thief zones and reduce excess water production to improve sweep efficiency. Field studies demonstrated that gel treatments can be applied successfully in mature and fractured reservoirs to reduce unwanted fluid production to lower the operating cost than can cause premature well abandonment. The primary objective of this work is to identify where particle gels can be most effective. These gels swell quickly to become large soft gel particles when added into water. It can be injected as a suspension in water into an injection well. Many experiments were performed to understand the transport mechanism of microgel through porous media and to identify the control variables. The lab data include oil recovery, water cut, resistance factor, residual resistance factor, oil viscosities, gel concentrations, salinity, gel rheology, and gel strength. The success of gel treatment depends on the magnitude of permeability reduction and flow diversion. We have also developed correlations for permeability reduction factor and apparent viscosity as a function of gel strength, gel concentration, rock permeability, salinity, and flow rate. The models are validated against lab measurements and implemented into a reservoir simulator called UTGEL. Gel properties such as swelling ratio, rheology and adsorption are also investigated. The mechanistic models developed help to pick conformance control candidates for a given field and to optimize the gel chemistry and treatment. "

However, previous studies have focused on the evaluation of stiff particles, such as silica and aluminum oxide. In this paper, we present our experimental results of deformable nanoparticle transport behavior through porous media. Nanogel particles with sizes ranging from 100-285 nm were used to represent deformable nanoparticles. Core flooding tests were run using sandstone cores with water permeabilities ranging from 42 to 1,038 mD. We investigated the effects of the permeability, particle concentration, particle deformability, and flow rate on the particle propagation, resistance factor, and residual resistance factor (permeability reduction factor). The results show that the resistance factor ranged from 5 to 14 for rocks with permeabilities higher than 311 mD, indicating that the nanoparticles were able to transport easily through these rocks. However, the resistance increased to 383 when the permeability was as low as 41.2 mD, indicating that the nanogel could not penetrate the rock easily. After placing the particles, brine was injected at different flow rates. The results indicate that the nanoparticles effectively reduced the permeability of the rocks with the original permeabilities of 143 to 555.4 mD, but the residual resistance factor of the high-permeability rock (1,038 mD) was relatively small, ranging from 2.67 to 4.39. The resistance factor and residual resistance factor increased with the particle concentration and decreased with the flow rate, and both factors can be well fitted using power law equations as a function of velocity. The nanogel adsorption layer thickness decreased with the shear rate. "

                    "abstract": "In recent years, polymer flood of heavy oil has been extensively studied in laboratories and successfully applied in several fields. This paper reports the laboratory corefloods, development of mechanistic models, and simulation studies of polymer flood in a heavy oil reservoir with active aquifer influxes. Bentley Field, owned by Xcite Energy Resources, is located on the UK Continental Shelf. Flow tests confirmed the existence of a large, active bottom aquifer which causes polymer loss and decreases the economic attractiveness of polymer flood. To analyze the impact of the aquifer on oil recovery efficiency, a reservoir simulation model was set up. Several development scenarios have been simulated for the optimization of development strategy. Another critical challenge is that the oil viscosity (>1000 cp) exceeds the economic and technical limit of oil viscosity (150 cp) for polymer flood according to the commonly accepted EOR screening criteria. To validate the applicability of polymer flood, two laboratory experiments were conducted with two different sandpacks. Waterflood ceased when water cut reached 90% and only less than 25% of oil in place was recovered. However, the remaining oil saturations after both tertiary polymer corefloods were only about 5%. We investigated the recovery mechanisms and developed a mechanistic model to match the laboratory observations. Simulation results show that for this heavy oil field with an active aquifer, polymer flood economics can be improved by optimizing well locations, number of horizontal wells, polymer concentrations, polymer injection time, etc. In history matching coreflood experiments, two oil saturation reduction mechanisms were considered: (1) viscous polymer solution reduces viscous fingering and channeling effects especially in heavy oil and also reduces remaining oil saturation after waterflood; (2) remaining oil can be mobilized by viscoelastic properties of synthetic polymer solutions. Both mechanisms were considered in the simulation study where favorable match of oil recovery and pressure drop was obtained. In this work, we proved polymer flood as a viable technology in a heavy oil reservoir despite the highly unfavorable mobility ratio and strong aquifer influxes. Considering the diminishing conventional oil reserves, polymer flood provides a non-thermal approach for producing heavy oil reserves. "

Nevertheless, the comprehensive modeling and prediction of such phenomena remains a challenge, due to the complexity of the precipitation kinetics and chemical reaction processes that occur in the reservoir. Hence, it is the case that often reactions in the reservoir are not considered on evaluation of the scaling tendency, probably because they are difficult to measure and also, to model the calculations considerable effort and expertise is required. Since no comprehensive geochemical-based modeling has been applied in this research area, in this work, a previously developed robust, accurate, and flexible integrated tool, UTCHEM-IPhreeqc, is used to model the comprehensive geochemistry to predict scales problem for field scale applications. IPhreeqc, the United States Geological Survey geochemical tool, is able to simulate both homogeneous and heterogeneous (mineral dissolution/precipitation), irreversible, and ion-exchange reactions under non-isothermal, non-isobaric and both local-equilibrium and kinetic conditions. Through coupling of IPhreeqc with UTCHEM, The University of Texas at Austin research chemical flooding reservoir simulator, the entire geochemical capabilities of IPhreeqc can be used in a multi-dimensional and multiphase reservoir simulator for comprehensive reactive-transport modelings. In this paper, the importance of ion activities, temperature, and pressure in the reactive-transport modeling is emphasized by performing several sensitivity analyses. Oilfield scale is quantified by including the effect of dissolution or precipitation of all possible minerals (either initially present or subsequently precipitated by injecting an incompatible water) on the reservoir petrophysical properties (e.g., porosity). Three common permeability–porosity approaches (Modified Fair–Hatch, Kozeny-Carman, and Verma-Pruess models) are then implemented in the UTCHEM-IPhreeqc simulation tool to model the effect of scalings on the reservoir permeability. To show how well this integrated tool can be applied for field scale applications, a synthetic five-spot pattern is presented using several water compositions. "

Prediction of oil recovery from SP flooding, however, is complex and time consuming. Thus, a quick and easy method is needed to screen reservoirs for potential SP floods. This paper presents a scaling model that is capable of producing reasonable estimates of oil recovery for a SP flood using a simple spreadsheet calculation. The model is also useful for initial SP design. We present key dimensionless groups that control recovery for a SP flood. The proper physics for SP floods including the optimal salinity in the three-phase region and the trapping number for residual oil saturation determination has been incorporated. Based on these groups, a Box–Behnken experimental design is performed to generate response surface fits for oil recovery prediction at key dimensionless times. The response surfaces derived can be used to estimate the oil recovery potential for any given reservoir and are ideal for screening large databases of reservoirs to identify the most attractive chemical flooding candidates. The response function can also be used for proper design of key parameters for SP flooding. Our model will aid engineers to understand how key parameters affect oil recovery without performing time consuming chemical simulations. This is the first time that dimensionless groups for SP flooding have been derived comprehensively to obtain a response function of oil recovery as a function of dimensionless groups. "

Most reservoirs in the US under operation by small producers have become mature due to extended waterflooding. In fact, an estimated 80% of the total number of oil wells in the US are now classified as “marginal.” The mature reservoirs accessed by these wells usually have a high water cut, in the range of 80% to 90%. Also, the industry typically leaves about 65% of oil behind after many years of waterflooding because of reservoir heterogeneity and incomplete sweep of the formation. Excessive water production becomes a major problem as these oil fields mature. High volumes of water production result in increased levels of corrosion and scale, increased load on fluid-handling facilities, increased environmental concerns, and eventually well abandonment (with associated workover costs). Consequently, producing zones are often abandoned in an attempt to avoid water contact, even when the intervals still retain large volumes of recoverable hydrocarbons. Controlling water production has been a challenging goal for most oil producers. "

Numerical results were consistent with bottom-hole injection flowing pressure for the first 350 days prior to the rate increase and also observed-CO2 breakthrough time at the first observation well. Results also illustrate the importance of using accurate trapping models to predict CO2 immobilization behavior.

                    "abstract": "Chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method includes the injection of a mixture of chemicals to improve sweep efficiency and produce residual oil saturation left behind in the swept volume after waterfloods.  The way chemical flood works is by the synergistic effect of polymer to improve mobility (slow down the movement of water to match that of the oil, i.e., mobility ratio of 1) and surfactant (with or without alkaline) to reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water to displace the discontinuous trapped oil remained in reservoir after the waterflood.  Surfactant flooding uses the same concept as using detergent/soap to remove oil. The primary objective of surfactant/polymer (SP) or alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) flooding is to reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water to values on the order of 0.001 dyne/cm or less in order to displace the trapped oil from rock pores. We present a novel method to predict the results of the chemical EOR processes using an analytical and robust forecasting model.  This fast and simple analytical approach will aid to screen chemical EOR projects where numerical simulations are not feasible due to either lack of data or the time and expertise required conducting such studies. The proposed forecasting model is based on a general approach for predicting the performance of isothermal EOR processes. The model incorporates fundamental principles of material balance, segregated flow and fractional flux while with effects of mobility ratio, chemical slug size, miscibility and reservoir heterogeneity. The permeability heterogeneity is modeled using Koval fractional flux model with its applicability to wide range of permeability and degree of heterogeneity. The forecasting tool has been successfully validated against numerous SP/ASP field and numerical simulation results. We also developed correlations to describe the model variables as functions of mobility ratio, slug size and reservoir heterogeneity based on the experimental design methodology and numerical simulation. Successful history matching against numerical simulation results and the strength of the developed correlations proved the ability of the model to predict SP/ASP results when field results are not available. The forecasting tool provides key results to assess the flood performance.  These include average oil saturation, cumulative oil recovery, oil cut, oil production rate, recovery efficiency and volumetric sweep efficiency as functions of time. An estimate of volumetric sweep efficiency helps in a better design and increases the chance of successful field projects. "

                    "abstract": "Waterflooding as a secondary oil recovery method is still the most commonly used technique for fluid injection since 1865. Recently researchers have discovered that the injected water quality is important and it should be monitored in addition to volume of water injected. This technique is known as low salinity water injection, LoSal®1, Smart Waterflood and Advanced Ion Management. Evidence from laboratory studies, supported by several field tests, has distinctly shown that injecting low salinity water can have a significant impact on oil recovery. Although there are many LoSal® experimental results reported in the literature, publications on modeling this process are scarce. In this paper, we propose a mechanistic modeling approach for the low salinity water injection. We believe no matter the manner and details of mechanism, it ought to be all about ions. The key objective in this approach is to link the water-rock chemistry to changes in the state of a rock (e.g., wettability). Since geochemical reactions are the basis for this mechanistic modeling, we would need a geochemical engine to handle geochemical reactions in the reservoir for properly modeling LoSal®. Toward this goal, it was decided to couple IPhreeqc, an open source geochemical module available by United States Geological Survey (USGS), with UTCHEM, an in-house research chemical flooding reservoir simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin. An algorithm is presented for modeling the geochemistry in an IMPEC (implicit in pressure and explicit in concentration) solution algorithm. Finally, we show how apply the integrated tool, UTCHEM-IPhreeqc, to model low salinity water injection. Geochemical-based models can easily be implemented in this modeling approach and also compared against experimental results for validation. Implementation of several mechanisms can finally reveal the dominant mechanism for the low salinity water injection. Introduction Waterflooding as a secondary oil recovery technique is still the most common and versatile method. This is on account of various reasons, ranging from high efficiency in displacing light to medium gravity crude oils, ease of injection into oilbearing formations, availability and low cost water to lower the project capital and operating costs. This obviously leads to favorable economics compared to other improved oil recovery (IOR) methods. However, in recent years a tertiary effect of waterflooding has been observed, depending on the composition and the salinity of the injected water. Literature shows that the adjustment of injected brine composition of a mature waterflood can cause an increase in oil production. This means that the quality of injected water is as important as the quantity and the former should be monitored. 1 LoSal® is a trade mark of BP p.l.c "

Vugs are 3D–printed in plastic and used to make a mold in Play-Doh®; which is cast in gypsum cement and used as a placeholder during the sintering process. The gypsum vug dissolves during acid flood, leaving an empty space inside the glass matrix. Computed tomography (CT) scans are made of the acid washed vug space and compared to the 3D model. "

These methods require assumptions that can lead to erroneous relative permeability data. One alternative approach is a gravity drainage method, which has previously been used in sandpacks and recently extended to cores at atmospheric conditions. Here, we test a gravity drainage method that can be used to measure relative permeability in cores at elevated pressures. To achieve this, nitrogen gas is injected to the core at a low flow rate to overcome capillary pressure. We test the method by measuring two-phase water relative permeability in a Berea sandstone core using two gas flow rates: one that is low enough that gravity is a significant driving force for the flow, and a higher flow rate for comparison. During drainage, water saturation is measured along the length of the core at different times using a CT scanner, and pressure drops are measured across five sections of the core. The relative permeability of water is calculated using data points in regions of the core where the saturation is changing in time but not space, allowing capillary end effects and capillary pressure gradients to be ignored. Relative permeability data from the low flow rate experiment are scattered widely; the low gas flow rate likely hindered the free drainage of the water. Relative permeability data from the higher flow rate experiment formed a distinct curve. More flow rates will need to be tested to determine an optimum flow rate for gravity drainage experiments at reservoir pressures. "

In this paper, we combine water alternating gas and nanoparticles to look into whether the presence of nanoparticles results in more CO2 being trapped, after an additional flood with brine. This paper concludes two experiments to study the transport behavior of nanoparticles. In the first experiment, CO2 was used to displace 2 wt% NaBr solution in a cylindrical core (diameter 7 cm, length 30 cm) of Boise sandstone (porosity 27.5%, permeability 1D), and then post flush with NaBr solution. For the second experiment, CO2 was used to displace the 2 wt% NaBr and 5 wt% nanoparticles solution in the core, and then post flush with nanoparticles solution. Dynamics of the displacement front and pressure drop across the core were measured in real time with CT scanner and pressure transducers respectively. Different front dynamics are seen of wetting and nonwetting phases and the stabilizing front is generated by Roof snap-off events. When CO2 displaces brine in which surface treated silica nanoparticles, the initial and residual CO2 saturation are higher than that of the brine without nanoparticles. And the C constant of Land-curve is 2.2 and 2.4 respectively in the nanoparticle case and control case. The results suggest that pre-positioning a dispersion of nanoparticles in the brine will be potential for mobility control in CO2 storage and CO2 EOR, and can eventually be used in engineering CO2 injection protocols. Introducing engineered nanoparticles into an aquifer or reservoir can potentially control the fluid mobility in CO2 storage and CO2 EOR. This provides an interesting alternative approach for mobility control in CO2 EOR which would work well with WAG processes. Moreover, the same process can increase enhance the residual trapping of CO2 and therefore increase the number of competent formations for secure CO2 storage. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is used to obtain economical rates from tight and unconventional formations by increasing the surface area of the reservoir within the flowing distance to a high-conductivity pathway. However, a significant fraction of the fracturing fluid is never recovered, and thus may reduce the hydrocarbon permeability near the fracture. Here, we experimentally mimic the water-invasion process during fracturing, and measure the effective permeability changes in a low-permeability core. Measurements of water flowback and effective permeability as a function of interfacial tension (IFT), flow rate, and shut-in time suggest that water is being held at the fracture face because of the capillary discontinuity (i.e., when the water leaves the matrix and enters a space with minimal capillary pressure). This effect arises from the capillary interaction between the matrix and the fracture, and is akin to the capillary end effect in coreflood experiments. The results show that this effect, although only a laboratory experimental artifact for conventional reservoirs, can be a significant source of effective hydrocarbon-permeability reduction by fracturing-fluid invasion into the formation in unconventional and tight reservoirs.

Solid particle infiltration is also an active area of research in other fields such as waste water treatment and fines migration in clay-rich reservoirs. In this work, we perform experiments to study particle infiltration into sintered glass bead core plugs and measure the changes in porosity and permeability using computed tomography (CT) scanning and pressure transducers, respectively. Suspensions of prescribed bimodal particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs. Permeability changes are measured continuously over time, and the porosity change is measured after flowing a fixed mass of invaded particles. A dual pore-scale numerical model approach (a combination of a direct pore-scale discrete element method (DEM) and a pore-scale network model) is used to predict permeability reduction by particle filtration in porous media. Large particle deposition is modeled using the DEM in a disordered sphere pack geometry; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of large particle concentration. Small particle deposition is modeled using the network model; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of small particle concentration. Crucially, the geometry of the network model depends on the amount of large particles deposited. In this way, the deposition of large and small sized particles is coupled together. The permeability and porosity reduction of the network due to the deposition of small and large particles are then calculated from the functions above. We compare the experimental results with simulation predictions and find that the dual pore-scale model is capable of predicting the permeability of the invaded core in the regions away from the injection face. Permeability prediction in the region adjacent to the injection face is improved by incorporating the influence of the external filter cake. "

Real-time CT scans are applied to visualize the change of water saturation profile, which is then compared with the regaining of rock permeability. Different surfactants are used to test the effect of IFT reductions and formation of microemulsions; these are further compared in order to explore the best condition that maximizes the permeability enhancement.

Effluent measurements assure that the flow is gravity dominated, and the resulting invasion pattern is measured using X-ray computed tomography (CT).

These three parameters can be substituted to two-phase Darcy Buckingham equation to directly determine relative permeability. To obtain the first two, we use a medical X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) scanner to monitor saturation in time and space, and six differential pressure transducers to measure the overall pressure drop and the pressure drops of five individual sections (divided by four pressure taps on the core) continuously. At each scanning time, the local phase flux is obtained by spatially integrating the saturation profile and converting this to the flux using a fractional flow framework. One advantage of this local method over most previous methods is that the capillary end effect is experimentally avoided; this improvement is crucial for experiments using low viscosity fluids such as supercritical and gas phases. To illustrate the new method, we conduct five CO2-brine primary drainage experiments in a 60.8 cm long and 116 mD Berea sandstone core at 20 °C and 1500 psi. In return, we obtain hundreds of unsteady-state CO2 and brine relative permeability data points that are consistent with steady-state relative permeability data from the same experiments. Due to the large amount of relative permeability data obtained by the new unsteady-state method, the uncertainties of the exponents in the Corey-type fits decrease by up to 90% compared with the steady-state method.

Relative permeabilities are obtained in a 60 cm long vertical Berea sandstone core during gravity drainage, directly from the measured unsteady-state in situ saturations along the core at different times. It is shown that for obtaining relative permeability using this method, if certain criteria are met, the capillary pressure of the rock can be neglected.

                    "abstract": "Three-phase relative permeability can vary greatly from two-phase relative permeability as mechanisms such as flow coupling, double displacement, and layer drainage flow regime play a role in three-phase flow. These are on top of the dependency of three-phase relative permeability on two saturations and saturation path/history. The net result is that it is difficult to model/predict relative permeabilities in three-phase space. In this work, we present three-phase oil relative permeability data measured along 11 saturation paths, in a water-wet consolidated (Berea sandstone) and unconsolidated (sandpack) porous media. These saturation paths cover a wide swath of the three-phase saturation space, providing a better physical understanding of the complete three-phase phase space. Three different oils (crude oil, mineral oil, and n-octane) are used in the experiments; the varying viscosities, spreading coefficients, and composition of the oils allows us to investigate the effect of different drainage mechanisms on relative permeability curves. Our data show that there are significant variations between the curves depending on the media, final water saturation, and fluids. In particular, when the media and fluids are held constant, oil relative permeability can vary an order of magnitude at the same oil saturation, depending on the initial condition and water saturation. We find that within each media, all the curves represent a similar shape, but reach to a different residual saturation. This suggests that residual oil saturation is the key parameter in observed relative permeability differences along different saturation paths. We examine this hypothesis with the most common three-phase relative permeability models, i.e. Saturation Weighted Interpolation, Stone I and II, where we vary residual oil saturation to fit the experimental data. We find that if residual oil saturation is used as a fitting parameter, the models predict experimental data well. Otherwise, without varying residual oil saturation, these relative permeability models perform poorly in predicting experimental data. "

All the experiments were conducted at the fixed CO2 volume fraction (g = 0.75) and fixed flow rate which changed in steps. We started at low flow rates, increased to a medium flow rates followed by decreasing and then increasing into high flow rates. The steady-state foam apparent viscosity was measured as a function of injection velocity. The foam flowing through the cores showed higher foam generation and consequently higher apparent viscosity as the flow rate increased from low to medium and high velocities. At very high velocities, once foam bubbles were finely textured, the foam apparent viscosity was governed by foam shear-thinning rheology rather than foam creation. A noticeable \"hysteresis\" occurred when the flow velocity was initially increased and then decreased, implying multiple (coarse and strong) foam states at the same superficial velocity. A normalized generation function was combined with CMG-STARS foam model to cover the full spectrum of foam flow behavior observed during the experiments. The new foam model successfully captures foam generation and hysteresis trends observed in presented experiments in this study and other foam generation experiments at different operational conditions (e.g. fixed pressure drop at fixed foam quality, and fixed pressure drop at fixed water velocity) from the literature. The results indicate once foam is generated in porous media, it is possible to maintain strong foam at low injection rates. This makes foam more feasible in field applications where foam generation is limited by high injection rates (or high pressure gradient) that may only exist near the injection well. Therefore, understanding of foam generation, and foam hysteresis in porous media and accurate modeling of the process are necessary steps for efficient foam design in field. "

                    "abstract": "Significant amount of fracturing fluid is lost after hydraulic fracturing, and it is believed that the loss of fluid into the matrix can hinder the hydrocarbon production. One way to reduce this damage is to use the surfactants. Robust surfactant formulations have been developed for chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR); similar ideas are introduced in this study to reduce water blocks in low permeability reservoirs. Here we present an experimental investigation based on a coreflood sequence that simulates fluid invasion, flowback, and hydrocarbon production within the rock near the fracture face. Different levels of IFT reductions are tested and compared in order to explore the best condition that maximizes the permeability enhancement. The effect of in-situ microemulsion generation to mobilize the trapped water is also studied. From this work, we recognize the mechanism responsible for the permeability damage in matrix and we suggest criteria to optimize the performance of surfactant additives so as to enhance the hydrocarbon production from low permeability gas/oil reservoirs after hydraulic fracturing.

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of fines into a reservoir during drilling or water reinjection and the accompanying production decline or loss of injectivity, are long-standing problems in the petroleum industry. Here, we propose a methodology that combines two different pore-scale models to better quantify formation damage. Further we validate the proposed model with core flood experiments. We first perform an experimental study of suspension flow into sintered glass bead plugs and measure changes in porosity and permeability. Specifically, glass bead suspensions of known mono- and poly- disperse combinations of particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs, while keeping the total invaded particle volume constant. The resulting changes in porosity and permeability are quantified using a CT scanner and pressure transducers, respectively. We then establish two different numerical models (each focusing on a different mechanism/length scale) to predict permeability reduction. The first model takes a pore-scale approach that models straining of larger particles through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from first principles. The detailed pore structure output from the first model is used as an input in the second model, which is a network model. This pore network model simulates permeability impairment caused by both large and small particles deposition in porous media. Forces exerted on small particles include hydraulic drag, gravity, buoyancy, electric double layer, and Van der Waals. Particle trajectories in a converging- diverging pore throat are calculated dynamically. We incorporate surface roughness and particle-surface interaction to determine particle detachment and attachment. Pore throat structure and hydraulic conductivities are updated dynamically to account for the effect of previously deposited particles. We finally compared the experimental results to simulation predictions and found that the combined pore- scale model is capable of predicting the porosity of the invaded core only in the deeper regions of the core.

The standard experiment for testing imbibition of surfactant solution involves an imbibition cell, in which the core is placed in the surfactant solution and the recovery is measured vs. time. Although these experiments prove the effectiveness of surfactants, little insight into the physics of the problem is achieved. In this study, we performed water and surfactant flooding into oil-wet fractured cores and monitored the imbibition of the surfactant solution by use of computed-tomography (CT) scanning. From the CT images, the surfactant-imbibition dynamics as a function of height along the core was obtained. Although the waterflood only displaced oil from the fracture, the surfactant solution imbibed into the matrix; the imbibition is frontal, with the greatest imbibition rate at the bottom of the core, and the imbibition decreases roughly linearly with height. Experiments with cores of different sizes showed that increase in either the height or the diameter of the core causes decrease in imbibition and fractional oil-recovery rate. We also perform numerical simulations to model the observed imbibition. On the basis of the experimental measurements and numerical-simulation results, we propose a new scaling group that includes both the diameter and the height of the core. We show that the new scaling groups scale the recovery curves better than the traditional scaling group. "

In this paper we present a pore-scale approach that models straining through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from the first principles, enabling the examination of current macroscopic models. While continuum models are widely used for fast prediction of the retention profiles and permeability of the host porous medium, they require a number of phenomenological parameters which are derived from matching experimental results. One of these parameters is the rate of entrapment, which is the sink term in the advection–diffusion equation. Here we find the constitutive relationship for the rate of entrapment as a product of the filtration coefficient, velocity, and concentration and validate it by comparing with core flood experiments. Results show that the pore-scale simulation gives close approximations of filtration coefficient when pore bridging and straining are the main particle capture mechanisms. "

The ongoing search for better solutions has motivated extensive research on alternatives to surfactant-stabilized CO2 foams for CO2 mobility control. The formation of CO2-in-water foams lowers the CO2 mobility, resulting in improvement in sweep efficiency in field tests. The crucial unmet challenge in employing CO2 foams is to maintain long-term stability of foam to achieve high sweep efficiency for the duration of the flooding process. Surfactant-stabilized foams are inherently unstable so that maintenance of the low mobility requires continuous regeneration of lamellae in the small pores of the rock. Nanoparticles can potentially be used to provide much higher foam stability and thus long-term mobility control for CO2 floods. They can act like a foaming surfactant without some of the surfactant drawbacks. Here we present a turnkey approach for using surface treated nanoparticles in reservoirs. This involves: tests for stability in brines, transportability through cores, foam generation in beadpacks and cores when co-injected with CO2, quantification of CO2 viscosity enhancement, and finally modeling of field-scale effects. In this paper, we will outline the key details of nanoparticle design for CO2 EOR. "

                    "abstract": "Relative permeability of oil in water-wet rocks in three-phase systems depends on water saturation in addition to oil saturation. This dependency results in infinite possibilities of combinations of phase saturations in three-phase space, making measurements of three-phase relative permeability difficult and time consuming. Therefore, measurements of changes in three-phase relative permeability in three-phase space are scarce. On the other hand, the existing three-phase relative permeability models for predicting these changes (e. g. hysteresis) are usually complicated and require several parameters. In this work, we measure three-phase oil relative permeability curves along different saturation paths by developing a gravity drainage technique that works in consolidated sandstone. The experiments consist of measuring in-situ saturations along a 2-ft long vertical Berea sandstone core at different times using computed tomography (CT) technique during gravity drainage experiments, along three saturation paths over three-phase space. We then obtain three-phase oil relative permeability directly from the transient in-situ saturations measured during each experiment. Our data show that at the same oil saturation, the three- phase oil relative permeability varies significantly depending on the saturation path in three-phase space. From these measurements we use standard and simple Corey relative permeability model to fit the results. We find that each saturation path exhibits a different residual oil saturation, and that the Corey model matches the data well once the residual oil saturation is given correctly for each saturation path, while keeping all the other parameters constant. Our results suggest that, contrary to previous results, three-phase oil relative permeability in water-wet media is only a function of oil saturation, if the residual oil saturation changes are accounted for accordingly. In other words, we conclude that the key to correctly model three-phase relative permeability is the use of correct residual saturations for each saturation path (history). "

To better understand the nanoparticle retention/transport under high salinity conditions often associated with typical hydrocarbon reservoirs, the aggregation of the surface-treated silica nanoparticles was studied as a function of salinity and nanoparticle concentration. At pH 8.5, an enhancement in aggregation kinetics occurred with increasing calcium and particle concentration. However, when the pH was reduced to ca. 3, close to the CO2 saturated condition, the aggregation was insignificant regardless of the salinity and the particle concentration over 10 days. In the transport test of silica nanoparticles in the sandpack column, a negligible amount of nanoparticles was retained with non-aggregated nanoparticles and for aggregates less than 235 nm regardless of flow rate. However, the retention of larger aggregates (>ca. 1000 nm) was enhanced as Darcy velocity decreased. Modeling based on a modified version of clean-bed filtration theory was able to explain experimental breakthrough curves only for the non-aggregated and slightly aggregated particles, suggesting that further considerations are essential to understand the physical effect of aggregation on the transport of larger aggregates. These results suggest a possible breakdown of the aggregates due to the hydrodynamic forces, hence retrieving the mobility of silica nanoparticles in the porous media. These observations demonstrate that silica nanoparticle aggregation can be prevented by increasing flow rate and lowering pH. The findings of this study would provide an insight on the behavior of nanoparticle in the reservoirs and a guideline for the application of the nanoparticles in enhanced oil recovery operations. "

Although hydraulic fracturing has been successfully applied in unconventional gas production, its limitations are obvious, such as formation damage, water blocking, low stimulating effect and the requirement of sufficient water. To avoid these problems, liquid CO2 has been pumped as a fracturing fluid into unconventional reservoirs. But as a consequence of low density and viscosity of super critical phase CO2 in the formation, CO2 fracturing suffers from low sweep efficiency that manifests as viscous fingering. So various additives have been applied to improve CO2 fracturing effect. This paper introduces a novel additive, nanoparticles, and presents an experiment to evaluate its effect on CO2 fracturing. In this paper, a core flooding experiments was conducted to simulate the fracturing process, in which liquid CO2 was injected into a core to drainage brine or nanoparticles solution. During the process, CO2 distribution and pressure drop were real-time measured with a modified medical CT scanner and pressure transducers. A significant difference is observed between with and without nanoparticles. The saturation files show that CO2 fingering was decreased and the drainage area was improved with the action of nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the CO2 injecting pressure raised, which implies that nanoparticles could offer higher pore pressure in fracturing. These observations suggest that a nanoparticle-stabilized foam is formed between CO2 and nanoparticle solution, which suppress the viscous instability. The results provide nanoparticles are effective to enhance CO2 fracturing.

The method involves in-situ measurements of phase saturation, and a combination of applied steady-state and unsteady-state (gravity drainage) flow to overcome the limitations of previous direct relative permeability measurements. We perform flow experiments in a 1m-long vertical sand-pack; initialized at specific oil saturation. Gas is then allowed to enter, and water and oil are applied from the top at specific rates. The saturation is measured along the sand-pack at different times using computerized tomography scanning. Key to this method is appropriate choice of the applied fluxes. Using a specifically designed code to simulate the experiments, we develop an optimized experimental protocol for the flow rates. With these flow rates, we obtain access to intermediate-saturation region, and we measure three-phase relative permeabilities through imbibition and drainage cycles. Application Three-phase relative permeability is crucial for flow predictions of WAG injection processes. In particular, an understanding of the hysteresis in three-phase relative permeability is essential to describe cyclic processes. Results, Observations, and Conclusions Simulation results show that, we can obtain relative permeabilities for the whole range of saturations for each drainage/imbibition process within 1-3 days. Using the middle 20cm of saturation data avoids the capillary entry and end effects and allows direct calculations. Experimentally, we find that, oil relative permeability increases during the WAG process at different cycles, while the water relative permeability remains constant. Also, residual oil saturations decrease for each cycle. Significance of Subject Matter Previous direct measurements of three-phase relative permeability obtained relative permeabilities only during drainage, and only for low oil saturations (So <0.3). In this work, we extend this direct method to a larger phase space of three-phase saturations by applying external flow rates of water and oil. Using this method allows determination of relative permeabilities during both imbibition and drainage, which is important for cyclic processes such as WAG. The results of this study can be used to optimize WAG cycling, by minimizing the residual oil. "

Water saturation in situ is measured with Computerized Tomography x-ray scanning. The CO2 and brine relative permeabilities are directly calculated with Darcy’s law. Application Accurate determinations of CO2-brine relative permeability are important for modeling potential CO2 storage. This two-phase relative permeability also helps understand and investigate unsteady-state CO2-brine-oil three-phase relative permeability, which is vital in estimating and designing CO2 injection to enhance oil recovery. Results, Observations, and Conclusions (1) The relative permeability to both brine and CO2 of the last section (downstream, 15-cm long) is significantly smaller than that of any of the middle three sections. This testifies that the capillary end effect makes the relative permeability under-measured at the end of a core sample. (2) The values of the middle three sections are very close to each other, which indicate the middle part of our core is free of capillary end effect. (3) The CO2 end point relative permeability is 0.4~0.8, which is much higher than recent published measurements. (4) The brine end point relative permeability during imbibition is about 0.08, which is close to literature data. Significance of subject matter The most common assumption for CO2-brine relative permeability is that it is likely to be similar to oil-brine relative permeability for water-wet rocks. But recent measurements of CO2-brine relative permeability have differed greatly from oil-brine relative permeability; particularly, the measurements show a very low CO2 end point relative permeability (kr,CO2=0.1~0.2) and a relatively high residual water saturation (Swr>0.4) ( Lee et al. 2010, Zuo et al. 2012, Akbarabadi et al. 2013 and etc.). We hypothesize that the differences are caused by large capillary end effects resulted from the very low CO2 viscosity. Our experiments have observed this capillary end effect and measured CO2-brine relative permeability data, which are free of capillary end effect and similar to oil-brine relative permeability. "

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of drilling mud below the bit and into the wellbore wall causes pressure gradients that significantly degrade drilling performance, wellbore stability and production. Due to heterogeneity, standard constitutive relationships and models yield poor predictions for flow (e.g. permeability) and rock properties (e.g. elastic moduli) of the invaded (damaged) formations. This severely reduces our ability to, for instance, estimate pressure build-up, optimize the mud cake properties or predict rock mechanical behavior. We propose a numerical model for permeability estimation in damaged formations near wellbore (e.g. sediments invaded by fines or sand crushing remnants). Grains of two length scales are present, but only larger ones are load-bearing. Detailed cemented granular packs were modeled using a discrete element method software, and ensuring mechanical stability. The particle positions and arrangement were available for subsequent pore throat network analysis. The standard network modeling approach for analysis of packing of nearly equal grains (Delaunay tessellation) cannot be used since grains of two different length scales create a high fraction of distorted pores. The main novelty of this work is adapting the network flow model to work with two length scales, and we present both the network creation and flow model in the multi-scale case. The effects of particle size and initial formation porosity on formation damage are studied in detail. Our study confirms that large particles tend to occupy the formation face, while small particles invade deep into the formation. Moreover, particles which are smaller than pore throats (entrances) impair permeability more than those larger than pore throats. Our study also indicates that a higher initial formation porosity leads to more particle invasion and permeability impairment. Thus in order to reduce formation damage, mud particle size distributions should be carefully selected according to given formation properties. "

This strategy increases the sweep efficiency of CO2 storage in aquifers and enhances the aquifer storage security. The most likely mechanism is the generation of nanoparticle stabilized CO2/water foam which securely traps the injected CO2 for long periods of time. As a consequence of low density and viscosity of CO2 at typical geologic storage conditions, CO2 injection into aquifers suffers from low sweep efficiency which manifests as the gravity override and viscous fingering. Here, we show that nanoparticles can reduce the mobility of the injected CO2 as it displaces brine, and therefore, increase the sweep efficiency. Further we show that displacing the injected CO2 with brine increases residual phase saturations, and therefore enhance the capillary trapping of CO2. We conducted core flooding experiments in which liquid CO2 was used to displace brine with and without suspended nanoparticles. Sandstone cores with different degrees of heterogeneity were used to capture the effect of heterogeneity on the efficiency of the proposed technique. Saturation distributions and pressure drops were measured in real time with a modified medical CT scanner and pressure transducers. The use of nanoparticles is shown to render about 90% of the injected CO2 immobile and increases the sweep efficiency up to 20% when compared to the base brine case. "

These empirical models are usually tested against available steady-state data. However, the oil flow is transient during various production stages [e.g., gas injection after waterflood and steamassisted gravity drainage (SAGD)]. Hence, there is a need to test the empirical models against unsteady-state or transient data. We compare two sets of three-phase oil-permeability data measured during tertiary gasflood. The first data set, which was recently published (Dehghanpour et al. 2011a), is measured during transient gravity-drainage experiments, and will be detailed further here. The second set was measured by Oak et al. (1990) during steady-state corefloods. We compare the two data sets with the corresponding two-phase permeability curves, and observe different qualitative behaviours. The comparison indicates that during steady-state tertiary gasflood, the presence and flow of water restrict the oil flow, while during transient tertiary gasflood, water-saturation drop enhances the oil flow. We test the performance of well-known empirical models further in predicting the two data sets, and explain how Stone I and saturation-weighted interpolation (SWI) should be used to usefully predict oil permeability during a three-phase tertiary displacement.

                    "abstract": "Surface-treated nanoparticles have been shown to stabilize CO2-in-water foam by adhering to the surface of CO2 bubbles and preventing their coalescence. However, to bring the nanoparticles from the bulk phase to CO2/water interface requires an input of mechanical energy. Co-injection of CO2 and an aqueous dispersion of nanoparticles at high rates is known to provide sufficient energy. However, this co-injection is less favorable because of the operational constraint, i.e., injectivity reduction. Here, we show that beneficial effect of nanoparticles, manifested as improved sweep efficiency, occurs even at low shear rates in a drainage displacement. We inject high-pressure liquid CO2 into sandstone cores initially saturated with brine containing suspended nanoparticles and compare the results with the case with no nanoparticle addition.  The water saturation distribution was measured using CT scanning techniques. The results show that the nanoparticles increase sweep efficiency and reduce the gravity override compared to displacements without nanoparticles. The new mechanism described here provides a promising alternative for mobility control in CO2 floods. Introduction Carbon dioxide injection to recover oil from mature oil reservoirs (\"CO2 flooding??) has been used for over 40 years (Grigg & Schechter, 1997; Jarrell, et al., 2002). CO2 flooding is now more economically and environmentally viable, because of the high crude oil price and possible large anthropogenic CO2 sources through carbon capture (Enick & Olsen, 2011). Despite its good local displacement efficiency, CO2 flooding suffers from poor sweep efficiency due to CO2's very low viscosity. Therefore, efficiency of a CO2 flood can be improved if the mobility of the CO2 is effectively reduced (Lake, 1989).  Previous attempts for controlling CO2 mobility by using CO2 direct thickener (Bae & Irani, 1990) or gels (Wagner & Weisrock, 1986), and making foam with surfactants (Rossen, 1996), have made progress, but still have issues to be worked out. For instance, despite over 40 years of research, no CO2 direct thickener, which could be economically injected, has been found. In addition, surfactant stabilized foam, by its nature, is unstable, and the efficiency of the surfactant under harsh reservoir conditions (high temperature and high salinity) is questionable (Rossen, 1996). Therefore, other more robust methods that can control the mobility of CO2 effectively and affordably are required. Here, we studied possible use of engineered nanoparticles in controlling the mobility of CO2 by spontaneous formation of stable CO2/water foam. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Injecting nanoparticles into the subsurface can have a potential impact on altering both oil recovery and/or CO2 sequestration. In this work we conduct core floods in which a CO2-analogue fluid (n-octane) displaces brine with and without dispersed nanoparticles. We find that the floods with nanoparticles cause a greater pressure drop, and a change in flow pattern compared to the floods without. Emulsion formation is inferred by measuring the saturation distribution and pressure drop along the core. The results suggest that nanoparticle stabilized emulsion is formed during a drainage process (at low shear rate condition) which acts to reduce the mobility of the injected fluid.  We also perform imbibition experiments, where the nanoparticle dispersion in brine displaces noctane. Here we observe little difference in the flow pattern and pressure drop as a function of nanoparticle concentration. There is an observed accumulation of nanoparticles at the imbibition front, which suggests that nanoparticles may be used as a tracer of the displacement front.   Introduction There has been great recent interest in the potential use of nanoparticles in the subsurface. In drilling fluids, nanoparticles have been shown to be very effective in lowering the permeability of shales, helping to block water invasion and weakening of the shale walls (Ali, et al., 2004; Temple, et al., 2005). Additionaly, if the surface charge of the nanoparticles is altered so that there is an electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles, the particles will stay in aqueous suspension do to Brownian motion (Brant, et al., 2007). When a suspension of these treated nanoparticles is passed through a permeable media with micron sized pores, there is no effective straining of the nanoparticles (Zhang, et al., 2010; Espinosa, et al., 2010). This is unlike colloidal particles, as nanoparticles are roughly 2 orders of magnitude smaller than colloidal particles. The ability to transport unhindered through porous media has opened up possibilities of remotely sensing the position of the ferromagnetic nanoparticles (Yu, et al., 2010).  In addition to the transport properties, nanoparticles have been shown to stabilize emulsions and foams as a Pickering emulsion. This is depicted in Fig. 1 for CO2 and water phases. If the surface coating is such that the nanoparticle has an acute contact angle, the sum total of many nanoparticles will cause the interface to curve towards the CO2, and thus stabilize a CO2-in-water emulsion (Zhang, et al., 2009). If the contact angle is obtuse, the sum total of many nanoparticles will stabilize a water-in-CO2 emulsion. Appropriate surface coating also reduces the aggregation and retention of the nanoparticle in the porous media (Rodriguez, et al., 2009; Caldelas, et al., 2011). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We investigated the ability of a dispersion of specially surface-treated nanoparticles to stabilize an oil/water emulsion of prescribed internal structure created by flow within a fracture. We hypothesize that for a set of conditions (nanoparticle concentration, salinity, aqueous to organic phase ratio) a critical shear rate exists. That is, for flow rates that exceed this critical shear rate, an emulsion can be created.  Flow experiments were conducted within fractured cylinders of Boise sandstone and of Class H cement. The Boise sandstone core (D = 1 in and L = 12 in) was cut down its length and propped open to a specific aperture with beads. The fracture was saturated with dodecane which was displaced with nanoparticle dispersion, and vice versa while pressure drop across the fracture was recorded. Class H cement cylinders (D = 1 in and L = 3 in) were allowed to set, then failed in tension to create a rough-walled fracture along their length. These fractured cement cylinders were then sealed and encased in epoxy to isolate the fractures. CT scans of the encased fractures were used to determine the aperture width, which is utilized when calculating the shear rate inside of the fracture maintained during an experiment. A dispersion of surface-modified silica nanoparticles and decane were co-injected into both the Boise sandstone and cement fractures and the pressure drop was measured across the fractures at a variety of shear rates. The effluent of each experiment was collected in sample tubes.  Observation of the effluent and pressure drop data both support our hypothesis of emulsion generation being possible once a critical shear rate has been reached. Alteration of the injected phase ratio and increased residence time of the two phases inside of a fracture both affect the amount of emulsification occurring within the fractures. Increasing the residence time of both phases within a fracture allows for more opportunities for emulsification to occur, resulting in a greater amount of emulsion to be generated. Injection of high or low volumetric ratios of nanoparticle dispersion to organic phase results in little amounts of emulsion generation; however, between the nanoparticle dispersion to organic phase ratios of 0.25:1 and 2:1 significant amounts of emulsion are generated once a critical shear rate has been reached.  Introduction The ability of surface-modified nanoparticles to stabilize oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions offers a variety of oilfield application possibilities, e.g., as mobility control and conformance control agents, and as constituents for drilling mud or well completions cement. Much work has been done in generating, characterizing, and developing applications of, the nanoparticle-stabilized oil-water emulsions that are known generally to have robust stability (see e.g., Binks et al., 2008), but the use of nanoparticle-stabilized emulsions is a fairly new area of interest for oil industry (Zhang et al., 2010). In view of their long-term stability and ability to create very low mobility, such emulsions could be very useful in blocking the fractures often encountered in subsurface formations or those accidentally created in casing cement, especially if the emulsion can be generated spontaneously in situ in the fracture. With such potential applications in mind, we investigated the conditions under which surface-modified nanoparticle-stabilized oil-water emulsions can be generated inside of a rough-walled fracture.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Gas or steam gravity drainage is a very efficient recovery mechanism. Field observations, laboratory studies and pore network modeling have pointed towards very low residual oil saturations and high recovery with gravity drainage. While work during the last three decades has focused on understanding the physics of three??phase flow, literature on field scale gravity drainage production decline characteristics is somewhat limited. Understanding field level production decline characteristics is important as it enables better production forecasting, resource estimation and reservoir management.  In this paper production data from two fields under gravity drainage is evaluated and it shows strong exponential decline characteristics. After an initial period of rapid decline, there is a period of lower decline for a long period of time. The paper relates field scale observations of gravity drainage to laboratory observations of gravity drainage in long cores. The laboratory experiments show similar behaviors where a period of initial rapid decline is followed by a long period of lower decline, resulting in very low remaining oil saturation in the gas invaded zone. The paper discusses physics of gravity drainage displacement and summarizes similarities and differences between field and laboratory observations.  Introduction Gravity drainage is a very efficient mechanism of oil recovery, and typically is associated with gas injection or gas cap expansion in an oil reservoir. Free fall gravity drainage, as described in this paper, assumes no impact of viscous forces from forced injection. The only resistance is from capillary forces which depends on rock and fluid properties and their interactions [1]. An expanding gas cap or steam chest because of reservoir depletion would be an example of free fall gravity drainage. Published field observations of free fall gravity drainage production and decline analysis are limited [2, 3, 4, 5], and the emphasis is more on ultimate recovery than production decline characteristics.  Since free fall gravity drainage generates some of the highest reported recoveries, it is important to get a more comprehensive understanding of the field recovery mechanism, production decline characteristics and relate these to more widely studied laboratory, analytical and simulation studies of gravity drainage [6, 7]. This is the primary goal of the paper, which starts by describing field observations of production decline in well characterized gravity drainage reservoirs and then relates the field observations to carefully conducted laboratory gravity drainage experiments.  The laboratory experiments of gravity drainage are conducted in long cores/sandpacks, which are CT??scanned to estimate in??situ saturation changes and three??phase relative permeability. We provide a qualitative framework that ties some of the field and laboratory observations under free fall gravity drainage, without going into process modeling or history matching.  It should also be noted that the rock and fluid properties used in the one??dimensional laboratory experiments are not the same as those in the field observations. However, the laboratory experiments do allow for 3??phase (oil, gas and water) flow and have gravity dominated displacement as observed in the field. "

Previously, in Part 1 in a series of papers, we proposed analytic solutions for capillary/gravity equilibrium (CGE) in compositional gravity drainage and estimated the total recovery of wetting phase (DiCarlo and Orr 2007). In Part 2, we presented the results of experiments in an analog brine/isopropanol (IPA)/isooctane (IC8) system in which the vertical profile of the components was measured destructively after 3 weeks of drainage (DiCarlo et al. 2007). Here, we present numerical simulations of compositional gravity drainage. We find that the CGE solutions are approached asymptotically as the simulation grid is refined for a simplified phase diagram. For vaporizing drainages, a bank of wetting fluid is found to be created from early times in the drainage because of wetting fluid imbibing back into swept regions. We show that including hysteresis in the capillary pressure curve limits the creation of the wetting-fluid bank. We compare the numerical simulations to the experimental observations and find that the simulations match well for condensing drainages but not for vaporizing drainages, similar to what is seen for the CGE solutions.

Before dissociation, we use X-ray CT to measure hydrate volume and surface area in the sand and find [hydrate volume]2/3 is a linear approximation of hydrate surface area regardless of differences in hydrate specific area. During dissociation, we use X-ray radiography to quantify the evolutions of hydrate volume and dissociation rate. We find [hydrate volume]2/3 (i.e., hydrate surface area) is a linear metric of hydrate dissociation rate. Additionally we observe two circumstances when dissociate rate is not linear with [hydrate volume]2/3. First, above a critical hydrate saturation of 35–45%, hydrate dissociation rate initially stays constant and then decreases with [volume]2/3. Second, the dissociation rates of patchy hydrates in large pores initially stay constant and are significantly slower than hydrates in small pores with the same sizes. Since methane hydrates in nature are patchy and heterogeneously distributed, the new knowledge will facilitate modeling of hydrates production with a simple metric of dissociation rate (i.e., [volume]2/3) and constraints of hydrate saturation and pore size.

We propose a grain crushing model with two-sized subgrains based on the discrete element method and bonded-particle model (DEM-BPM) and perform numerical single grain crushing tests to calibrate the model parameters against the experimental sand grain characteristic strength. Numerical uniaxial strain tests are used to predict porosity and permeability reduction caused by reservoir compaction. Grain crushing incurs a significant reduction of porosity under the uniaxial strain stress path, which becomes more evident for digital samples consisting of larger grains. The stress-dependent changes in porosity and permeability obtained from the DEM simulations can be used as inputs for a reservoir-scale correlation to predict the productivity loss due to reservoir compaction.

The induced mineral-brine-CO2 reactions can alter the reservoir rock strength and deformational behavior, which subsequently affects CO2 storage mechanical integrity. This study attempts to investigate quantitatively the effect of mineral cement and particle dissolution through numerical modeling and validation of triaxial tests performed on unaltered and geologically altered Entrada Sandstone. We utilize a numerical model that couples the discrete element method (DEM) and the bonded-particle model (BPM) to perform simulations of triaxial tests on synthetic rocks that mimic tested rock samples under various confining stresses. Numerical results, in agreement with experimental evidence, show that both cement and particle dissolution significantly contribute to rock weakening in sandstone samples with carbonate/hematite cements and pore-filling carbonate. Sensitivity analyses show that the brittleness of DEM numerical samples is mostly conditioned by the cement bond size among all cement microscopic parameters. An alteration path that mimics the mineral dissolution under subsurface boundary conditions leads to (1) vertical compaction and horizontal stress relaxation in the reservoir rock and (2) transfer of stresses to adjacent strata that results in bond breakage and potentially natural fracture reactivation at a large scale.

                    "abstract": "CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers results in acidification of resident brine. Chemical reactions between acidified brine and rock minerals lead to dissolution and precipitation of minerals at various time scales. Mineral dissolution and precipitation are often neglected in assessing the mechanical integrity of target storage formations, yet, changes in rock strength and deformational behavior can impact trapping mechanisms. This study shows the impact of exposure to CO2-charged brine on shear strength and stiffness of various outcrop rocks evaluated through triaxial testing. The tested rocks were exposed to CO2-charged brine over geological time at a naturally occurring near-surface seepage along the Little Grand Wash Fault and Salt Wash Grabens, which include the Crystal Geyser site near the town of Green River, Utah. Prior work suggests that this site provides a near-surface structural analog for possible fault-controlled CO2 leakage over time scales that exceed expected injection time scales (10–100 years). Results show mechanical alteration in various aspects: (1) CO2-charged brine alteration at near-surface conditions results in mineral dissolution/precipitation and reduction of shear strength and brittleness of Entrada sandstone and Summerville siltstone samples, and (2) carbonate precipitation in fractured Mancos shale leads to matrix stiffening and fracture mineralization resulting in overall stiffer and likely tighter shale. Additional discrete element simulations coupled with a bonded-particle-model confirm the role of cement bond size alteration as one of the main controls for rock chemo-mechanical alteration in sandstones. The chemo-mechanical alteration path that mimics cement dissolution (under stressed subsurface conditions) results in vertical compaction and lateral stress relaxation. Overall, results show that rock exposure to CO2-charged brine can impart distinct petrophysical and geomechanical changes according to rock lithology and location with respect to major CO2 conduits. While mineral dissolution in the storage rock may result in undesired reservoir strains and changes of stresses, mineral precipitation downstream from a leakage path can help seal potentially induced fractures.

                    "abstract": "Water alternating gas (WAG) injection is a common technique in enhanced oil recovery. However, gas injection often associates with fingering due to high gas mobility, which leaves a large portion of the reservoir unswept. This study addresses gas mobility control observations through novel X-ray microfocus visualization of core-flood experiments and interpretation aided by numerical simulation. We use foam as our primary mobility control agent for improving conformance. The experimental setup utilizes an automated fluid injection system monitored by an X-ray microfocus scanner to quantify displacement patterns and saturations during WAG core-flood experiments. The core-flood device – placed within an X-ray shielded cabinet – is wirelessly operated through a computer. The resolution of the images permits observation of not only core scale fingering but also pore-scale displacement. We use a metastable foam with surfactant dissolved in the liquid phase to stabilize the gas diffusion in the liquid and to decrease the permeability and/or lower the apparent gas viscosity. Results show that saturation patterns and displacement front during WAG injection are highly influenced by bedding orientation and rock heterogeneity. Without gas mobility control during WAG injection, fingering and early breakthrough occur in those cases in which bedding orientation facilitates gas to flow through high permeability layers. In these cases, sweep efficiency is low during early time injection of nitrogen and only improves after injection is prolonged. With gas mobility control, the displacement efficiency is significantly improved. Also, dynamic processes like phase trapping, which could severely impair permeability and overall sweep efficiency, is more clearly visualized with the microfocus technique. Simulation work matches experimental data well and replicates saturation patterns measured experimentally in laminated Berea sandstone samples. The novel visualization technique presented here provides new pore-scale experimental insight to quantifying WAG displacement in heterogeneous media, a resolution one order of magnitude higher than with medical X-ray CT or other core-scale visualization techniques. The findings are useful for understanding flow regimes in structurally complex and heterogeneous formations. "

                    "abstract": "Clathrate hydrate is a solid crystalline compound that consists of water cages with trapped gas molecules. Methane hydrate in permafrost and marine sediments is estimated to contain 2 × 103 to 4 × 106 Gt of carbon, which makes it both a potential energy source and a liability to global warming. The transport and mechanical properties of hydrate bearing sediments (HBS), and therefore hydrate dissociation through depressurization, thermal stimulation, or CO2 injection, depend on hydrate pore habit and spatial distribution in sediments. However, the evolution of hydrate pore habit and spatial distribution in HBS are not well understood yet. Here we show experimental evidence of Ostwald ripening of gas hydrate crystals in pores and porous media. We find that (1) hydrate growth rate (under nearly isothermal conditions) versus the degree of overpressurization fits an Arrhenius-type equation, and (2) Ostwald ripening gradually changes hydrate pore habit from grain-attaching to pore-filling and increases hydrate saturation heterogeneity at both pore and core scales. The latter ultimately creates significant spatial variations of permeability and sediment strength. Our results provide insights into kinetics and pore-scale physics that determine the geophysical signature from HBS at various scales. Based on our findings of hydrate occurrence in both gas and gas-water interface, we argue that hydrate growth in natural HBS is not limited to the water liquid phase. Our observation of hydrate pore habit alteration by Ostwald ripening explains patchy saturation and heterogeneous distribution of hydrate in natural HBS, which gives physical insight to improve geophysical hydrate models in porous media.

                    "abstract": "Subsurface CO2 injection and storage alters formation pressure. Changes of pore pressure may result in fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing if the pressure exceeds the corresponding thresholds. Most simulation models predict such thresholds utilizing relatively homogeneous reservoir rock models and do not account for CO2 dissolution in the brine phase to calculate pore pressure evolution. This study presents an estimation of reservoir capacity in terms of allowable injection volume and rate utilizing the Frio CO2 injection site in the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as a case study. The work includes laboratory core testing, well-logging data analyses, and reservoir numerical simulation. We built a fine-scale reservoir model of the Frio pilot test in our in-house reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We first performed history matching of the pressure transient data of the Frio pilot test, and then used this history-matched reservoir model to investigate the effect of the CO2 dissolution into brine and predict the implications of larger CO2 injection volumes. Our simulation results –including CO2 dissolution– exhibited 33% lower pressure build-up relative to the simulation excluding dissolution. Capillary heterogeneity helps spread the CO2 plume and facilitate early breakthrough. Formation expansivity helps alleviate pore pressure build-up. Simulation results suggest that the injection schedule adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not affect the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Fault reactivation requires injection volumes of at least about sixty times larger than the actual injected volume at the same injection rate. Hydraulic fracturing necessitates much larger injection rates than the ones used in the Frio pilot test. Tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in-situ effective stresses. Hence, we do not expect an increase of fault permeability in the Frio sand even in the presence of fault reactivation. "

                    "abstract": "Organic shale reservoirs accommodate large amounts of hydrocarbons in extremely tight rock matrix. Slick water hydraulic fracturing and proppant placement is the most spread stimulating technology for this type of reservoirs. Some shale formations contain a fair amount of easily-dissolvable carbonates, which prompts shale acidizing as a potential method to increase reservoir permeability. Carbonates in shale formations can be present as a part of rock matrix or can be localized in natural fractures — so-called mineral veins. Previous studies investigated the effects of chemical dissolution within the matrix, implying that acidizing can etch the rock, open new conduits for flow, and increase fracture permeability after closure. This study rather focuses on the reservoir-scale geomechanical implications of chemical dissolution of mineral filling in natural fractures. We use a combination of elasto-plastic analytical methods, analogous thermo-elastic numerical solutions, and experimental results to elucidate the impact of veins dissolution on in-situ stresses. Analytical, numerical, and experimental results indicate that mineral dissolution of localized carbonate fractures leads to changes of local in-situ stresses. The direction of stress relaxation strongly depends on the orientation of mineralized fractures. Dissolution of near-vertical mineralized fractures contributes the most to decreases of effective horizontal stress and reduce stress shadow effects in multistage hydraulic fracture completions. Mineral dissolution, similar to pore pressure depletion or thermal cooling/heating, can increase stress anisotropy, which can reactivate critically-oriented natural fractures. In-situ stress chemical manipulation can be used advantageously to enlarge the stimulated reservoir volume. "

                    "abstract": "Small pores in high specific surface clay-rich caprocks give rise to high capillary entry pressures and high viscous drag that hinder the migration of buoyant carbon dioxide CO2. We measured the breakthrough pressure and ensuing CO2 permeability through sediment plugs prepared with sand, silt, kaolinite and smectite, and monitored their volumetric deformation using high-pressure oedometer cells. The data show water expulsion and volumetric contraction prior to CO2 breakthrough, followed by preferential CO2 flow thereafter. Our experimental results and data gathered from previous studies highlight the inverse relationship between breakthrough pressure and pore size, as anticipated by Laplace’s equation. In terms of macro-scale parameters, the breakthrough pressure increases as the sediment specific surface increases and the porosity decreases. The breakthrough pressure is usually lower than the values predicted with average pore size estimations; it can reach ∼6.2 MPa in argillaceous formations, and 11.2 MPa in evaporites. The CO2 permeability after breakthrough is significantly lower than the absolute permeability, but it may increase in time due to water displacement and desiccation. Leakage will be advection-controlled once percolation takes place at most storage sites currently being considered. Diffusive and advective CO2 leaks through non-fractured caprocks will be minor and will not compromise the storage capacity at CO2 injection sites. The “sealing number” and the “stability number” combine the initial fluid pressure, the buoyant pressure caused by the CO2 plume, the capillary breakthrough pressure of the caprock, and the stress conditions at the reservoir depth; these two numbers provide a rapid assessment of potential storage sites. Unexpected CO2 migration patterns emerge due to the inherent spatial variability and structural discontinuities in geological formations; sites with redundant seal layers should be sought for the safe and long-term storage of CO2.

                    "abstract": "The geologic sequestration of CO2 is a potential solution for decreasing anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 emissions by trapping it underground. A primary mechanism for storage is structural trapping where low permeability and high capillary entry pressure caprock materials hold back the buoyant CO2 from rising to the surface. The wettability (or contact angle) of reservoir and caprock materials in relation to CO2 and formation brine partly determines the efficiency of structural trapping. Current practice applies the results of individual reservoir-comprising minerals recorded under laboratory conditions, to rocks under in-situ reservoir conditions. However, the wide variety of measured contact angles reported in the literature calls this practice into question. Moreover, organic shales have not been the focus of systematic studies. Here we analyzed the wettability of CO2 on organic shales at various organic matter concentrations and thermal maturities. We found that bulk organic shale remains highly water wet with respect to CO2 despite changes to the maturity or concentration of organics. This finding is in contrast to recent molecular dynamic simulations and our initial expectations from previous pore-scale analyses in which organic matter was shown to be hydrophobic. The results are likely due to the remaining mineralogy of the rock dominating the wetting behavior despite concentrations of organics up to 7.9%. This means that reservoirs and aquifers capped by organic rich caprocks may be suitable locations for CO2 storage and that organic matter at concentrations below percolation threshold may not have a detrimental effect on structural trapping efficiency.

The injection of CO2 can alter mechanical properties of the host geological formation due to the interaction between CO2, resident fluid in the pores, and rock minerals. However, the underlying mechanism responsible for such alterations are still not fully understood. This study explores mechanisms of rock alteration due to exposure to CO2-rich brine through the modeling and analysis of micro-scratch tests. The discrete element method (DEM) and bonded-particle model (BPM) are used to perform numerical modeling of the scratch test simulating a sphero-conical stylus scratch on a random packing of bonded spherical grains. The microscopic parameters used in DEM/BPM are calibrated by conducting numerical triaxial compression tests. Numerical results of the scratch test are compared against experimental results on Entrada sandstone. Scratch toughness is correlated positively with the cement bond size, which appears to be the most appropriate parameter to explain the alteration of Entrada sandstone caused by CO2. There appears to be a transition from brittle to ductile failure in the scratch failure mode as the bond size decreases. This work provides insight on how microscopic bond properties alters macroscopic mechanical properties of cemented sandstones. 1. INTRODUCTION CO2 capture and sequestration in deep geologic formations is considered as an economical and environmentally sound approach to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption. The injection of CO2 into host formations will shift the subsurface geochemical conditions away from equilibrium. This shift can lead to reactions between rock minerals and CO2-water mixtures (Hovorka et al., 2006, 2013; Bachu et al., 2007; Carroll et al., 2011). The petrophysical and geomechanical properties of reservoir and caprock formations at CO2 storage sites can be significantly altered due to long-term contact with CO2-rich brine (Rutqvist and Tsang, 2002; Espinoza et al., 2011; Rinehart et al., 2014; Renard et al., 2008; Rohmer et al., 2016). Chemo-mechanical coupled processes are expected to be triggered by CO2 injection into brine aquifers. For example, chemically aided fracture growth could be a detriment to caprock integrity, facilitating leaks of buoyant CO2. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Layering-induced anisotropy of shale formations increases uncertainty in determining in-situ mechanical properties and stresses, thus increasing the risk associated with implementing advanced drilling and hydraulic stimulation in shales. We conduct simultaneous triaxial stress tests and ultrasonic wave propagation monitoring to quantify static and dynamic stiffness anisotropy in Mancos Shale. Two case studies evidence the impacts of (1) confining stress and (2) presence of pre-existing fractures, on dynamic-static transforms of Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios with increasing deviatoric stress. The first case shows that confining stress more heavily impacts dynamic mechanical properties than static. The effect is most prominent at high deviatoric stresses, where stress-induced damage increases the difference between dynamic and static Young’s moduli. The second case shows that samples with pre-existing fractures exhibit even higher differences between dynamic and static Young’s moduli than non-fractured (intact) and damaged rocks. Fractured samples exhibit ratios of Edyn/Est between 5:1 and 7:1, whereas intact samples generally remain near the 3:1 ratio. Pre- and post-test X-ray microtomography imaging confirm that bedding planes and pre-existing fractures act as planes of weakness, while sample layering causes mechanical stratigraphy, where changes in lithology may cause fractures to reorient. Results highlight the limitations of tangent linear elasticity moduli to explain complex deformational behavior in shales and the need for better models that address the strain-magnitude dependence of rock properties. 1. INTRODUCTION Shale layering causes bed-parallel differences in rock properties, a component of mechanical stratigraphy (Laubach et al. 2009). Stratigraphic variations in mechanical properties are known to influence the growth of engineered fractures (Bosziak et al. 2014). A further element of bed-perpendicular anisotropy can be introduced by pre-existing fractures, which can impact rock stress-strain response (Bergbauer and Pollard 2004). Over geologic time, subsurface stresses may vary, which can cause natural fracturing. Chemical alteration (diagenesis) might stiffen natural fractures, therefore their orientations might not be aligned with current stresses or layering (Laubach et al. 2004). Consequently, the attributes and orientation of layering and diagenetically altered open fractures can impact rock mechanical behavior, engineered fracture growth, and rock failure under a range of loading paths. Layering and pre-existing fractures are suspected to influence the behavior of shales undergoing hydraulic fracture treatment (Suarez-Rivera et al. 2013, Gale et al. 2014). "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Up to 2015, about 5 million metric tons of CO2 have been injected into the Lower Tuscaloosa sandstone at Cranfield field, Mississippi. Pressure monitoring at one injection well shows that the bottom-hole pressure did not increase with the imposed injection rates as expected. Above the injection zone, pressure gauges measured a change of pore pressure of approximately 0.1 MPa in the absence of leaks. These two unexpected responses during the injection suggest potential geomechanical events induced by CO2 injection. We conducted triaxial tests in Tuscaloosa sandstone rock samples with CO2-acidified brine in order to understand chemo-poromechanical processes that may have contributed to these unexpected responses. Experimental results include measurements of permeability, relative permeabilities, quasi-static and dynamic elastic moduli, Biot coefficient, and chemically-induced creep at in-situ reservoir stresses. Results show a marked anisotropy in transport properties originated from features up to the scale of a few millimeters. Rock samples exhibited significant plastic strains upon loading and yield stress consistent with current burial depth. Creep rate increases more than one order of magnitude after CO2 injection. Chemically-induced creep deformation seems insufficient to cause significant reservoir compaction but may have contributed to horizontal stress relaxation. 1. INTRODUCTION Carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage can help reduce CO2 emissions by disposal into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and deep saline aquifers. However, injecting large amounts of CO2 at high injection rates may upset the geomechanical equilibrium of the host formation. CO2 has been injected for CO2 enhanced oil recovery (4.5 million metric tons of CO2) and geological storage (0.5 million metric tons of CO2 in the water leg) at Cranfield site in Mississippi (Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership - www.secarbon.org). CO2 injection and storage in the water leg used one injection well (CFU31F-1) and two monitoring wells (CFU31F-2 and CFU31F-3) (Lu et al., 2012a; Butsch et al., 2013; Hovorka et al. 2013). "

                    "abstract": "Long-term pore pressure depletion significantly alters reservoir stresses, which are known to have a substantial impact on permeability in fractured reservoirs. Increased effective stresses resulting from depletion often induce a decrease in permeability. The opposite has been observed in some reservoirs with an organic rock matrix that exhibits strong sorption-mechanical coupling. With depletion, adsorbed gas desorbs from micropores resulting in shrinkage of the rock matrix, relaxation of effective stresses, and opening of fractures. In addition, reservoir depletion results in an increased stress anisotropy, which may lead to potential reactivation of critically oriented natural fractures and shear failure. The objective of this study is to develop a reservoir simulator with a full poromechanical coupling accounting for sorption-induced change of stresses, shear failure, fines production, and their effect on permeability. This paper aims to estimate the influence of the various mechanical and transport parameters affecting reservoir permeability and to predict its evolution during reservoir depletion. We compare two natural gas reservoirs with strong (San Juan coal basin) and weak (Barnett shale formation) sorption-mechanical coupling. The results of the study highlight the interplay between mechanical moduli, swelling isotherm parameters, fracture compressibility, and rock strength in determining their impact on fracture permeability evolution during depletion. We show that simple stress-dependent permeability models cannot capture permeability evolution in the presence of shear failure and fines production. A modified permeability equation is introduced to describe fines migration and shear dilation. Numerical simulation confirmed that desorption-induced strains in shales may induce changes of horizontal stresses of several MPa. These changes of stress may have a minor effect on permeability but can significantly affect horizontal stress anisotropy and should be considered while planning refracturing. "

                    "abstract": "Targeting the incompatibility issue between traditional Portland cements and non-aqueous drilling muds, a mud solidification technique based on geopolymer cements was recently introduced to the industry. This technique was achieved by incorporating non-aqueous fluids (NAF) such as synthetic-based or oil-based drilling mud in a geopolymer cement that is formed by blending an aluminosilicate powder with an alkaline activating solution. In a previously completed study, the consolidated mud, or \"geopolymer hybrid\", was evaluated for its compressive strength, thickening time and stability for applications including primary cementing as well as lost circulation control. In an effort to further develop the geopolymer hybrid system as a new generation well cementing material, the present work comprehensively studies their mechanical properties, self-healing capabilities and cement-to-pipe bond strength. One of the concerns currently preventing the use of geopolymers for well cementing is its low early compressive strength. This study shows that although the early age uniaxial compressive strength of geopolymer is lower than that of Portland cement, with an applied confining stress, geopolymers have more than sufficient strength for primary cementing applications. Furthermore, the abilities of cement to properly bond with steel casing and rock formations, as well as to withstand subsurface stress changes over time are of paramount importance for long-term cement integrity. The triaxial tests performed in this study show that geopolymers are less brittle than Portland cement, and can therefore accommodate stress changes without localized failure. The geopolymer bond strength measurements showed that geopolymer could bond to steel even in presence of non-aqueous drilling muds. In addition, the triaxial tests revealed that geopolymers exhibit true self-healing capabilities, characterized by samples fully regaining their mechanical competence with 28 day post-failure strength exceeding the native 7-day strength. Portland cement, in comparison, retained lower ultimate strength than its 7-day strength. The self-healing capability of geopolymers is ideally suited to adapt to subsurface stress changes, making such materials ideally suited for use as permanent barriers in plug and abandonment operations.

                    "abstract": "CO2 geological sequestration is one of the most efficient and direct ways to reduce the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Understanding reservoir capacity and geomechanical implications of CO2 injection are necessary for safe and effective storage. Large pore pressure increases from injection may induce fault reactivation and seal failure, and compromise storage integrity. Several studies examined the Frio brine pilot CO2 sequestration project conducted in Dayton, Texas. However, geomechanical implications were not fully evaluated at that time besides calculations required for a class V well permit. This article presents a comprehensive case study to evaluate pore pressure increase due to CO2 injection at the Frio injection site. The work includes new laboratory experiments and well-logging data analyses. The results are consistently assimilated into a numerical reservoir model which includes compositional flow. A fine-scale reservoir model of the Frio pilot test is developed in our in-house reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We perform history matching of the pressure transient data of Frio pilot test, and the history-matched reservoir model is used to predict the implications of larger CO2 injection volumes. Reservoir simulation results show that injection rates adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not upset the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Higher and sustained injection rates may increase pore pressure beyond limits for fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing. A change of over a few-hundreds-psi could cause the sand to reach the shear yield stress. However, tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in-situ effective stresses suggesting that reaching shear yield stress in neighboring faults may not jeopardize the sealing integrity of faults.

The first case study explores the influence of pre-existing artificial fractures, while the second investigates the effects of deviatoric stress-induced microfracture development. Experimental results indicate that presence of fractures distinctly decreases wave velocities, with calculated dynamic elastic moduli decreasing by up to 7.5% in artificially fractured sandstone. Fracturing also tends to amplify the stress dependence of wave attenuation and the filtering of high-frequency wave components. Results also show a divergence of shear wave velocities polarized at 90° due to the development of microfracturing well before shear failure under deviatoric loading. This behavior occurs simultaneously with decreases in shear wave velocity and increasing stiffness nonlinearity, and is consistently aligned with the onset of rock dilatancy. Our study highlights the potential for full waveform analysis in sonic wellbore logging for in-situ fracture diagnostics, and the utilization of shear wave anisotropy to characterize rock damage. Introduction Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs provides new avenues for energy production in the US, accounting for 78.2 Bbls of crude oil, and 949.3 Tcf of natural gas. This equates to roughly 30% and 41% of the technically recoverable oil and gas in the US respectively [1]. Although unconventional formations have become increasingly important for the oil and gas industry, the need for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing force narrow profit margins, and low oil prices further decrease their financial feasibility. Core samples from unconventional plays exhibit minimal matrix permeability, however mudrocks are often laden with natural fractures on many scales [2]. Natural fractures not only act as planes of weakness for rock failure, facilitating the branching of hydraulic fractures, but they are also preferential conduits for the flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore [3]. Because evidence links natural fractures in tight reservoirs to increased production during hydraulic fracturing, gaining insight into the density and spatial distribution of natural fractures prior to hydraulic fracturing is vital for optimizing hydraulic stimulation efforts and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery [4]. Several methods have been developed for detecting, imaging, and characterizing natural fracture patterns and their relative abundance. Specifically, analysis of rock outcrops, core samples, well imaging and testing (DFIT/LOT), and microseismic data are among the most common, and most useful techniques for estimating the spatial distribution and density of natural fractures in the subsurface [5, 6]. Although each technique provides valuable information, their inherent limitations leave large technological gaps in our ability to utilize natural fractures to guide enhanced stimulation. Tool resolution, sample scale, depth of investigation, and sample disturbance are some limitations to in-situ characterization of natural fractures on micro scales and beyond the wellbore [7, 8, 9].

                    "abstract": "Abstract: Reservoir depletion results in changes in effective stresses, which may lead to significant changes in reservoir permeability. These changes are associated with matrix compaction, fracture closure and potential slip. A depletion-induced increase in effective stresses often leads to a decrease in permeability. However, the opposite is observed to happen in some fractured gas reservoirs with an organic rock matrix that exhibits strong sorption-mechanical coupling. During depletion, an adsorbed portion of the gas desorbs from micropores resulting in shrinkage of the organic components in the rock matrix, effective stress relaxation and a potential increase in fracture permeability.

The results of the study highlight the interplay between mechanical moduli, swelling isotherm parameters, and fracture compressibility in determining the impact of desorption on fracture permeability evolution during depletion. Introduction Natural gas consumption currently constitutes a fifth of the total energy sources [1]. About a half of nonassociated gas accrues to non-conventional gas reservoirs, mainly organic shales and coal seams [1]. Non-conventional tight reservoirs have an extremely low permeability, a fair portion of which pertains to fractures as main fluid conduits. The openings of these fractures are dictated by lithology and the reservoir stresses, which may alter during reservoir development [2-5]. Two competitive geomechanical processes are known to affect stresses during depletion in organic-rich rocks: pressure drawdown and desorption-induced shrinkage. The latter is of significant importance in coals because sorbed gas constitutes more than 50% of total gas in place and desorption induces a substantial amount of rock shrinkage [6-8]. Sorbed gas in hydrocarbon-bearing shales constitutes 5-15% of the total gas in place. Sorption capacity is usually proportional to total organic carbon (TOC) in shales [9]. Decreases in pore pressure associated with reservoir depletion cause increases in effective stresses, which often leads to fracture closure and a decrease in permeability. In contrast, desorption and matrix shrinkage result in a drop in effective stresses and an increase in permeability [8, 10, 11]. "

Whenever coal cores cannot be recovered to be studied in the laboratory, reconstituted coal samples from crushed granular coal can help estimate the coal matrix transport and adsorptive-mechanical properties. In fact, the use of crushed granular coal is advantageous to measure coal adsorption isotherms quickly. Yet, reconstituted coal specimens have an intergranular porosity system and a mechanical behavior that significantly differ from the in-situ coal seam. We apply a double porosity poromechanical model that captures the influence of the coal matrix adsorptive-mechanical properties on the overall response of reconstituted granular coal specimens. Two laboratory examples provide evidence for (1) adsorption-induced swelling stress during constrained CO2 adsorption and (2) desorption upon mechanical loading at constant CO2 pressure. Results show that the magnitude of adsorption-mechanical couplings in reconstituted granular coal specimens is extremely sensitive to the compaction of the granular specimen. High initial compaction, high effective stress during testing, and relatively low fluid pressure facilitate identifying the impact of the coal matrix adsorption and swelling on the overall specimen response. Yet, creep and elastic nonlinearities may hinder sorption-induced strains and stresses. Well designed experiments and application of a double porosity model are critical to obtain a robust interpretation and understanding of the adsorptive-mechanical properties of reconstituted granular coal.

Autoclave experiments are easier to perform and control but result in a limited ⿿skin depth⿿ of chemically-altered zone near the surface of the sample. This article presents the validation of micro-indentation and micro-scratch tests as efficient tools to assess the alteration of mechanical properties of rocks geochemically altered by CO2⿿water mixtures.

Decreases of measured parameters vary from 14% to 87%. Experimental results and analyses show that micromechanical tests are potentially quick and reliable tools to determine the change of mechanical properties of rocks subject to exposure to CO2-acidified water, particularly in well-controlled autoclave experiments.

We show the results of X-ray microtomography on coal cores with natural and induced fractures accompanied by digital image analyses for fracture discretization and numerical simulation of compressible fluid flow from an adsorptive medium to discrete fractures. Reconstructed tomographic images provide evidence of a complex network of open and mineralized fractures that interacts with induced shear fractures. Mineralized veins occupy from zero to up to 6% volume fraction in some bedding layers. Open fracture porosity is generally lower than 1% except upon shear and dilation. Natural fracture patterns can drastically change in less than 1 cm in direction perpendicular to bedding indicating strong lamination. X-ray microscopy can help assess brittleness during failure, the role of preexistent fracture tips on induced fractures, and potential for fines production. Digital image analysis based on the Hough transform yields meaningful results locating and characterizing a large number of fractures automatically along the core.

                    "abstract": "Unmineable coal seams constitute important domestic sources of natural gas in several countries. Although limited in size, coal seams have the advantage of being naturally fractured, which facilitates drainage upon depletion. Reservoir depletion changes the state of stresses in the reservoir. The change of stress is suggested by order-of-magnitude increases of permeability upon depletion and observation of significant fines production in some mature wells, this latter phenomenon known as \"coal failure\". Desorption-induced shrinkage of coal appears to cause changes of stress in the formation in addition to those of porepressure reduction during depletion. We summarize laboratory data replicating the stress path of coal seams far from the wellbore considering no change of horizontal strain and constant total vertical stress. Experimental results show that desorption-induced shrinkage promotes significant lateral stress relaxation sometimes leading to shear failure. Desorption amplifies the effect of pore pressure reduction and makes shear fracture reactivation more likely to happen than in non-sorbing rocks. This study shows the importance of considering depletion in coal seams as a chemo-geomechanical coupled process and the importance of rock failure in bulk reservoir permeability. 1. INTRODUCTION It has been long known that depletion of water- and hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs can change the state of stresses in the subsurface. Changes in stress can affect both the reservoir and surrounding formations [1-2]. Pore pressure reduction associated with depletion commonly causes an increase of effective stress in the reservoir rock such that the reservoir rock suffers a process of compaction. This change of stresses in the reservoir is usually anisotropic. Effective vertical stress is expected to increase more rapidly than horizontal vertical stress in horizontally extensive reservoirs. Such anisotropic changes in stress can cause shear failure in the reservoir rock. These changes are commonly measured as a reduction of total horizontal stress as documented in fields in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico [3-5]. Significant changes of effective stresses upon depletion are also expected in the vicinity of the wellbore and perforations. Localized failure in these areas coupled with high flow rates leads to production of fines, a phenomenon known as sand production [6-7]. Coal seams are naturally fractured gas reservoirs [8-9]. They are usually laterally extensive with modest net thickness. For example, the net thickness of the Fruitland Formation in San Juan Basin varies from less than 1 m to ~20m [10]. "

                    "abstract": "The recovery of natural gas from coal bed seams is usually accompanied by a significant increase of permeability induced by coal matrix shrinkage and stress relaxation upon gas desorption. This advantageous increase in permeability may be impaired sometimes by mechanical failure of the reservoir rock and ensuing production of coal fines. Near-wellbore stress concentration and reduction of lateral stresses are known to promote shear failure during depletion in oil and gas reservoir formations. Yet, conventional analyses have shown limited success in predicting coal failure, since other chemo-physical mechanisms may be responsible in enhancing the conditions towards mechanical failure in the coal bed reservoir rock. We show a set of triaxial experiments involving gas desorption from coal cores under zero-lateral strain condition (radial stress measured and controlled) and constant total vertical stress meant to simulate the stress path during production far from the wellbore. CO2 is used as surrogate fluid for CH4. The experimental data indicates that desorption can significantly help reduce lateral stress (and increasing deviatoric stress) until shear failure occurs. The results suggest that depletion-induced shear failure is much more likely to occur in coal seams than in conventional non-sorbing reservoir rocks. The adsorptive-mechanical coupling turns out to be a key phenomenon in the process. Numerical simulations at the representative elementary volume scale adopting a double-porosity poromechanical model support the experimental findings and permit calculating a critical gas pressure for shear failure to happen. This emergent phenomenon is comparable to the outcome of other situations such as mineral dissolution or thermal contraction, where shrinkage relaxes lateral stress and acts as an intensifying driver for promoting shear failure within the reservoir rock. Coupled numerical simulation is needed to include near-wellbore effects and validate our findings with actual field observations. A thorough understanding of the coupled response of coal seams is necessary to enhance reservoir management and mitigate the effects of coal failure on fines production. "

Models used in industry practice are based on swelling strains measured in “free” swelling coal or on empirical correlations between strain and adsorption, and predict permeability changes based on changes of porosity or stress calculated assuming an analogy with thermoelasticity. However, not only coal seams are subjected to in-situ stresses and geometrical boundary conditions but also sorption and strain are strongly coupled. Representative experiments and a truly coupled model for coal seams are needed in challenging applications. We present a set of triaxial testing measurements on 38 mm diameter fractured sub-bituminous/bituminous coal cores exposed to CO2. Testing includes the measurement of fluid uptake, adsorption-induced strains and stresses, and the impact on simultaneously measured permeability. Noteworthy, we measured increases in effective stress of up to 29 MPa when injecting CO2 at 5 MPa and preventing the coal core to swell. The results are analyzed with a poromechanical model in which coal matrix microporosity and adsorption-induced phenomena are embedded into a fractured reservoir rock with transverse isotropic properties. The adsorptive–mechanical coupling in the coal matrix is integrated through an adsorption stress function and fractured coal permeability is estimated as a function of Terzaghi's effective stresses (parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane). The experimental results and model predictions help identify the characteristic response of coal microporosity and cleat macroporosity on the poromechanical response of coal cores, and suggest that order of magnitude changes of reservoir permeability observed in the field are linked to sorption-induced change on Terzaghi's effective horizontal stress under laterally constrained displacement condition. Together, the modeling and experimental characterization offer unprecedented insights into the mechanics of coal. "

Changes in electrical and capillary forces are expected when CO2 invades the water saturated pore space. Sedimentation experiments conducted to explore the response of kaolinite and montmorillonite to deionized water, brine, heptane, liquid CO2 and supercritical CO2 show that both montmorillonite and kaolinite aggregate when submerged in CO2 and the final porosity in CO2 is smaller than in brine. Differences in dielectric properties between CO2 and water, and ensuing implications on van der Waals attraction and double layer repulsion explain the observed phenomena. On the other hand, capillary effects induced by the water–CO2 interface are corroborated by clay–water paste desiccation experiments conducted using supercritical CO2: water dissolution into the surrounding CO2 causes suction and capillary contraction, the invasion of the CO2–water interface into the sediment, and the formation of desiccation cracks. Volume contraction and crack initiation are consistent with the sediment response within an effective stress framework. Altered electrical forces and emergent capillary forces lead to coupled chemo-hydro-mechanical phenomena in seal layers that could facilitate CO2 breakthrough and advection through high porosity caprocks; related phenomena are identified in the reservoir rock. Additional studies are needed to further assess coupled phenomena when the interparticle distance is a few monolayers of water. "

While previous studies have shown successful CH4–CO2 replacement in hydrates, the mechanical response of hydrate-bearing sediments during CO2 injection, CH4–CO2 replacement, and CH4 production needs to be adequately understood in order to avert production problems such as borehole instability, sand production, and buckling of the casing. We take advantage of the characteristics of elastic mechanical wave propagation in sediments to monitor CH4 hydrate-bearing sands before, during, and after CO2 injection. Results show that CH4–CO2 replacement occurs without a loss of stiffness in the granular medium. This implies that CO2-flooded sandy reservoirs can remain mechanically stable during and after CH4 gas production. On the other hand, dry CO2 dissolves hydrate, and continued sediment flushing with dry CO2 reduces the degree of hydrate saturation in the pore space, opens the pore throats, and weakens the granular skeleton. This phenomenon may cause a significant loss of strength near the injection points and regions subjected to high liquid CO2 flow rate. The results of complimentary analyses show a decrease in bulk stiffness as water is displaced by liquid CO2, a stiffening of the granular skeleton during hydrate formation at contacts (diffusion limited), and the implications of water solubility in liquid CO2.

The behavior of each particle is then considered representative of its cell. This limits the convergence rate to the first order.

It is shown that this modeling approach provides an alternative to finite-element and finite-volume methods for solving poroelastic and fracture-propagation problems. In this paper, we specifically investigate the interaction between an HF and natural fractures (NFs). The peridynamics model presented here allows us to simulate the propagation of multiple, nonplanar, interacting fractures and provides a novel approach to simulate the interaction between HFs and NFs. The model predictions in two dimensions have been validated by reproducing published experimental results where the interaction between an HF and an NF is controlled by the principal-stress contrast and the approach angle. A detailed parametric study involving poroelasticity and mechanical properties of the rock is performed to understand why an HF becomes arrested or crosses an NF. This analysis reveals that poroelasticity, resulting from high fracture-fluid leakoff, has a dominant influence on the interaction between an HF and an NF. In addition, the fracture toughness of the rock, the toughness of the NF, and the shear strength of the NF also affect the interaction between an HF and an NF. We also investigate the interaction of multiple completing fractures with NFs in two dimensions and demonstrate the applicability of the approach to simulate complex fracture networks on a field scale. Finally, the 3D interaction study elucidated that the height of the NF, the position of the NF, and the opening resistance of the NF all have a significant effect on the 3D interaction between an HF and an NF.

It is shown that the presence of bedding planes, layer interfaces and even smaller scale heterogeneities can lead to fracture turning, kinking or branching. The mechanisms that control these characteristic fracture propagation behaviors (“turning”, “kinking”, and “branching”) near the layer interface are explored in detail. In layered systems, the mechanical property contrast between layers, the dip angle, the stress contrast and the mechanical properties of the layer interface all play an important role in controlling the fracture trajectory.

                    "abstract": "Most hydraulic fracturing models assume that the rock is homogeneous at a pore scale. However, reservoirs are highly heterogeneous at all length scales. Pore scale heterogeneity is evident from thin sections and scanning electron microscopic images (SEM). Heterogeneity at larger length scales is evident from logs and cores. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale (pore and core scale) heterogeneities caused by varying mineral composition and the presence of pores and microfractures, on fracture propagation has been investigated. A model that solves the solid displacements and fluid pressures both inside and outside the fracture and allows for the creation and propagation of multiple fractures is presented. This peridynamics-based hydraulic fracturing model is used to model the growth of multiple, complex fractures in a heterogeneous rock. Thin section and SEM images of rocks are used to represent the geometry of the rock grains and the pores in several rock samples. Far-field stresses are then applied and a fluid induced fracture is propagated in the rock matrix. The results of the model reveal that the stress distribution and the fracture geometry can be quite complex at the micro-scale. Fracture branching and turning is induced by variations in elastic moduli and stress concentration at the grain scale. The microstructure of the fracture is, therefore, determined by the geometry and distribution of mineral grains, their mechanical properties, and the initial stress anisotropy due to the co-existence of different mineral grains. A similar effect is observed at the core scale where differences in the microstructure of the rock can result in stress concentration at layer boundaries. For example, we show that the presence of a brittle mineral like calcite in the rock matrix causes fractures to branch at the mineral interface. Multiple fractures are shown to open, some that may not be in hydraulic contact with each other. As the fracture propagation continues, only the least tortuous path remains open. All other branches are bypassed hydraulically and are eventually closed. This fracture complexity occurs despite macroscopic stress anisotropy. Several examples of fracture propagation in rocks that are heterogeneous at a pore scale are provided to show that such fracture complexity should be expected in most lithologies. These results clearly show that while we have traditionally represented fractures as planes perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress, the fracture surfaces may indeed be much more complex due to existence of different minerals grains with widely different mechanical properties. Cracks can form away from the crack tip along planes of weakness. These damage zones resulting from strains induced by fracture propagation may explain the creation of the stimulated reservoir volume (regions of enhanced permeability) around fractures in shale reservoirs.

First, an IGA code is validated against the analytic solution for a quarter five-spot pattern as well as a reference solution for a straight line source problem with pressure enforced at the corners of the domain. Next, the numerical efficiency of IGA is compared against a finite element method solution of single phase flow in a 2D representative reservoir containing a centralized \"S-shaped\" line source.

Spurious wave reflection has been a primary concern in developing a robust multiscale–multiresolution model. In the current work a power-law based nonlocal peridynamic model has been proposed in order to mitigate this issue in a versatile manner. The fractional power-law eliminates the spurious wave reflection at the interfaces between local/nonlocal regions or regions with different nonlocalities. By controlling the exponent of the power-law it is possible to vary the frequency components of short or long waves without requiring a large handshake region. Using this underlying idea, 1|x−x′|1+α,∀0<α<2 can be used as a kernel function in order to define nonlocal interaction between x and x′. It was shown that by controlling α it is possible to change the nature of nonlocal interaction within any given cutoff range. Besides power law, Gaussian kernel is another good choice in minimizing the wave reflection issue. However, Gaussian function has some limitations with large variation in nonlocality or waves with higher frequency. In that context the proposed model demonstrated its effectiveness by removing any spurious wave reflections originated in various cases. "

Peridynamic equation of motion is known as upscaled Newton’s equation. The peridynamic system consists of finite number of nonlocally interacting particles at nano and meso scales. This particle representation of peridynamics can be treated in terms of classical statistical mechanics. Hence, in this work the phase space is constructed based on the PD particle from their evolving momentum pi and positions xi. The statistical ensembles are derived by defining appropriate partition functions. The algorithms for NVE and NPH implemented in the classical molecular dynamics are revisited for equilibrium peridynamic models. The current work introduces Langevin dynamics to the peridynamic theory through fluctuation–dissipation principle. This introduces a heat bath to the peridynamic system which eliminates the ambiguity with the role of temperature in a peridynamic system. Finally, it was seen that the homogenization of a peridynamic model with finite number of particles approaches to a conventional continuum model. The upscaled non-equilibrium peridynamics has potential applications in modeling wide variety of multiscale–multiphysics problems from nano to macro scale or vice versa. "

It is known that as temperature increases ripples originate in the flat landscape of a graphene sheet which is responsible for changing its properties. Among a limited number of works available in literature the role of length scales and temperature on the characteristics of the ripples has been investigated. However it is important to include the boundary conditions with other parameters in order to get a broader picture. In this work graphenes with three different sizes (2 nm, 10 nm and 50 nm) were considered under both simply supported and free-opposite-sides boundary conditions at different temperatures (e.g. 10 K, 100 K and 500 K) using molecular dynamics simulations. The variation in natural frequencies and their dependency on the boundary condition, length scale and temperature was thoroughly studied. Change in the boundary condition can introduce new modes of vibrations in graphenes. A combined effect of length scale, boundary condition and temperature was shown to be responsible for developing the geometrical patterns in the ripples. With free-opposite-sides boundary conditions the ripples are more harmonic in larger graphene than other cases. It was also noticed that the probability distribution for the off-plane displacements of the carbon atoms in graphene is typically non-stationary at small length scales. Variation in boundary conditions and length scales may affect the kurtosis of the distribution. The results showed adequate agreement with available data in the literature. "

                    "abstract": "A novel hydraulic fracturing model based on a nonlocal continuum theory of peridynamics is developed to simulate propagation of multiple non-planar fractures in an arbitrary heterogeneous medium. In this model, poroelastic behavior outside the fracture is also taken into account by coupling a peridynamics porous flow formulation with the peridynamics mechanics model. The fluid flow in the fractured region is modeled by an additional porous flow equation with material permeability dependent on fracture width defined in terms of local dilatation. (Application/Development) The model is applied to investigate the propagation of a hydraulic fracture (HF) in a naturally fractured rock. We investigate the role of poroelasticity, mechanical properties of the rock, the natural fracture and the fluid properties on the interaction between the HF and the natural fracture. It is shown that this fully coupled geomechanics and porous flow peridynamics model can be applied to understand the complex geometry and network of non-planar, multi-stranded and competing fractures. (Results/Conclusions) The poroelastic peridynamics model is validated by simulating the classical one dimensional consolidation of fluid saturated rock. The model results are compared with published experimental results. Simulated results show excellent agreement with experimental results, where the interaction between HF and natural fracture are controlled by the principal stress contrast and the approach angle. We then apply the model to outcrops and demonstrate the applicability of the approach to the generation of fracture networks on a field scale. (Significance of Subject) Several hydraulic fracturing models have been developed with varying degree of complexity, however, the models based on classical theory and linear elastic fracture mechanics remain limited in their ability to simulate the formation of non-planar, complex fracture networks. The peridynamics model presented here overcomes most of the limitations of existing models and provides a novel approach to simulate and understand the interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures.

The generalized scheme was implemented to a complex heterogeneous polymer: ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Using extended PFHMM, the atomistic model of UHMWPE was linked with the coarser peridynamic (PD) representative unitcells. Different phases (e.g. highly oriented unidirectional, amorphous or semicrystalline) of UHMWPE were blended during upscaling of polyethylene (PE) microfibrils. In literature, a thorough theoretical investigation on the deformation mechanism of highly oriented UHMWPE microfibrils is not available. So the current work also rigorously discussed the role of different loading conditions (such as torsion, tension and compression), pre-existing damages and aspect ratios on the stiffness as well as the strength of the UHMWPE microfibrils by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Through MD simulation, the effect of complex-loading condition on the strength reduction was also investigated. Cauchy–Born rule was applied through extended PFHMM in order to link the deformation from atomistic scale models with the macroscale UHMWPE representative unitcells. Finally, a slightly modified AIREBO potential was used to show that the unidirectional UHMWPE is independent of strain rate. The results had reasonable agreement with the experimental results. The current work can be considered to be a building block for multiscale modeling of complex heterogeneous materials. "

Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted on large Gn–PE systems. Different spatial arrangements of graphene sheets were considered in order to study the effect of nonlocal interaction among the graphenes. In all the cases 5% weight concentration of graphene was considered in order to prepare atomistic models for Gn–PE. As expected, graphene seemed to enhance the overall Young’s modulus and tensile strength of the Gn–PE nanocomposite. Randomly oriented graphenes with strong nonlocal interaction were observed to be comparatively preferable than the other spatial arrangements of graphenes. The high strength and stiffness of graphene sheets can be properly utilized if the graphenes are randomly oriented and have strong long range interactions. Finally, the failure mechanism of the graphene and role of voids in the polymer were discussed both qualitatively and quantitatively. It was seen that the randomly oriented graphenes were firstly pulled out from the polyethylene matrix during deformation prior to breaking into pieces. This can explain the loss of stiffness and strength in graphene sheets embedded in the polymer matrix. From the current work it is clearly understood that the necessity of the long range graphene–graphene interaction is important in both elastic as well as plastic regime of the deformation. "

The governing integral equations of the peridynamic formulation are computationally easier to solve in domains with discontinuities than the traditional conservation models containing spatial derivatives. A bond-based peridynamic formulation is also developed and demonstrated to be a special case of the state-based formulation. The non-local model does not assume continuity in the field variables, satisfies mass conservation over an arbitrary bounded body and approaches the corresponding local model as the non-local region goes to zero. The exact solution of the local model closely matches the non-local model for a classical two-dimensional flow problem with fluid sources and sinks and for both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model is shown to capture arbitrary flow discontinuities/heterogeneities without any fundamental changes to the model and with small incremental computational costs. "

In particular, we modified the conventional Hopkinson bar apparatus to produce relatively long duration pulses. The modified apparatus consists of a steel striker bar, annealed copper pulse shapers, an aluminum incident bar, and a tungsten disk with mounted accelerometers. With these modifications, we obtained accelerations pulses that reached amplitudes of 10 kG and durations of 0.5 ms.

The use of metallic materials in impact related applications requires the determination of dynamic crack initiation toughness for these materials. There are two main challenges in experiment design that must be overcome before valid dynamic data can be obtained. Dynamic equilibrium over the entire specimen needs to be approximately achieved to relate the crack tip loading state to the far-field loading conditions, and the loading rate at the crack tip should be maintained near constant during an experiment to delineate rate effects on the values of dynamic crack initiation toughness. A recently developed experimental technique for determining dynamic crack initiation toughness of brittle materials has been adapted to measure the dynamic crack initiation toughness of high-strength steel alloys. A Kolsky pressure bar is used to apply the dynamic loading. A pulse shaper is used to achieve constant loading rate at the crack tip and dynamic equilibrium across the specimen. A four-point bending configuration is used at the gage section of the setup. Results are presented which show a monotonically increasing rate dependence of crack initiation toughness for 4340 high-strength steel. "

                    "abstract": "Leak-off tests (LOTs) are performed to determine the strength of a newly drilled formation below a cased interval and to characterize the upper bound of mud weight that can be safely used while drilling the next section, without risk of formation breakdown and lost circulation. In an LOT, drilling mud is pumped into the wellbore, causing the wellbore pressure to increase and exceed the formation pore pressure. During the initial LOT build up, excess pressure in the wellbore causes the surrounding rock to deform and mud filtrate to invade into the formation via porous flow. In this paper, change in formation resistivity around a wellbore during initial LOT build-up has been investigated. Invasion is modeled assuming two-phase radial Darcy flow and deformation using a 3D finite element model. Invasion may result in an exchange of conductive ions between water-based drilling mud and formation water both by diffusion in the direction favored by the concentration gradient of the ions and by convective transport. This process is incorporated into the model by solving the radial convection-diffusion equation for the aqueous phase using a finite difference method. Archie's law is used to determine the formation resistivity. Findings show that the direct effect of deformation on porosity, therefore on formation resistivity during an LOT, is negligibly small even when the formation rock is highly compressible with compressibility in the order of 10−3 psi−1. While salinity solely controls formation resistivity during an LOT conducted in a fully water-saturated interval, water saturation change and salinity change compete to produce a compound effect on formation resistivity of an oil-bearing zone where water saturation varies dynamically due to displacement of formation fluids. Unlike compressibility, the effect of permeability on formation resistivity response is found to be evident and readily observable. While analyzing the formation resistivity responses at various depths of investigation (DOIs), it is found that the effect of DOI on resistivity response can be useful in studying invasion and assessing formation damage during an LOT. In addition to this, through comparing time-lapse resistivity logs at multiple DOIs during an LOT with numerically synthesized resistivity responses, the model promises a novel approach towards determining the permeability of a freshly drilled and unaltered interval.

According to this theory, the fluid and solid temperatures reach an equilibrium temperature value rapidly. However, in porous media, the rate of heat transfer between the fluid and solid may not be fast enough to achieve a local thermal equilibrium (LTE) due to their thermal diffusion properties. Therefore, this paper examines the importance of local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) in porous media with conductive heat transfer. The LTNE is constituted by energy equations and defines distinctive temperature profiles for both the solid and fluid phases. The Laplace transform and Stehfest algorithm methods have been employed in formulating an exact solution. Using the weighted average method, a temperature for the porous media is defined. Subsequently, the model is applied to a cylindrical hole subjected to a uniform temperature in an infinite porous medium (rock formation). The exact solution and transient temperature profile are the advantages of this model compared to existing LTNE models. "

                    "abstract": "Real-time drilling optimization is a topic of significant interest because of its economic value, and its importance increases particularly during periods of low oil prices. This paper evaluates different optimization strategies and algorithms for real-time optimization of an objective function (function to be optimized) specific to drilling. The objective function optimized here is derived from a data-driven (or machine-learning) model with an unknown functional form. A data-driven model has been used to calculate the objective function [rate of penetration (ROP)] because it has been shown to be more efficient in ROP prediction relative to deterministic models (Hegde and Gray 2017). The data-driven ROP model is built using machine-learning algorithms; measured drilling parameters [weight on bit (WOB), revolutions per minute (rev/min), strength of rock, and flow rate] are used as inputs to predict the ROP. Real-time drilling optimization that is data-driven is challenging because of run-time constraints. This is perceived as a handicap for data-driven models because their functional form is unknown, making them more difficult to optimize. This paper evaluates algorithms depending on their ability to best maximize the objective (ROP) and their time effectiveness. Two simple yet robust algorithms, the eyeball method and the random-search method, are presented as plausible solutions to this problem. These methods are then compared with popular metaheuristic algorithms, evaluating the tradeoff between improvement in the objective (search for a global optimal) and the computational time of run. Using results from the simulations conducted in this paper, we concluded that data-driven models can be used for real-time drilling despite their computational constraints by choosing the right optimization algorithm. The best tradeoff in terms of ROP increase as well as computational efficiency evaluated in this paper is the simplex algorithm. The ROP was improved by 30% on average with a variance of 2.5% in the test set over 14 formations that were tested. "

It is a complex process controlled by several factors, including the mechanical failure of materials around the wellbore and the material erosion due to fluid flow. The coupling between these factors leads to considerable challenges in modeling and predicting sand production. This paper presents a finite element based approach for simulating the realistic sanding process, considering coupling between mechanical failure and hydrodynamic erosion of the rock. A well calibrated sand criterion proposed by Papamichos was implemented to model sand erosion. An adaptive meshing technique was used to track receding of the eroded surfaces and to progressively modify boundary conditions on new surfaces, which are important for capturing the realistic sanding process. Sand production in both open-hole and perforated-casing completions was simulated to illustrate capabilities of presented method. Numerical results show that sand production is controlled primarily by the plastic strain and flow velocity around the wellbore. Other parameters, including drawdown, in-situ stress, and perforation orientation, are shown to have considerable influence on sand production rate and are discussed in this paper. "

                    "abstract": "Drilling optimization can provide significant value to an oil and gas project, especially in a low-price environment. This is generally approached by optimizing the rate of penetration (ROP) of the well, which may not always be the best strategy. Two additional strategies (or models) can be used to optimize a well – torque on bit (TOB) response to reduce vibrations at the bit or mechanical specific energy (MSE) to reduce the energy used by the bit. This paper evaluates these three models for drilling optimization based on several criteria. Models for ROP, TOB and MSE are built using a data-driven approach with the random forests algorithm using drilling operational parameters such as weight-on-bit, flow-rate, rotary speed, and rock strength as inputs. The drilling models are optimized using a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm to compute the ideal drilling operational parameters for drilling ahead of the bit. Machine learning is used to develop these models since these models are coupled which enable calculation of interaction effects. Results show that optimizing the ROP model leads to a 28% improvement in ROP on average, however, this also increases the MSE and the TOB which is undesirable. Optimizing the MSE model results in a (smaller) increase of ROP (20%). This is accompanied by a decrease in MSE (by 15%) and decrease in TOB (by 7%) which may result in longer bit life and additional savings over time. Hypothesis testing has been used to ensure that all simulations conducted in this paper show statistically significant results. "

Plastic rock deformation, fluid seepage, and time-dependent mudcake buildup on the wellbore wall affect the near-wellbore stress state and, therefore, the breakout behavior. In this paper, a hydro-mechanical model was developed for breakout prediction taking into account these factors. Filtration tests were conducted to obtain time-dependent permeability and thickness of mudcake, and the experimental testing results were incorporated to embody the dynamic mudcake buildup process. A sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the effects of horizontal stress anisotropy, drilling mud pressure, and time-dependent fluid flow and mudcake buildup on breakouts in a vertical borehole. The simulation results show increased possibility of breakouts with larger horizontal stress anisotropy. Additionally, fluid seepage between the wellbore and the surrounding formation makes the breakout a time-dependent process. For low mud pressure, the initial breakout shape immediately after drilling is very similar to the final breakout shape after reaching steady state seepage. However, for high mud pressure, the wellbore may experience significant breakout propagation after drilling, owing to considerable fluid seepage associated with the larger differential pressure between the wellbore and the formation. Time-dependent mudcake buildup on the wellbore wall can effectively reduce the likelihood of borehole breakout by acting as a low-permeability barrier that mitigates fluid seepage across the wellbore wall and reduces changes in formation pore pressure. Disregarding the mudcake or considering a perfectly impermeable mudcake can lead to overestimating or underestimating the risk of borehole breakout, respectively. The proposed model provides a useful approach to understand and assess borehole breakout for drilling design. "

                    "abstract": "For a stress-sensitive reservoir, the constant rock compressibility term used in a conventional reservoir simulator (CRS), does not account for change of porosity and permeability. This paper develops a coupled geomechanics and reservoir simulator (CGRS) which accounts for changes in porosity and permeability related to deformation. The simulator in this paper adopts a staggered grid finite difference method for fluid flow and displacements. Displacements and pore pressures are placed at centers of faces and grid blocks, which increases numerical accuracy. Four types of nonlinear, coupled equations (porosity, permeability, displacements, and pressure equations) have been derived for use in CGRS. The Newton-Raphson method requires solving all the unknowns simultaneously, a computationally intensive procedure. An alternative is to use the Macro Gauss-Seidel method, which divides a huge nonlinear matrix into several smaller matrices, thus speeding up computations. Solutions from CGRS have been validated using two analytical solutions: a one dimensional consolidated reservoir and an idealized reservoir. This validated simulator is used to simulate a 3D reservoir with multiple vertical and horizontal wells. The comparison between CRS and CGRS shows that pressure depletes faster in CRS as compared to CGRS. CGRS results in higher bottom-hole pressure for a constant rate well. Constant rate wells yield a result of 1 to 1.26 times higher bottom-hole pressure than CRS. This shows that neglecting geomechanics effects in CRS can lead to an under prediction of reservoir/bottom hole pressures and production rates. Another powerful function of CGRS is the output of 3D displacements, which cannot be predicted by CRS. After producing for 1000 days, the maximum vertical displacement reaches 0.34 ft. (0.085% of reservoir thickness). Maximum displacements in the x and y directions (lateral displacements) are 4 × 10-4 ft. and 0.015 ft., both of which are smaller than vertical displacement because of fixed lateral boundary conditions. Unlike traditional iterative coupled (IC) methods, fluid flow and geomechanics share the same mesh, which solves the problem of numerical instability in two discretization methods used in traditional IC. Also, the change of volumetric strain with respect to time (usually neglected in traditional IC) has been included in the fluid flow equation to better characterize the effects of solids movement on fluid flow. The Macro Gauss-Seidel method was adopted to increase computation efficiency of the simulations. The simulator introduced in this paper has its own data structure for geomechanics analysis which can be incorporated in single-phase, two-phase, three-phase or compositional reservoir simulators. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Borehole breakout is one of the major wellbore instability problems in both vertical and deviated wells. It usually presents a time-dependent failure process consisting of initiation, propagation, and stabilization stages. Most previous numerical modeling studies of this problem focused on vertical wells, whereas numerical simulation of breakouts for deviated wells is rare. In this paper, fully coupled hydro-mechanical models are developed using the finite element method for predicting borehole breakouts in both vertical and deviated wells. Effects of well inclination and fluid seepage from wellbore to formation during overbalance drilling are investigated. The simulation results show that the breakout direction of a deviated wellbore is not necessarily parallel to the direction of the minimum principal stress as compared to that of a vertical wellbore. After an exposure time with overbalanced drilling mud pressure, the wellbore can have a final breakout shape that is much larger than the initial one due to seepage induced stress changes around the wellbore. The proposed models provide a useful tool for understanding and predicting time-dependent wellbore breakouts for drilling practices. 1. INTRODUCTION Borehole breakouts are one of the major wellbore instability problems in both vertical and deviated wells. Field observations have shown that breakout is a phenomenon where falling rock spalls from the wellbore wall (Bell and Gough, 1979; Gough and Bell, 1982; Peska and Zoback, 1995; Zoback et al., 1985). Specifically, borehole breakouts are time-dependent failure processes, which consist of three stages: initiation, propagation, and stabilization (Cheatham, 1993; Moore et al., 2011; Olcott et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 1989). The breakout initiation is caused by stress concentrations around wellbores. The breakout propagation and stabilization are caused by fluid flow in near-wellbore formations (Cheatham, 1993). Borehole breakouts are normally time-consuming and expensive to fix in drilling operations. Therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive hydro-mechanical model for accurate prediction of time-dependent wellbore breakouts. "

The model couples dynamic mud circulation in the wellbore and induced-fracture propagation into the formation. It provides estimates of time-dependent wellbore pressure, fluid-loss rate, and fracture profile during drilling. Numerical examples were carried out to investigate the effects of several operational parameters on lost circulation. The results show that the viscous pressure losses in the wellbore annulus caused by dynamic circulation can lead to significant increases in wellbore pressure and fluid loss. The information provided by the model (e.g., dynamic circulation pressure, fracture width, and fluid-loss rate) is valuable for managing wellbore pressure and designing wellbore-strengthening operations.

                    "abstract": "Drilling in complex geological settings often possesses significant risk for unplanned events that could potentially impede already cost-demanding operations. Lost circulation, a major challenge in well construction, refers to the loss of drilling fluid into formation during drilling operations. When excessive wellbore pressure appears, lost circulation is induced by tensile failure or reopening of natural fractures at the wellbore. Over years of research efforts and field practices, wellbore strengthening techniques have been successfully applied in the field to mitigate lost circulation and have proved effective in extending the drilling margin to access undrillable formations. In fact, wellbore strengthening contributes additional resistance to fractures so that an equivalent circulating density higher than the estimated fracture gradient can be exerted on the wellbore. In this study, a fully coupled hydraulic fracture propagation model based on the cohesive zone model is presented. By implementing the model, an extensive parametric study is conducted to investigate factors involved in lost circulation. The parametric influences emphasizing the mass balance within the fracture reveal mechanisms of lost circulation mitigation. Simulation studies on wellbore strengthening are conducted in two parts, hoop stress enhancement and fracture resistance enhancement. First, a near-wellbore stress analysis characterizes wellbore mechanical responses during lost circulation. The results show elevated hoop stress during fracture width development, which validates the hypothesis of hoop stress enhancement. Also, beneficial influences from poroelastic effect and high rock stiffness are demonstrated. Then, a novel method to simulate fracture sealing is introduced to quantify fracture gradient extension for field practices. With this method, a case study on fracture sealing investigates the roles of sealing permeability and sealing length. The results show inhibition of fracture repropagation and conclude that fracture tip protection is achieved through fracture sealing and fracture fluid dissipation. From the case study, operational insights on wellbore strengthening design are derived. "

Modeling the depletion induced permeability alteration is crucial in forecasting hydrocarbon production and designing a drilling strategy. Porosity-based permeability models are typically used in which the permeability changes are assumed to be isotropic. However, most rocks are anisotropic, and the stress changes due to depletion and drilling a well are also anisotropic. As an example, we compared isotropic and anisotropic permeability predictions around a hypothetical well drilled in the Tor formation in Valhall field in the North Sea. The results show that isotropic permeability models tend to underestimate the degree of permeability reduction in the near-wellbore region, but even when anisotropy is considered, the permeability in the radial direction still only decreases by about 10%. These results may still need to be considered when designing a development strategy in depleted reservoirs. "

The 3D model is used to quantify the propagation pressure and the geometry of the debonding fracture in a vertical well. The effects of several key factors in the development of debonding fractures are investigated. The results show that fracture propagation pressure is more sensitive to horizontal stress than to casing pressure. The presence of initial defects at the interface can significantly reduce the propagation pressure and the debonding fracture tends to develop vertically, rather than circumferentially at the interface. The results also demonstrate that the debonding growth is highly influenced by the cement stiffness, critical strength and toughness of the interface, illustrating the importance of appropriate cement design. The method proposed herein presents a useful step towards prediction of loss of well integrity due to interface debonding, and provides improved guidance for cement selection and injection optimization.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Understanding near-wellbore hydraulic fracture complexity is important for the design of hydraulic fracturing. This paper presents a fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics model for predicting complex fracture propagation paths in the wellbore vicinity. The model is developed based on the coupled pore pressure extended finite-element method (XFEM). Fracture propagation, fracturing fluid flow, rock deformation, and pore fluid flow are coupled to model fracture behavior in the near-wellbore region. The influence of perforation angle and perforation length on near-wellbore fracture growth are investigated. Results show that a fracture initiated from a perforation misaligned with the direction perpendicular to the minimum field stress will finally reorient itself to that direction. But the fracture curvature resulting from fracture reorientation is highly related to the size and angle of the perforation. The results also demonstrate high dependence of fracture breakdown pressure on perforation size and location. The XFEM model proposed in this paper provides a unique tool to predict hydraulic fracture trajectory in the near-wellbore region. It can be used to aid design of various hydraulic fracturing related operations in the petroleum industry, such as fracturing stimulations, field injectivity tests, waterfloods, and produced water/cuttings re-injections. 1. INTRODUCTION Understanding the evolution of hydraulic fractures in the near-wellbore region is important for hydraulic fracturing design and injectivity test interpretation. The primary goal of hydraulic fracturing treatments is to provide a pathway, ideally with less tortuosity and high conductivity, to facilitate flow of hydrocarbons from the reservoir to the wellbore. The main objective of field injectivity tests, e.g. mini-frac tests and diagnostic fracture injection tests, is to quantify some key reservoir parameters such as fracture closure pressure, permeability, and pore pressure. However, near-wellbore fracture complexity may have adverse impacts on the effectiveness of hydraulic fracturing treatments and lead to difficulties in field test interpretations (Feng and Gray, 2017; Sepehri et al., 2015).

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Lost circulation, a major challenge in well construction, is the loss of drilling fluid into formation caused by wellbore hydraulic fracturing. Wellbore strengthening techniques can be applied to mitigate lost circulation by generating resistance to the growth of induced or natural fractures. In this paper, a fully coupled hydraulic fracture propagation model is presented to simulate lost circulation and wellbore strengthening. A near-wellbore stress analysis is performed to characterize wellbore mechanical responses during lost circulation. The analysis validates the hypothesis of hoop stress enhancement and emphasizes the impacts of poroelasticity involved in the stress enhancement. In addition, a novel approach integrating fracture resistance enhancement mechanism (i.e., tip protection) into hydraulic fracturing simulation is introduced and is used to quantify fracture gradient enhancement for drilling operations. Case studies are performed to assess different sealing conditions. Results show remarkable declines of fracture fluid pressure across the sealant and substantial reduction of fluid loss into the fracture. Case study concludes that fracture tip protection can be achieved through both fracture sealing and fracture fluid dissipation. Some operational insights on wellbore strengthening design are also extracted from this study. 1. INTRODUCTION Drilling operations require maintaining both hydrostatic and equivalent circulating density of drilling fluid within the mud weight window (MWW), which is bounded by a lower limit preventing fluid influx and wellbore instability and by an upper limit (i.e., fracture gradient) avoiding wellbore fracturing. A narrow MWW often arises in depleted formations where fluid production reduces the fracture gradient and when drilling extended-reach wells which possesses large wellbore pressure fluctuation. Lost circulation is a major problem in drilling with a narrow MWW. Under the circumstances, fluid loss disturbs the normal downhole condition, causing consequent chain reactions (e.g., underground blowout, unplanned casing point, etc.). Thus, nonproductive time has to be taken to remedy the wellbore and in turn leads to excessive expenses toward well construction. "

Three experimental methods were used to evaluate the hydrate inhibition performance of the synthesized copolymers: the capacity to inhibit the formation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrates (under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of −0.5 °C; i.e., a subcooling for THF hydrates of about 3.4 °C); the capacity to inhibit the formation of natural gas hydrates under high pressure (about 6 MPa) and low temperature conditions (about 1 °C; i.e. a subcooling of 16 °C for the studied natural gas sample); and the determination of the cloud point temperature of the studied copolymers in aqueous systems of varying salinity (under atmospheric pressure and temperatures ranging from 2 to 81 °C).

It is common engineering practice to optimize some controllable input parameters in a model to increase efficiency of operations. Machine Learning can be used to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) during drilling to a great accuracy as shown by Hegde, Wallace, and Gray (2015). This paper illustrates the use of machine learning to predict and increase ROP effectively. The machine learning model is first used to predict ROP – with input parameters such as weight on bit (WOB), rotations per minute of the drill bit (RPM), and flow rate of the drilling mud. The input parameters are then modified to increase ROP. This process has been applied to field drilling data from a vertical well consisting of different rocks and formations. The procedure can be used to determine the maximum achievable ROP in each formation, and map out operational guidelines for drilling of pad wells. A post drilling analysis can be conducted for pad wells to cut costs and save time while drilling. This model is very innovative because only surface measured parameters are used, without a priori requirements for geological, laboratory, or drilling data. "

New static filtration data were obtained using permeable filter discs manufactured from sand-cement mixtures to generate controlled formation material. The experimental results, consisting of fluid loss vs. time, mudcake porosity, and thickness at the end of the test, were used to evaluate the validity of the proposed methods and investigate the model's ability to predict the actual mudcake properties. Using the experimental results, some limitations of this model were identified. Therefore, modifications to Dewan and Chenevert's model were suggested to allow it to better capture the measured data, leading to the development of a new Wider Windows Filtration Model.

                    "abstract": "We investigate a novel hypothesis regarding the process of hydraulic fracture termination against a preexisting frictional interface. According to current understanding, crossing occurs when small tensile fractures form ahead of the crack tip, on the other side of the frictional interface, before the concentration of stress at the crack tip causes slip along the interface. Slip blunts the concentration of stress at the crack tip and causes termination. Existing crossing criteria assume that the incipient fractures ahead of the crack tip form instantaneously once the effective stress is sufficiently tensile. However, there is a poroelastic response that causes a reduction in pressure in response to opening. This is counteracted by flow into the crack from the surrounding matrix. In very low matrix permeability formations (shale, coalbed methane, etc.), flow of fluid inward from the matrix is slow, and the opening of these incipient fractures may require a non-negligible amount of time. Using the hydro-mechanical discrete fracture network simulator CFRAC, we performed a series of numerical simulations to qualitatively investigate this process. The simulations confirm that poroelastic response could affect incipient fracture initiation and hydraulic fracture crossing. Based on this mechanism, we developed a heuristic modification to an existing crossing criterion. We applied the new criterion to investigate an injection sequence for prevention of lost circulation in fractured, low matrix permeability formations. Lost circulation occurs if wellbore fluid pressure exceeds the minimum principal stress, causing fluid loss due to propagation of a hydraulic fracture. In our proposed injection sequence: (1) injection is performed at high rate to create near wellbore fracture network complexity and then (2) viscous fluid is injected into the newly formed fractures to create resistance to flow. The simulations show that this sequence may be able to mitigate lost circulation and create a stress cage around the wellbore. "

Rate of penetration (ROP) modeling is a key tool in optimizing drilling parameters, namely bit weight and rotary speed, for faster drilling processes. With a novel, all-automated data visualization and ROP modeling tool developed in Excel VBA, ROPPlotter, this work investigates model performance and the impact of rock strength on model coefficients of two different PDC bit ROP models: Hareland and Rampersad (1994) and Motahhari et al. (2010). These two PDC bit models are compared against a base case, general ROP relation developed by Bingham (1964) in three different sandstone formations in the vertical section of a Bakken shale horizontal well. For the first time, an attempt has been made to isolate the effect of varying rock strength on ROP model coefficients by investigating lithologies with otherwise similar drilling parameters. Additionally, a comprehensive discussion on the importance of selecting appropriate model coefficients bounds is conducted. Rock strength, accounted for in Hareland's and Motahhari's models but not in Bingham's, results in higher values of constant multiplier model coefficients for the former models, in addition to an increased RPM term exponent for Motahhari's model. Hareland and Rampersad's model is shown to perform best out of the three models with this particular dataset. The effectiveness and applicability of traditional ROP modeling is brought to question, as such models rely on a set of empirical coefficients that incorporate the effect of many drilling factors not accounted for in the model's formulation and are unique to a particular lithology.

                    "title": "Numerical Modeling of Borehole Breakout in Ductile Formation considering Fluid Seepage and Damage-Induced Permeability Change",
                    "abstract": "Abstract: Borehole breakouts, a series of complex processes that simultaneously affect the borehole wall, are characterized by initiation, propagation, and stabilization sequences. This paper presents a hydro-mechanical model incorporating plasticity strain softening by a Drucker-Prager-plastic yielding criteria and fluid seepage by Darcy's law in simulating breakout behavior. Damage-induced permeability change is also considered and modeled with a predefined relationship between the magnitude of plastic strain and permeability. A sensitivity study was performed using the proposed model to quantify the effects of in-situ stresses, mud pressure, and seepage time on breakout initiation and/or propagation. Results show that stress concentration induced initial breakout shape with low mud pressure is larger than that with high mud pressure. Fluid flow in the formation significantly affects breakout propagation and makes it a time-dependent process. For low mud pressures, the initial breakout shape without seepage is similar to the final breakout shape after seepage. For high mud pressure, the initial breakout shape is smaller than final breakout shape. The final breakout shape is also influenced by anisotropic in situ stresses and formation permeability. This proposed model provide a useful tool for evaluating the risk of wellbore breakout. Introduction A “borehole breakout” is a phenomenon in which portions of failing rock spalls from the wellbore wall due to high compressive stress around wellbore wall during or after drilling. Excessive breakout can lead to problematic wellbore stability and integrity issues, such as wellbore washout, wellbore collapse, and completion difficulties. Moreover, spalled cuttings resulting from borehole breakout are difficult to circulate out while drilling, which negatively affect drilling efficiency. On the other hand, field breakout events can be analyzed to obtain useful in-situ stress information. Breakouts are routinely used to determine the direction of horizontal stresses, and some authors have also suggested using it to constraint the magnitude of the maximum horizontal stress (Zheng, Kemeny, and Cook, 1989; Zoback et al., 1989; Dart, 1990; Ito, Zoback, and Peska, 2001). For a vertical well, Bell and Gough (1979) first observed that breakouts normally occur as a cross-sectional elongation in regions of high compressive stress (usually tangential stress around wellbore) and that they are parallel to the direction of the minimum horizontal stress (J. S. Bell, 1979). For a deviated well, stress concentrations around wellbore are influenced by well azimuth, well inclination, in situ stresses, rock properties, and drilling mud pressure (Li and Gray, 2015). The breakout of a deviated well also occurs at the region of maximum compressive stress but it is no longer parallel to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (Zhou, 1994). Generally, the initial shape of breakouts induced by stress concentration for hard and brittle rocks can be estimated by a linearly elastic model with idealistic assumptions that wellbore is circular and intact and rock properties are homogeneous for both vertical and deviated wellbores.

                    "abstract": "Abstract: With ongoing environmental concerns and increasingly stringent regulations, the traditional topic of wellbore integrity is more important than ever before. A great deal of importance is attached to the cement sheath because it is necessary to provide zonal isolation and well integrity during the life of a well. Debonding at the casing/cement or cement/formation interfaces, which may result in substantial flow channels and fluid leakage, is often responsible for the loss of wellbore integrity. A three-dimensional finite-element model is developed in this paper to simulate debonding fracture propagation at cement interfaces. Debonding is driven by pressure build-up at the casing shoe due to fluid leakage. The model can be used to quantify the length, width, and circumferential coverage of the debonding fracture. The simulation results show dependence of debonding fracture width and circumferential coverage on in-situ stress conditions, initial cracks around the casing shoe, and cement and formation properties. For example, with initial cracks in the cement interface, debonding fractures tend to develop vertically along the axis of a vertical well, rather than circumferentially around it. The method proposed herein presents a useful step towards prediction of well integrity and provides improved guidance for cement selection and completion optimization. Introduction Well integrity, always of importance, is becoming more so because of increasing environmental concerns and regulatory activities. Moreover, increasingly hostile environments such as HTHP fields, ultra-deep-water fields, and geothermal fields, along with more complicated development operations, such as those encountered in gas producing wells, gas storage wells, water injectors, and cuttings/waste injectors, all present new challenges for well integrity. Failure of well integrity can lead to costly remedial operations or total loss of the well, severe environment contamination, and even fatal accidents to operating personnel. The cement sheath is the heart of well integrity. It is expected to ensure well integrity by providing zonal isolation and support for the casing throughout the life of a well, from well construction, hydrocarbon production, to post-abandonment (Gray, et al., 2009; Feng, 2016). A successful cementing job is expected to result in complete zonal isolation, without leaving any leakage pathway in the annulus between casing and formation. Unfortunately, this goal is not always achieved, and failure of cement sheath commonly occurs during the life of a well (Fourmaintraux et al., 2005). "

                    "abstract": "Fracture-initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture-propagation pressure (FPP) are both important considerations for preventing and mitigating lost circulation. For significant fluid loss to occur, a fracture must initiate on an intact wellbore or reopen on a wellbore with pre-existing fractures, and then propagate into the farfield region. Wellbore-strengthening operations are designed to increase one or both of these two pressures to combat lost circulation. Currently, some theoretical models assume that FIPs and FPPs are only functions of in-situ stress and rock-mechanical properties. However, as demonstrated by numerous field and laboratory observations, they are also highly related to drilling-fluid properties and to interactions between the drilling fluid and formation rock. This paper discusses the mechanisms of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening, with an emphasis on factors that can affect FIP and FPP. These factors include microfractures on the wellbore wall, in-situ-stress anisotropy, pore pressure, fracture toughness, filter-cake development, fracture bridging/plugging, bridge location, fluid leakoff, rock permeability, pore size of rock, mud type, mud solid concentration, and critical capillary pressure. The conclusions of this paper include information seldom considered in lost-circulation studies, such as the effect of microfractures on FIP and the effect of capillary forces on FPP. Research results described in this paper may be useful for lost-circulation mitigation and wellbore-strengthening design, as well as hydraulic- fracturing design and leakoff-test (LOT) interpretation.

This technique artificially increases the wellbore's maximum sustainable pressure by bridging drilling induced or natural fractures with lost circulation material (LCM).

This paper presents a finite-element model to investigate the effects of these parameters on the evolution of near-wellbore hoop stress and fracture width in wellbore strengthening. Results show that the hoop stress around the wellbore and along the fracture can be substantially increased by bridging the fracture with LCM. A desirable LCM bridge should have low enough permeability to ensure there is no fluid flow across it. The best place to bridge the fracture, from the hoop-stress-engagement point of view, is the fracture mouth near wellbore wall. Fluid leak-off through the wellbore wall and fracture surfaces affects both hoop stress and fracture width distributions. Young's modulus has a significant influence on fracture width distribution, whereas Poisson's ratio has a very small influence. Finally, several useful field implications for wellbore strengthening are provided. "

Here, we propose a methodology that combines two different pore-scale models to better quantify formation damage. Further we validate the proposed model with core flood experiments. We first perform an experimental study of suspension flow into sintered glass bead plugs and measure changes in porosity and permeability. Specifically, glass bead suspensions of known mono- and poly- disperse combinations of particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs, while keeping the total invaded particle volume constant. The resulting changes in porosity and permeability are quantified using a CT scanner and pressure transducers, respectively. We then establish two different numerical models (each focusing on a different mechanism/length scale) to predict permeability reduction. The first model takes a pore-scale approach that models straining of larger particles through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from first principles. The detailed pore structure output from the first model is used as an input in the second model, which is a network model. This pore network model simulates permeability impairment caused by both large and small particles deposition in porous media. Forces exerted on small particles include hydraulic drag, gravity, buoyancy, electric double layer, and Van der Waals. Particle trajectories in a converging- diverging pore throat are calculated dynamically. We incorporate surface roughness and particle-surface interaction to determine particle detachment and attachment. Pore throat structure and hydraulic conductivities are updated dynamically to account for the effect of previously deposited particles. We finally compared the experimental results to simulation predictions and found that the combined pore- scale model is capable of predicting the porosity of the invaded core only in the deeper regions of the core.

The signatures of extended leak-off tests are very different between permeable formations (e.g. sandstones) and impermeable formations (e.g. shales). A proper understanding of this difference is important for test interpretation, particularly for the determination of minimum horizontal stress. Based on numerical simulation analyses, this paper contains a detailed comparison of extended leak-off tests in permeable and impermeable formations. The comparison results show that permeability and its related phenomenon such as fluid leak-off can significantly influence pressure versus time response of an extended leak-off test and lead to interpretation difficulties. Traditional interpretation methods using time development of bottom hole pressure cannot provide accurate estimate of minimum horizontal stress in impermeable formations due to the negligibly small leak-off through fracture faces to the surrounding formation. The numerical model developed in this paper provides a method for aiding interpretation and design of extended leak-off tests Introduction Knowledge of minimum horizontal stress (Shmin) is important in many aspects during the life of oilfield development. It impacts all the development phases from well design to well abandonment. Shmin is a key factor for design of well trajectory and casing programs, and prediction of wellbore stability and lost circulation in the drilling and completion phases (Feng et al., 2015; Feng and Gray, 2016a, 2016b; Raaen and Brudy, 2001). It is also one of the most critical elements for hydraulic fracturing design to maximize the recovery of unconventional reservoirs. In the production phase, Shmin is a required parameter for evaluation of sand production, reservoir compaction, and surface subsidence. For the well abandonment phase, knowledge of Shmin is needed to determine the abandonment plug setting depths to ensure the long-term integrity of the abandoned well. In addition, fluid injection operations, such as produced water injection, waterflooding, steam injection, cuttings reinjection and carbon dioxide injection, have become essential elements of field development worldwide. The long-term integrity of reservoir caprock has become a major safety concern surrounding these operations. Shmin is a key input for developing reliable, full-scale mechanical earth models and other analytical or empirical models for addressing this safety concern (Chan et al., 2015). "

An analysis of the aforementioned methods is carried out to evaluate computational efficiency of the processes. The statistical package R has been employed for processing and visualization of data and for displaying results. A comparison is made to real time ROP prediction carried out in previous work, to assess the relationship between predicted torque and ROP. A method is proposed to use classification techniques for predicting whether drilling is proceeding at the optimal level. Torque values were accurately predicted with all three methods discussed in this paper. However, scalability of the methods must be considered, owing to the increased computational efficiency that is required. Computationally efficient and robust systems are of high priority for field applicability. To that end, ensemble techniques were analyzed along with the aforementioned methods and runtimes were evaluated for all of the methods employed. Results show that this method can be incorporated into real time drilling situations, with attending low runtimes. Development of more accurate methods will require additional computational power and the use of ensemble techniques. Classification proves to be a good technique whenever optimization is required, as indicated by real time predictions. Classification techniques illustrated in this paper explore the viability of various options for correcting undesirable drilling performance. This paper presents state of the art statistical learning techniques for predicting torque and drag during drilling. Previous torque and drag calculations using finite element models provide a good cross reference with this statistical model for indicating operational anomalies. Unexpected values of torque may forecast imminent drilling problems. These methods can be utilized for prediction of drilling problems and proactive methods for avoiding them, and applied in optimized drilling procedures. "

                    "abstract": "Reservoir depletion alters formation pressure, far-field in-situ stresses, and stresses around the wellbore. All of these factors influence collapse and fracture gradients, and therefore the drilling mud weight window. For deviated wells in depleted reservoirs, this situation is even more complicated due to the effect of well inclination and azimuth on the mud weight window. Analytical model results are presented in this paper for mud weight window calculations, considering formation pressure depletion, initial in-situ stress ratio (SHmax/Shmin), well inclination and azimuth. In-situ stresses change due to reservoir depletion are first determined from poroelastic theory, assuming the reservoir experiences vertical deformation, but no deformation in the lateral directions. Next, far-field in-situ stresses after depletion are transformed to a deviated wellbore with arbitrary well inclination and azimuth. Then, utilizing the Mohr-Coulomb shear failure criterion and tensile strength failure criterion, collapse and fracture gradients are calculated for various ratios of initial horizontal stress, degree of depletion, wellbore inclination, and azimuth. Finally, the sensitivities of collapse and fracture gradients relative to these factors are compared and discussed. The most problematic situation is to drill highly deviated or horizontal wells in reservoirs with large depletion along the maximum horizontal stress direction. In this case, fracture gradient can reach extremely low levels, resulting in very narrow drilling window and very small margin for mud weight adjustment. Drilling along or near the direction of minimum horizontal stress is preferred. An interesting finding in this study is that fracture gradient does not always decrease for deviated wells, which is contrary to common understanding that fracture gradient always decreases as the pore pressure gradient declines.

                    "abstract": "Considerable efforts to model leak-off test (LOT) and leak-off behaviors have been carried out in the past. Altun presented a method to estimate leak-off volume by dividing the pressurized system into four sub-systems: mud compression, casing expansion, fluid leakage, and borehole expansion (Altun 2001). The volume response from each sub-system is then combined to represent the total volume pumped during a LOT. Most existing leak-off models do not account for mechanical behavior of cement and rock formations around the wellbore. While their compressibilities are small, the cement and rock formation volume changes can be significant. In this study, a mechanical expansion model has been developed, based on a linearly elastic, concentric cylinder theory developed by Norris (Norris 2003). The model is an extension of Lame' equations for multi cocentric cylinders and assumes the horizontal stresses on the system's boundary are applied equally in all directions, i.e., the horizontal, far-field stresses around the system are isotropic. The resulting model simulates the compound radial displacements of casing, cement, and formation along the cased hole, based on pressures inside the wellbore and in the far-field stress region. The volume generated from concentric cylinder expansion is then combined with Altun's mud compression volume and fluid leakage volume to simulate the total volume pumped during a LOT. One use of the model is the estimation of minimum horizontal far field stress. Since the model consists of concentric cylinders, the pressure on the outside boundary can approximate the minimum horizontal far field stress, which in turn and related to overburden pressure. The pressure inside the most inner cylinder is calculated from known mud weight. With an initial estimation for the far field stress and iterative methods, the minimum horizontal stress can be estimated. The developed models were then applied to field LOT data from the Gulf of Mexico. The results show that leak-off volume along the cased hole should be analyzed as a compound expansion of casing, cement, and formation. Since horizontal far field stresses in the GOM are almost equal (low anisotropy) (Salehi and Nygaard 2012), the Wider Windows LOT model simulates leak-off volume, leak-off behaviors, and far field stress.

                    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new system to optimize rate of penetration (ROP) while drilling by applying statistical learning methods for ROP prediction and providing real-time performance increases and closed-loop control. This paper establishes the viability of such a method, and then goes on to present a framework for phased development and integration into drilling rig operations. By developing such a system, the authors hope to provide a tool to the oil industry which can improve drilling efficiency, reduce non-productive time (NPT), and lower the cost of drilling. The statistical model at the core of this system relies on complex machine learning techniques like random forests, neural networks and ensemble techniques to build a predictive performance model of the well from both real-time data and data from previously drilled offset wells. Each rock formation type is analyzed separately, allowing the model to anticipate ROP performance changes at formation boundaries. This model can then assess the controllable drilling parameters and determine whether there is an opportunity to increase ROP by adjusting these parameters to some other value. The necessary real-time drilling data can be accessed on the WITS/WITSML protocol, and a framework for reading these data into our model in real-time was developed. By using parameter selection techniques, parameters which are significant in predicting ROP were identified. Consequently, an advanced statistical model was developed to process the available data into ROP predictions in real-time, and estimate changes on surface controllable parameters such that the optimum ROP could be reached. A three-phase testing and integration path was developed for taking this tool from concept to completion. The first phase is to apply the statistical model to data from wells which have already been drilled and determine the amount of time which could have been saved by optimizing ROP. Then the second phase is to integrate the system with real-time data acquisition and provide a passive indicator of the current well's optimization level with a red-yellow-green traffic light style indicator. The final stage is to implement closed-loop control, allowing the model to run in a fully automated state. Throughout this implementation, it was shown that there was substantial potential for ROP improvement by following the suggestions of this statistical model. This concept is innovative as it relies only on data which can be measured in real-time on the rig floor, and does not require information about rock strength, formation drillability, or other downhole properties. This paper provides the path for integrating this new statistical drilling optimization model into drilling operations, and provides a blueprint to bring this concept from simulation to the field. "

                    "abstract": "Predicting rate of penetration (ROP) has always been of fundamental interest to the drilling industry. Early predictions can assist the engineer in changing parameters to reduce non-productive time (NPT) and achieve optimum ROP. This paper illustrates methods to predict the ROP in a computationally efficient manner using only data available at the surface. These methods can then be incorporated into real time drilling operations, first through a passive diagnostic tool, and then an integrated real-time control loop. In this work, statistical learning techniques such as trees, bagged trees, and random forests (RF) are used to predict ROP. Trees provide easy interpretability and hence are favored over other non-linear techniques. However, accuracy is imperative in this procedure. Accuracy can be increased by using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) or Random Forests. These techniques are applied, using the statistical software computing package R and its numerous libraries. Statistical learning techniques have been applied to a data set which had nine predictors. Applying trees to a data set yields great visualization of the data, but the lack of accuracy and can result in substantial overfitting. This shortcoming was rectified using bagging or RF methods to substantially increase accuracy. The results were promising in all cases and acceptable for real time predictions. Scalability is another concern for real time operations. Computational efficiency of the methods were evaluated, and the best method was based on a combination of computational efficiency and accuracy. Potential time savings which would result from applying the model in real-time optimizations and demonstration of the power of machine learning techniques are included in this paper. Future improvements will be incorporated in real-time prediction during drilling. State of the art statistical learning and machine learning techniques are applied to prediction of ROP, whereas previous prediction methods have not been based on real-time drilling data. The result is a computationally efficient model which can determine the right features for prediction at each step, while also incorporating engineering judgement and maintaining integrity of the statistical principles being employed. These methods can easily be extended to other drilling parameters such as MSE or Torque and Drag. "

                    "abstract": "Use of data analytics has become pervasive to optimize results and increase the efficiency of operations. Similarly data obtained during drilling can be used to predict rate of penetration (ROP) using statistical and machine learning techniques. However, one of the most basic forms of statistical analysis i.e. multivariate regression can be used for inference to improve the computational efficiency of more complicated models. Multivariate regression (MVR) has been applied to a field data set to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) based on features of the data. While MVR works as a predictor, its use as an inferential technique shows more promise. Regression techniques have been combined with bootstrapping techniques to analyze residuals when data set features are plotted against ROP. Analysis of these graphs provides insight into the non-linearity in the relationships among the data. Bootstrapping the residuals also yields a good predictor. The regression model has also been subjected to the bootstrap technique separately to observe its behavior on predictions. Using the aforementioned techniques, features with both linear and non-linear relationships with ROP can be identified. This saves computational power when in investigating real time applications of the data. Features having a linear relationship with ROP can be modeled with linear techniques and the rest using non-linear techniques. These concepts have been implemented in this paper using general additive models to yield excellent accuracy. More complicated models employ ensemble techniques which can be computationally robust and provide excellent accuracy. When ensemble techniques are used, identifying the data associated with each method can be crucial to efficiency of the technique. The data used in an ensemble technique for prediction illustrates the important role that this technique can play in reducing error as well as increasing computational efficiency. The model developed using linear techniques with bootstrapped residuals also gives a low error rate in prediction results. Using linear methods for determining the nature of relationships within the data is important in developing computationally robust models. Using this as an inferential technique can serve as a key component of data exploration in any operation. Moreover, these methods can be a stepping stone to improving the use of ensemble techniques in real time drilling operations. "

NPT events such as lost circulation, wellbore collapse, pressure control, underground cross-flow/blowout, and pipe sticking are more likely. Such problems greatly increase drilling costs. Plugging existing fractures or fractures induced during drilling with lost circulation materials (LCM) is often used to increase the drilling window. Various techniques have been used, but the several factors affecting these procedures, known as ‘wellbore strengthening’, are not thoroughly understood. Finite element models are used to evaluate wellbore and near-wellbore stresses during fractureb initiation and propagation, and after plugging fractures with LCM. Fracture behavior under different formation in-situ stresses, number of induced fractures, fracture geometry, rock permeability, and mud cake permeability are investigated. An Extended Finite Element enriched region is used to generate cracks when principal stresses are greater than the maximum defined in traction separation laws. Hoop stresses at the wellbore wall are greatest when the sealing location is close to the crack mouth. Along with the increase of formation horizontal stress anisotropy, both hoop stresses at the wellbore wall and the fracture width increase. Rock Young’s modulus has a minor influence on hoop stress distribution at the wellbore wall. Pore pressure facilitates fracture closure after bridging by decreasing hoop stresses at the wellbore wall. The crack locations are symmetric at the wellbore wall for a perfectly circular wellbore, but a rough wellbore (rugosity) can result in non-symmetric cracks. Cracks are not opened at the same time; one crack is opened and propagated sequentially after another one. This paper discusses wellbore strengthening factors, with the goal of better understanding of the several interacting events local to the wellbore and near-wellbore regions and improving operational considerations related to lost circulation events.

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of drilling mud below the bit and into the wellbore wall causes pressure gradients that significantly degrade drilling performance, wellbore stability and production. Due to heterogeneity, standard constitutive relationships and models yield poor predictions for flow (e.g. permeability) and rock properties (e.g. elastic moduli) of the invaded (damaged) formations. This severely reduces our ability to, for instance, estimate pressure build-up, optimize the mud cake properties or predict rock mechanical behavior. We propose a numerical model for permeability estimation in damaged formations near wellbore (e.g. sediments invaded by fines or sand crushing remnants). Grains of two length scales are present, but only larger ones are load-bearing. Detailed cemented granular packs were modeled using a discrete element method software, and ensuring mechanical stability. The particle positions and arrangement were available for subsequent pore throat network analysis. The standard network modeling approach for analysis of packing of nearly equal grains (Delaunay tessellation) cannot be used since grains of two different length scales create a high fraction of distorted pores. The main novelty of this work is adapting the network flow model to work with two length scales, and we present both the network creation and flow model in the multi-scale case. The effects of particle size and initial formation porosity on formation damage are studied in detail. Our study confirms that large particles tend to occupy the formation face, while small particles invade deep into the formation. Moreover, particles which are smaller than pore throats (entrances) impair permeability more than those larger than pore throats. Our study also indicates that a higher initial formation porosity leads to more particle invasion and permeability impairment. Thus in order to reduce formation damage, mud particle size distributions should be carefully selected according to given formation properties. "

These wells, often drilled from floating rigs, tend to present rapid departures from more normal conditions to very high degrees of overpressure, elevated temperatures and where formation pressures often approach fracture gradient. Further, once overpressure is geologically established in isolated pressure compartments, reservoir fluids tend to migrate vertically via hydro-fracturing to shallower depths.18 Challenges associated with cementing operations include actual leak-off test value (LOT) vs. predicted, margins of error in mud weights estimated, and risk of inducing a fracture during pre-flush and slurry displacement. If the open hole was under-reamed, the actual fracture pressure may be reduced by an unknown amount. ‘Wellbore strengthening' operations and associated procedures add additional formation fracture gradient uncertainty.4 This presentation speaks to applying the principals of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and recent refinements of its practice to cementing processes. Precise flow in/out measurements in real-time, ascertainment of actual downhole pressure environment, ability to conduct frequent dynamic formation integrity tests (FIT's) without drilling interruption and use of PLC choke systems are applicable strengths19,20,22.

Several methods used the latest mechanistic multiphase flow models in order to predict bottomhole circulation pressure when performing UBD/MPD operations. A new model is developed that utilizes the latest mechanistic multiphase flow models; the developed model calculates the bottomhole circulation pressure as a function of surface injection rates, choke pressure and time. The developed model can be used in designing and optimizing UBD/MPD operations in terms of determining the correct injection rate and/or choke pressure. In addition, the developed model is used to utilize the reservoir energy to attain correct bottomhole conditions. The developed model in addition to utilizing the latest mechanistic models also reduce the error in calculating the bottom hole pressure by incorporating an algorithm in which the injection rates are calculated in-situ rather than assuming constant injection rates. The model is validated against data from literature and against a commercial simulator. Results show that the developed algorithm has increased the accuracy in predicting bottomhole pressure by incorporating the changes in new gas and liquid injection rates. "

                    "abstract": "In this paper, a new method is proposed to theoretically quantify cation exchange capacity (CEC) of pure clay minerals, by use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis. A theoretical model is introduced to estimate CEC, which is derived based on energy balance between chemical potential and electric potential energy. The change in chemical potential is a function of relative humidity and volume of hydration water. The change in electric potential energy is a function of the CEC, basal spacing, and surface area of clay minerals. XRD measurements were performed on clay minerals before and after exposure to 95% relative humidity. These measurements were used to estimate the basal spacing before and after hydration as well as the number of interlayers in each particle of clay minerals. NMR laboratory measurements were performed on the clay mineral samples before and after hydration to obtain the volume of hydration water. The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms provided the surface area of clay minerals. The estimates of CEC from the new method were cross-validated against the directly-measured CEC, obtained from ammonium acetate method by use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements. The introduced method was successfully tested on six types of clay minerals (i.e., illite, kaolinite, chlorite, and three types of montmorillonite). The calculated CEC results from the new method were in agreement with those from the wet chemistry method, with less than 7 meq/100 g difference for all types of clay minerals. The experimental results on the performance of the new method demonstrated reliability of this method for quantification of CEC. The outcomes of this paper can be potentially applied to variety of formations with measurable concentrations of clay minerals such as shaly sands and organic-rich mudrocks for reliable assessment of CEC.

                    "abstract": "Proppant performance can significantly affect the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments and production in unconventional plays. Performance of proppants can decrease rapidly by mechanical damage. Quantifying the impact of mechanical damage on proppant performance can be challenging either in the laboratory or in-situ condition. This paper introduces a new method based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Transverse relaxation (T2) measurements to characterize pore-size distribution in proppant packs. Quantifying the pore-size distribution in proppant packs enables enhanced evaluation of porosity and conductivity of proppant packs and possible mechanical damage to the packs. The objectives of this paper are (a) to evaluate the performance of this new NMR-based method for characterizing pore structure of the proppant packs, and (b) to isolate and quantify the mechanical damage in proppant packs due to generating of fines in the laboratory using this new NMR-based method. First, we prepared proppant pack test samples in three categories including (a) different types of proppants with different surface relaxivity, (b) mixture of proppants with different sizes, and (c) proppants undergone different levels of mechanical damage. We measured NMR response in proppant packs and quantified the impacts of proppant type, size, and mechanical damage on NMR T2 distribution. Next, we used the fractional packing model to quantify the efficiency of packing of proppant mixture and to quantify the changes in porosity of proppant packs caused by variation in size and fraction of fines. Finally, we used Kozeny-Carman (KC) equation and modified Schlumberger Doll Research (SDR) equation to correlate the variation in T2 distribution to the decrease in proppant pack permeability. Results showed that NMR T2 distribution is sensitive to pore-size distribution in the proppant packs. The variable pore-size distribution was either a consequence of having a mixture of proppants with different sizes or different levels of mechanical damage. The impacts of fines on the pore-size distribution of the proppant packs was measureable, which is promising for the successful application of the introduced method for time-lapse quantification of generated fines. We also observed a measurable sensitivity of T2 distribution to mechanical damage in the proppant packs, which enables quantifying the level of damage in proppants through quantifying pore structure in the proppant packs. The NMR T2 measurements were, however, sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic materials such as iron in proppants. This sensitivity was more significant in cases where paramagnetic materials were distributed on the proppant surface. The proposed method is considered as an indirect measurement of pore structure and could potentially provide a quantitative assessment of the proppant pack conductivity both in the lab-scale and in-situ conditions. Improved assessment of proppant conductivity can help in enhancing the design and execution of fracture treatments for successful development of unconventional plays. "

                    "abstract": "Wettability of organic-rich mudrocks has significant impacts on multiphase fluid flow and hydrocarbon recovery. This important rock property has still not been well quantified in organic-rich mudrocks. Kerogen can constitute a significant fraction of mudrocks and can considerably affect their wettability. Recent publications suggested that kerogen wettability is affected by thermal maturity of rocks, and can influence wettability of mudrocks. In this paper, we experimentally (a) quantify the influence of chemical bonding on the wettability of kerogen, and (b) quantify the influence of geochemistry and kerogen wettability on the wettability of organic-rich mudrocks. We first isolated kerogen samples from different organic-rich mudrock formations and synthetically matured them. The variation in chemical bonding state of carbon present in kerogen at different levels of natural and synthetic thermal maturity was determined using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. We then quantified the wettability of pure kerogen samples at different thermal maturity levels using sessile drop method and determined the impact of aromatic carbon content on wettability of the kerogen samples. The wettability of organic-rich mudrock samples at different synthetic thermal maturity levels was then measured using sessile drop method, and also indirectly estimated using spontaneous imbibition experiments on crushed mudrock pack. We quantified the concentrations of minerals in the mudrock samples using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) at different synthetic maturity levels. We tested kerogen and mudrock samples from two organic-rich mudrock formations (named A and B) and demonstrated experimentally that the wettability of kerogen changes from water-wet to hydrocarbon-wet with increase in aromatic carbon content. The contact angle of water droplet on kerogen increased by 78° and 30° when the aromatic carbon concentration increased by 19% and 16% in formations A and B, respectively. We also quantified the wettability in mudrock core samples and showed that there was a 5° increase in contact angle with a 96% decrease in Hydrogen Index (HI) of organic matter in the mudrock samples. The water imbibition measurements in crushed mudrock samples suggest that the volume of water imbibed was higher by 22 ml at lower thermal maturity (i.e., HI of 328 mg HC/g organic carbon) as compared to mudrock samples at lower thermal maturity (i.e., HI of 10 mg HC/g organic carbon). The results indicate that the kerogen wettability could potentially impact the wettability of mudrocks and that the mudrock has higher water wettability at lower thermal maturity of kerogen. The outcomes of this papers can contribute to a better understanding of the effects of kerogen wettability and thermal maturity on mudrock wettability. The outcomes can also have contributions in understanding flow mechanisms in organic-rich mudrocks as well as in developing reliable rock physics models for interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements (e.g., electromagnetic and NMR measurements) in organic-rich mudrocks.

                    "abstract": "Two dimensional (2D) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements can enhance the quantification of petrophysical properties in organic-rich mudrocks. However, the interpretation of these measurements is still challenging as the mechanisms of proton surface relaxation in organic pores are not well understood. The objectives of this paper are to verify the existence of different coupling mechanisms using 2D NMR responses, to develop a new surface relaxivity model, and to apply the new model for simulation of NMR responses in organic-rich mudrocks. The first step includes extracting pure kerogen from different samples of organic-rich mudrocks. Then we perform transverse relaxation (72), longitudinal and transverse relaxation (T1-T2), and T2-T2 measurements on the extracted kerogen samples saturated with polar (water) and non-polar (decane) solvents. We use the results of NMR measurements to confirm the prevalence of both inter- and intra- molecular dipolar coupling in kerogen-fluid interactions. We develop a new relaxivity model by including the effects of the aforementioned coupling mechanisms, internal molecular motion, and surface averaging of relaxation time on kerogen surface relaxivity. The new surface relaxivity model is used to simulate NMR T2 measurements in a pedagogical ellipsoidal pore and in pore-scale images of organic-rich mudrocks using our previously developed three dimensional (3D) finite-volume numerical simulator. The results of NMR simulations are used to quantify the sensitivity of different coupling mechanisms on NMR T2 measurements and NMR-based estimates of adsorbed hydrocarbon volume. We performed NMR measurements on two kerogen samples at different thermal maturities, saturated with water and decane. T2 measurements in the kerogen samples reveal multiple peaks with dominant T2 values between 10-250 milliseconds for both decane and water. The dominant peak in T1-T2 measurements present T2/T2 ratios of up to 7 demonstrating the impact of intra-molecular dipolar coupling on surface relaxation in kerogen pores. The T1-T2 measurements yield up to 4 off-diagonal peaks indicating the influence of spin diffusion and inter-molecular dipolar coupling during surface relaxation in organic pores. The results of numerical simulations demonstrate that misidentifying the coupling mechanisms could cause a relative error of up to 80.6% and 24.2% in the estimation of adsorbed hydrocarbon volume in ellipsoidal pores and mudrock samples, respectively. The outcomes of this paper can potentially enhance the interpretation of NMR responses in organic-rich mudrocks by quantifying the influence different coupling mechanisms on kerogen surface relaxivity, NMR T2 measurements, and NMR-based assessment of adsorbed hydrocarbon volume. The developed surface relaxivity model is more reliable than the previously published relaxivity models as it includes the effects of both inter- and intra-molecular dipolar coupling on surface relaxation in organic pores. The new model can be extended for quantifying surface relaxivity at higher temperatures and fluid viscosities which enables interpretation of NMR logs in-situ condition. Enhanced quantification of surface relaxivity also enhances NMR-based reservoir characterization, and helps to improve estimates of hydrocarbon reserves in organic-rich mudrocks. "

                    "abstract": "Interpretation of electrical resistivity measurements for assessing hydrocarbon saturation in mixed-wet and hydrocarbon-wet rocks often requires extensive recalibrations of resistivity models. In these conventional resistivity models, the impact of wettability is not reliably incorporated. Recently, we analytically derived a new resistivity model that incorporates parameters to account for wettability and complexity of pore structure. This new model requires experimental verification to enhance its applicability in core- and logscale domains. The objectives of this paper include (i) to experimentally quantify the influence of wettability on electrical resistivity measurements, (ii) to improve and validate the analytically derived resistivity model in rocks with different levels of wettability at different water saturations, and (iii) to demonstrate the physical meaning of the parameters related to wettability in the new resistivity model. We first selected core samples covering a wide range of complexity in pore structure. We altered the wettability by injecting a surfactant solution into the cores using a core-flood setup. Some samples were also injected with decane and aged in decane to become mixed/hydrocarbon-wet. To measure the wettability of the samples, we used the combined USBM and Amott- Harvey method along with sessile drop contact angle measurements. Next, we used a centrifuge to vary the water saturation in the core samples. We then measured the electrical conductivity of each sample. Finally, we improved the recently introduced resistivity model and compared the estimates of resistivity index from the improved model against the experimentally measured resistivity indices. We successfully verified the reliability of the improved resistivity model for mixed-wet carbonate core samples. The surfactant injection altered the wettability in the range of -0.18 to 0.45 on the USBM wettability scale. We also demonstrated that all the coefficients required by the improved resistivity model are physically meaningful. One of the unique contributions of this paper is introducing a new interpretation diagram, called the wettability triangle. This diagram can potentially be used to quantify wettability from resistivity measurements, if combined with other geophysical measurements. The outcomes of this paper are promising for reliable interpretation of resistivity logs in mixed-wet formations with complex pore structure for improved assessment of hydrocarbon saturation with minimal calibration efforts.

                    "abstract": "Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) is commonly used to quantify electrical rock-fluid interfacial interactions and the influence of clay minerals on electrical conductivity of clay-rich rocks and clay-bound water. Quantification of CEC is, however, challenging. Conventional methods such as wet chemistry, multiple salinity, and membrane potential have limitations associated with their application in in-situ condition, certain type of formations, and use of empirical correlations. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we recently developed a new method for CEC assessment in pure clay minerals by integrating nitrogen adsorption-desorption, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. This method has yet to be developed for complex rock compositions. In this paper, we (a) introduce a new workflow for CEC evaluation in rocks with complex mineralogy and presence of multiple types of clay minerals and (b) cross-validate the effective CEC from the new method against the directly-measured CEC from the wet chemistry method. The introduced workflow for CEC estimation in rocks incorporates quantitative characterization of mineral composition as well as XRD measurement, nitrogen adsorption-desorption and NMR measurements. To test the workflow, we start with synthetic rock samples, which are manually mixed with different minerals with known compositions. We perform XRD measurements to obtain basal spacing variations. We perform successive controlled nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements as well as NMR measurements, and propose an inversion algorithm to estimate surface area of each mineral and volume of hydration water of each clay mineral in multiple samples, respectively. Then, we use these results as inputs for CEC estimation. Meanwhile, for actual rock samples, we start with quantitative XRD measurements to obtain the composition of different minerals and then quantify volume of hydration water, basal spacing variations, and surface area for CEC estimation. Finally, we cross-validate CEC estimation, both for synthetic rock samples and actual rock samples, with CEC estimates from the wet chemistry method by use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements. The proposed workflow is successfully tested on both synthetic and actual rock samples. The CEC estimates from the new method are in agreement with those from wet chemistry method, with less than 3 meq/100g difference for synthetic rock samples and with less than 4 meq/100g difference for actual rock samples, which includes three types of clay minerals. The experimental results demonstrate reliability of the introduced method for CEC quantification. The outcomes of this paper can be applied to variety of formations with complex lithology and can be considered as an onsite supplement application for mud logging. "

                    "abstract": "The interaction between the solid and fluid phases, characterized by the wettability of the formation, strongly affects the fluid distribution in the pore-space and consequently the conductivity and the polarization mechanisms of the rock. Resistivity models that incorporate rock wettability for improved assessment of hydrocarbon reserves have been recently developed. However, wettability and pore structure in such models still have to be determined from core measurements and imaging methods. Dielectric dispersion measurements can simultaneously provide information about different polarization mechanisms at different frequencies, which are affected by porosity, grain-size distribution, and wettability. Thus, a multi-frequency interpretation of dielectric measurements can provide information about volume of fluids as well as solid-fluid interfacial properties, such as wettability and cation exchange capacity. In this paper, we introduce a new mechanistic model to characterize multi-frequency dielectric measurements of mixed-wet formations. The objectives of this paper include (a) to quantify the influence of wettability on broadband dielectric dispersion mechanisms, and (b) to incorporate wettability and interfacial polarization at fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interfaces in a rock physics model for broadband characterization of dielectric measurements. All the parameters required by the introduced model are associated to physical mechanisms at microscopic- and pore-scale or geometrical features of the rock. The induced polarization at the electrolyte-solid interface is characterized by a mechanistic model of Stern and Gouy-Chapman layers honoring the electrochemical interactions occurring at the surface of grains and clays. We also introduce a model to characterize the electrolyte-hydrocarbon interface, which originates from the adsorption of hydroxyl ions. We integrate the aforementioned solid-fluid interfacial mechanisms with the bulk properties of fluids and grains through the sequential application of an effective medium model, making explicit the dependence on wettability. We successfully applied the introduced model to six sandstone core samples from two formations at different wettability conditions. The dielectric permittivity measured from 100 Hz to 1 GHz in the laboratory was in agreement with the permittivity obtained from the proposed analytical rock physics model model. The proposed model confirmed the experimental observations that the wettability has a detectable influence on dielectric permittivity. A significantly decrease in dielectric permittivity below 100 kHz was predicted by the model as the fraction of hydrocarbon-wet grains increases. The new model also explained the polarization experimentally observed around 1 MHz through the presence of a capacitive layer at the hydrocarbon-brine interface. The outcomes of this paper can enhance petrophysical interpretation of mixed-wet rocks by integrated interpretation of multifrequency dielectric dispersion measurements. "

                    "abstract": "Variable depositional cycles and severe diagenesis are among the main contributing factors to the complex pore network encountered in formations such as carbonates. This complexity is often not taken into account reliably in conventional models for permeability assessment. Conventional methods for permeability assessment, including electrical-based models (e.g., Katz and Thompson) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)-based models (e.g., Coates and Schlumberger-Doll-Research), either require pore-scale characterization of pore network or extensive calibration efforts such as detection of cutoff values and assessment of constant model parameters. Joint evaluation of dielectric permittivity, resistivity, and NMR measurements enables capturing pore-network connectivity, tortuosity, and throat-size distribution for real-time and reliable permeability evaluation, which significantly improves permeability assessment. Such joint interpretation enables taking into account pore structure in assessment of permeability. The objectives of this paper include (a) estimating parameters that quantify rock fabric features (e.g., tortuosity, effective pore size, throat-size distribution) by joint interpretation of electrical resistivity, dielectric permittivity, and NMR measurements, (b) developing a new workflow for permeability assessment that incorporates the quantified rock fabric parameters, and (c) validating the reliability of the new permeability model in core-scale domain using electrical resistivity, dielectric permittivity, NMR, Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP), and permeability measurements. To achieve the aforementioned objectives, we introduce a workflow to estimate rock fabric properties as inputs for permeability assessment. NMR measurements will be used to estimate the porosity and the effective pore size. Dielectric permittivity and resistivity measurements to estimate tortuosity constriction factor. Then, we calculate the pore-throat-size distribution from the estimated constriction factor and effective pore size. Finally, the aforementioned quantitative rock fabric parameters will be used to estimate permeability without core-based or image-based calibration efforts. We successfully validated the introduced workflow on five core-scale samples from different lithofacies taken from three carbonate formations. Estimates of pore-throat radius obtained from the new method were in agreement with those from MICP measurements. We use the estimated pore- and pore-throat radii, tortuosity, and constriction factor for quantification of rock fabric in reliable permeability assessment. The proposed workflow significantly reduced the relative error in permeability estimates by 92%, compared to the conventional permeability models (i.e., calibrated porosity-permeability correlations). Furthermore, the new method eliminates the need for cutoffs and excessive calibration efforts in permeability assessment by honoring and quantifying rock fabric. "

                    "abstract": "Kerogen is often considered to be fully hydrocarbon-wet in reservoir characterization. Wettability of kerogen is, however, not well understood and quantified. Thermal maturation induces changes in the chemical structure of kerogen and alters its oxygen and hydrogen content. This process affects surface properties of kerogen and can influence its wettability. Assumptions made about wettability of kerogen affects interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements such as electromagnetic measurements. It is therefore important to quantify wettability of kerogen as a function of its thermal maturity. The objectives of this paper are to experimentally quantify wettability of kerogen at different thermal maturity levels and to quantify the influence of chemical composition of kerogen on its wettability. In order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, we first isolated kerogen from organic-rich mudrock samples from two different formations at different thermal maturity levels. The extracted kerogen samples are then synthetically matured and the chemical composition of kerogen is quantified using XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer) and pyrolysis. We used the sessile drop method to measure the contact angle, to quantify wettability of kerogen. We then investigated the impacts of thermal maturity and chemical composition of kerogen on its wettability. We tested kerogen samples from two organic-rich mudrock formations (named A and B) and demonstrated experimentally that the wettability of kerogen varies with thermal maturity. Kerogen from formation A at low thermal maturity formed a 44° contact angle of water. However, at higher thermal maturities (heat-treated at 650°C) this contact angle of water increased to 122°. We show that kerogen samples from two organic-rich mudrock formations, heat-treated at 650°C (high thermal maturity), become oil-wet. The results suggest that kerogen is hydrocarbon-wet at high thermal maturity and remains water-wet at low thermal maturity. We also recorded the contact angle in kerogen samples after removal of bitumen generated during synthetic maturation of kerogen using chloroform. We demonstrated that contact angle increases from 44° to 90° and from in 111° to 125° with increase in thermal maturity in formations A and B, respectively. Thus, kerogen becomes hydrocarbon-wet with increasing thermal maturity both with and without the presence of bitumen. The outcomes of this paper improve formation evaluation of organic-rich mudrocks by providing quantitative information on wettability of kerogen. It can also contribute to correcting the assumptions made in reservoir simulators developed for organic-rich mudrocks and can significantly improve our understanding of fluid flow mechanisms in unconventional reservoirs.

However, automatic integration of image logs, conventional logs, and core measurements for rock classification can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic characterization of rock fabric by joint interpretation of image logs and conventional well logs. This method also enables detection of optimum number of rock classes without a priori knowledge of rock types. The objectives of this paper include (a) developing an intelligent rock fabric recognition workflow that uses image logs as inputs, (b) integrating the identified rock fabric with conventional logs and core measurements for rock classification and for selection of optimum rock classes for completion, (c) using the rock classification outcome to improve formation evaluation, and (d) extending the introduced classification workflow to neighboring wells. First, we combine first-order statistics, cross-correlation, and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) methods to extract fabric-related features from image logs. We then integrate the detected fabric-related features with conventional logs and feed them into an unsupervised classification algorithm, called x-means, for optimizing the number of rock classes and rock type detection. After achieving an optimized rock classification, petrophysical models were improved on a class-by-class basis. We successfully applied the proposed method to a data set from the Wolfcamp formation in the Southern Midland Basin and Ozona Arch. The data set consisted of eight wells with image logs, two of which contained detailed core data and description. We use the core measurements and description in these two wells to cross-validate the results from the proposed workflow. Comparison between the optimized rock classes and lithofacies revealed that the proposed method can automatically detect the lithofacies with an error of approximately 15%. The results showed that the estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties of the rocks improved relatively up to 20% compared to the cases where automatic rock fabric detection and image analysis was not implemented as part of the formation evaluation workflow. Analysis of the production data revealed that wells completed within the recommended zones outperform the next tier of wells by approximately 40%. The results showed that quantifying fabric-related features from image logs can be used to improve completion decisions. "

                    "abstract": "Success of the strategies to exploit hydrocarbon reservoirs depends on the availability of reliable information about pore structure and spatial distribution of fluids within the pore space. Reliable quantification of directional pore-space connectivity and characterization of pore architecture are, however, challenging. The objectives of this paper include (1) quantifying the directional connectivity of pore space [connected pore volume (PV)] and rock components, (2) identifying geometry-defined fabric features that contribute to the pore-connectivity variations within the same formation (e.g., tortuosity, constriction factor) and introducing analytical/numerical methods and mechanistic models to estimate them, and (3) improving assessment of hydrocarbon saturation by introducing a new resistivity model that incorporates the directional pore-space-connectivity factor. We introduce a new resistivity model that minimizes calibration efforts and improves assessment of hydrocarbon saturation in complex formations by incorporating a directional connectivity factor. The directional pore-space connectivity is defined as the geometry and texture of the porous media resulting from sedimentary and diagenetic processes, and is estimated with pore-scale images. The directional connectivity factor is a function of electrical tortuosity, and, therefore, we introduce a mechanistic equation that incorporates geometrical features of the pore space to accurately estimate electrical tortuosity. Then, we validate the new tortuosity model against results obtained from a semianalytical streamline algorithm in 3D pore-scale images from each rock type of interest in the formation. The actual electrical tortuosity obtained from numerical simulations is calculated with the geometry of the streamlines associated with the electric current and the corresponding time of flight (TOF) of electric charges. We successfully applied the introduced method to two carbonate formations. The results confirm that the introduced directional-connectivity factor can detect rock-fabric features, through quantifying the connected PV and tortuosity, and that it is a function of the directional-diffusivity coefficient. The quantification of rock fabric and pore-space connectivity improves the estimation of hydrocarbon saturation by 43% compared with conventional methods. The use of such a parameter for rock-fabric characterization from pore-scale images helps to decrease the need for calibration efforts in the interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements. Just a few cuttings from different rock types are sufficient for the proposed method. "

                    "abstract": "Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements have been extensively used for determining porosity, pore-size distribution, and fluid saturation in porous media. However, internal gradients of the magnetic field generated by the presence of paramagnetic or diamagnetic centers such as shale or clay particles can significantly affect NMR response. Consequently, the resulting interpretation for pore-size distribution and porosity is also affected. In this paper, we quantify the effect of internal magnetic-field gradients and spatial distribution of matrix components such as clay minerals on NMR response using pore-scale NMR numerical simulations. We also quantify the influence of the aforementioned parameters on the NMR-based evaluation of porous media. We used the finite-volume method to numerically solve the Bloch (1946) equations and simulated magnetization decay in porous media. We cross validated the reliability of numerical simulations using analytical solutions given for spherical pores in different diffusion regimes. The model was then used for simulation of NMR response in the pore-scale images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. We used Larmor frequency of 2 MHz, external magnetic-field gradient of 0.10 T/m, and half-echo spacing time of 0.5 ms for simulating NMR response in pore-scale images of sandstones and carbonates. We then developed synthetic cases using actual rock images covering a wide range of spatial distribution of clay minerals (i.e., paramagnetic centers) to quantify the sensitivity of NMR decay to internal magnetic-field gradients. We quantified the sensitivity of NMR response for distribution of clays as thin laminae in the rock and as thin layers on the surface of the grains. The results showed that at low concentration (0.3 to 0.7%) of dispersed clay, there is a negligible effect of internal magnetic-field gradients on magnetization decay. At higher concentration of dispersed clay (5.1 to 7.3%), we observed a significant effect of internal magnetic-field gradients on magnetization decay. The presence of shale minerals can cause 53% variation in the location of the transverse-relaxation-time constant (T2) and up to 67% relative error in the assessment of dominant pore sizes. Shale laminations containing clay were found to produce an effect of up to 31.8% on T2 relaxation-time constant, which could cause a relative error of 50.0% in estimates of dominant pore size in the rock. The outcomes of this paper demonstrated the effect of heterogeneous rock mineralogy on NMR response. The effect of internal magnetic-field gradients generated by shale and clay on NMR becomes relevant when shale and clay particles are close to the pore fluid and their magnetic field starts to affect the distribution of magnetic field in the pore space. The results reveal the importance of characterizing the distribution of shale and clay minerals before interpreting NMR response and can potentially improve conventional techniques of pore-network characterization (pore-size distribution and pore volume) in the presence of clay minerals where internal magnetic-field gradients are not negligible.

                    "abstract": "Reliable estimation of kerogen density is a requirement for dependable well-log-based petrophysical evaluation of organic-rich mudrocks. As kerogen matures, hydrocarbons are generated and the chemical structure of kerogen is transformed, which can lead to measurable variations in kerogen density. Uncertainty in estimates of kerogen density can significantly impact the reliability of well-log interpretation results. The objectives of this research are (a) to experimentally quantify the density of kerogen isolated from a variety of organic-rich mudrocks with different origins, (b) to investigate the impact of thermal maturity on kerogen density, and (c) to investigate the impact of synthetic maturation on density of kerogen. We used organic-rich mudrock samples from four formations, to cover a wide range in kerogen thermal maturity. We isolated kerogen from these mudrock samples and estimated the density of the naturally and synthetically matured isolated kerogen samples. The experimental results indicated that the density of kerogen varies significantly among organic-rich mudrocks with different origins. We recorded densities ranging from 1.19 to 1.77 g/cm3 in kerogen samples when the hydrogen index varied from 603 to 48 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. We also observed that kerogen density increases as a function of thermal maturity. Sensitivity analysis confirmed a measurable impact of kerogen density on estimates of petrophysical properties, such as porosity and water saturation in organic-rich mudrocks. The documented experimental results and procedures can be used to enhance petrophysical evaluation of organic-rich mudrocks, by taking into account the impact of kerogen thermal maturity in the models used for interpretation of core or well-log measurements. Introduction Kerogen disseminated in organic-rich mudrocks presents challenges when performing well-log-based petrophysical evaluation. One such challenge is the lack of reliable estimates of kerogen density in organic-rich mudrocks. Inaccuracies in estimates of kerogen density can negatively influence assessments of porosity, mineralogy, and water saturation in organic-rich mudrocks. "

                    "abstract": "Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) logging is a well-established technology for estimating porosity, pore-size distribution, and permeability in conventional reservoirs. However, the uncertainty associated with these estimates can be significant in complex heterogeneous-carbonate reservoirs, such as those with variable pore size and pore-network connectivity. In such cases, distinguishing isolated-pore space is often impossible by use of well-log measurements and conventional well-log-interpretation methods, which makes permeability evaluation unreliable. This paper proposes a new application of the NMR log-inject-log method to improve assessment of permeability and to distinguish isolated pores from connected pores. We propose injecting manganesebearing solution in the rock samples and simultaneously analyze NMR measurements before and after injection of the contrast solution. Injection of contrast agents enables eliminating the effect of isolated-pore space from the NMR T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) distribution, which is then used to improve permeability assessment. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for field applications, we conduct NMR laboratory measurements in two carbonate-rock types. We inject manganese-bearing solution into rock samples by use of a coreflood experimental procedure and measure NMR T2 distributions before and after injection. We then estimate isolated porosity and interconnected porosity by taking into account the difference between the NMR T2 distributions acquired before and after the injection of the contrast solution. We introduce a method to calculate the geometric mean of the T2 distribution for interconnected pores, and also to obtain effective free-fluid volume and bound-fluid volume. Finally, we use the T2 distribution corrected for the effect of isolated pores in conventional NMR-based permeability models to improve permeability assessment. We cross validate the NMR-based permeability estimates against Klinkenberg permeability measured by an unsteady-state gas permeameter. The results confirm that the proposed method enables quantifying the isolated and connected pore volume (PV), and finally improves NMR-based permeability assessment. The new method provides estimates of permeability with up to 10% average error in eight carbonate-rock samples, which was a significant improvement compared with the average errors of up to 500% when T2 distribution is not corrected for the effect of isolated pores.

                    "abstract": "Conventional rock classification in carbonate reservoirs typically requires considerable amount of core data, which usually may not be available at the depth resolution required for each target interval. In cases of tight carbonate rocks with extremely low porosity (less than 5% in average) and permeability (less than 0.1 md), a reliable rock classification is essential for well stimulation modeling. Such rock classification should take into account depth-by-depth petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties of the formation. In this paper, we apply an integrated rock classification technique to enhance (a) well-log-based estimates of petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties and (b) selection of appropriate candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design in a tight carbonate reservoir in northern slope of Tazhong Uplift, Tarim Basin, China. We first perform multi-mineral analysis and estimate volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and fluid saturations. Since shear wave sonic logs are not available in most of the wells, we estimate elastic moduli using effective medium models including self-consistent approximation and differential effective medium theory. Corrections including the impact of fluids are developed using Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution. The inputs to the effective medium models include (a) the petrophysical and compositional properties obtained from well logs, (b) bulk and shear moduli for each mineral and fluid component, and (c) shape of rock inclusions (i.e., grains and pores). Core measurements are used for cross validating the well-log-based estimates of elastic moduli and petrophysical properties. Accordingly, we proposed a rock classification technique using unsupervised neural network that integrated depth-by-depth volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and elastic moduli. Finally, we derived permeability models in each rock type and estimated the permeability in the target depth intervals. Variogram analysis on well-log-based estimates of permeability provides correlation lengths as inputs to acid fracturing treatment modeling. We successfully applied the technique introduced here to a challenging tight gas interval of Tarim field in China. The estimated porosity and permeability were in good agreement with laboratory core measurements. The identified rock classes were verified by core samples and thin sections. We estimated elastic moduli with average relative errors of approximately 13% compare to the core measurements. The estimated elastic moduli were used as a key input for modeling of acid-fracturing treatments and improved stimulation success. The rock classification technique introduced here provides important input parameters for well stimulation modeling, gives insight into evaluation of acid fracturing in tight carbonate reservoir, and helps with selection of best candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design.

                    "abstract": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements can be used for quantifying rock wettability because they are sensitive to the type of fluids in contact with grains. Conventional experimental NMR-based methods for wettability determination often need NMR response for the same rock sample in different wettability states at irreducible water saturation and at residual oil saturation, which is time-consuming and could provide non-unique results. There also exist simulation-based methods for characterizing wettability in mixed-wet rocks. These methods either assume oversimplified pore shapes or require microComputed Tomography (CT) images of partially-saturated mixed-wet rock samples and complex image processing algorithms, which makes them computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce a new NMR-based wettability index for characterizing rock wettability and test its applicability in both carbonate and sandstone rock samples using numerical simulations. The new NMR-based wettability index is a function of measured transverse magnetization (72) of mixed-wet rock, bulk relaxation and saturation of each phase, and simulated T2 distributions for fully water-saturated and fully hydrocarbon-saturated. We then use pore-scale simulation of NMR at different wettability states to verify the applicability and reliability of the newly introduced wettability index in rock samples with different pore structures including carbonate and sandstone samples. The first step in model verification is to obtain pore-scale images of few rock samples in each rock type in the formation. We then perform simulation of NMR T2 response for rocks with different wettability levels by numerically solving Bloch-Torrey equation using finite volume method. Then we generate mixed-wet synthetic samples, simulate the T2 response in the synthetic samples, and use the simulation results as inputs for determining their NMR-based wettability index. The results demonstrate the reliability of the new NMR-derived wettability index. The introduced NMR-based method for wettability assessment allows for determination of wettability at any saturation state in the rock samples. It also eliminates the need for NMR calibration at irreducible water saturation and residual oil saturation and thus, might reduce the overall time required for determining wettability of mixed-wet samples. Successful application of the introduced workflow expedites assessment of wettability index and wettability changes in mixed-wet reservoir rocks. "

                    "abstract": "High-frequency dielectric measurements have been attractive candidates for assessment of water-filled porosity in porous media. In the presence of saline water, the water molecules lose their orientation freedom partially because of hydration with ions and make these measurements sensitive to water salinity, which makes the interpretation of the dielectric-permittivity measurements challenging. The effects of water salinity on the real and the imaginary parts of dielectric permittivity have not yet been quantitatively studied in highfrequency (e.g., greater than 1 GHz) measurements. We measured dielectric permittivity of brine at frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 3 GHz at room temperature and pressure conditions, where water salinity varies between 0 and 160 kiloparts per million (kppm). We also measured the dielectric permittivity of rock samples with different brine saturations. Our experimental results confirmed that there exists a critical frequency above which water salinity does not affect the real part of the dielectric constant, and such critical frequency increases as water-filled porosity and water salinity increase. At high frequencies where the real part of the dielectric constant is independent of the frequency, there exists a critical water-filled porosity below which water salinity has negligible effect on the real part of the dielectric constant. However, when water-filled porosity is higher than this critical value, the real part of the dielectric constant slightly decreases by increasing water salinity. Further, the results showed that at frequencies greater than the critical frequency, there is a critical water salinity below which the imaginary part of the dielectric constant increases as the water salinity increases, whereas the imaginary part of the dielectric constant decreases if the water salinity exceeds the critical value. The quantitative results on the effect of water salinity on dielectric measurements can potentially improve interpretation of dielectric-permittivity measurements for reliable assessment of water-filled porosity and hydrocarbon saturation.

                    "abstract": "Natural fractures have been widely found and thought to be an important factor in creating a complex hydraulic fractures network and improving hydrocarbon production in shale reservoirs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is extensively applied to measure in-situ petrophysical properties, and magnetic nanoparticles provide good contrast agents to distinguish hydrogen relaxation time for NMR. The objective of this paper was to estimate spatial distribution of natural fractures in shale gas reservoirs by applying magnetic nanoparticles to change the NMR relaxation times. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3D) reservoir model including multiple natural fractures was built to investigate the flow of nanoparticles and the distribution of volume magnetic susceptibility (VMS) when injecting magnetic nanoparticles. The sensitivity analyses about nanoparticle concentration and nanoparticles size were investigated. Secondly, a forward model was introduced about how to obtain Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo decay trains from given relaxation times. Thirdly, an inversion method was presented to convert the typical CPMG echo decay curve into the distribution of T2 relaxation amplitudes and times. The inversion method was used to show the change of T2 amplitude and time for the two synthetic cases with and without magnetic nanoparticles. The dynamic distribution of nanoparticles concentration and VMS are graphically displayed along each time step in 3D mesh. The results show that magnetic nanoparticles bring much larger VMS while most nanoparticles only flow into these natural fractures (NF) directly connected with wellbore. The others’ NF have somewhat higher VMS than matrix. Additionally, based on various sensitivity cases, a higher concentration of nanoparticles yields a stronger magnetic field, and larger nanoparticle size could lead to higher VMS, although the nanoparticles face stronger flow resistance and less diffusion movement. The CPMG decay curve is a multi-dimensional exponential function related to relaxation amplitudes and times, and the least squares minimization technique can be applied to obtain the T2 amplitudes from CPMG curve. The comparison between two synthetic cases shows the amplitude for small T2 time increases and the amplitude for large T2 time reduces, which provides a clear indicator to detect the locations of natural fractures because their T2 largely reduce. The nanoparticle model provides valuable guidance about choosing parameters for optimizing magnetic nanoparticle injection design to enhance VMS and NMR signals. The inversion model introduces an efficient path for estimating T2 distribution and petrophysical properties from the acquired NMR CPMG signals. Additionally, magnetic Nanoparticles provide excellent relaxation contrasts to distinguish the magnetization signals of formation for estimating the spatial natural fractures distribution. Consequently, in-situ fracture characterization and the development of hydraulic fracture treatments could be beneficially improved. "

                    "abstract": "Reliability of core measurement and analysis can be highly dependent on the humidity of measurement environment. However, impact of humidity on core measurements is often assumed to be negligible. This paper quantified the influence of relative humidity on the hydration of clay minerals (i.e., montmorillonite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The influence of clay hydration on the assessment of fluid volume in organic-rich mudrocks was also investigated. The NMR T2 (spin-spin relaxation) magnetic decay of the clay samples showed existence of water even after the samples were dried in an oven at 95 °C. The TGA measurements in clay minerals confirmed the weight loss between 95 °C and dehydroxylation temperature, which is approximately the same volume as that recorded by NMR measurement in dried samples. This recorded water volume corresponded to desorption of water molecules bound to interlayer cations (i.e., interlayer water). In the case of the hydration water, the NMR-based water vapor adsorption experiments showed that the volume of water accumulated on the surface of clay minerals increased significantly as the relative humidity increased. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) measurements of clay minerals demonstrated that the volume of hydration water was strongly related to the CEC. The volume of interlayer water was, however, not related to the CEC. In the case of organic-rich mudrocks, water vapor adsorption experiments showed > 250% change in water volume when relative humidity varies in the range of 0% to 95%, which further verified the significant impact of humidity on core measurements and the necessity of applying corrections for such an impact.

                    "abstract": "The importance of the clay-network conductivity in resistivity-based saturation assessment has been well recognized over the years. The existing shaly sand models are oversimplified by assuming that the clays are present in the rock predominantly as laminated, dispersed, or structural. This assumption, however, is not reliable in many clay-rich formations because, in nature, clay minerals can have complex spatial distributions. Furthermore, the conventional shaly sand resistivity models such as Waxman-Smits, Dual-Water, Simandoux, and Indonesia do not take into account spatial distribution and connectivity of clay network. Spatial distribution of clay network can significantly affect resistivity of clay-rich formations and oversimplifying this distribution can lead to huge uncertainties in estimates of water saturation in such formations. In this paper, we introduce a new resistivity-based model which quantitatively takes into account the actual clay-network geometry and distribution and type of clay minerals. Reliable incorporation of spatial distribution of clay network (i.e., not limited to extreme cases of dispersed, layered, and structural) improves reserves evaluation in clay-rich formations with complex clay network structure. The new resistivity model incorporates directional pore-network connectivity of each conductive component of the rock that forms a percolating network. The directional connectivity is calculated as a function of the volume fractions and rock fabric features such as directional tortuosity and constriction factor of each rock component. The aforementioned rock fabric features are quantitatively evaluated from the three-dimensional (3D) pore-scale images. We scan core samples from clay-rich formations using a high-resolution micro- Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. Then, we perform trainable segmentation on each set of two-dimensional (2D) raw images to identify different rock components and pores. The 2D segmented images are then converted into a 3D volume. We apply a semi-analytical streamline model to estimate the network connectivity and tortuosity of the conductive components from the 3D binary images, which will be inputs to the introduced model. We successfully applied the introduced model in several synthetic rock samples as well as in actual clay-rich rock samples including a shaly formation and a mudrock. The electrical conductivity, estimated from numerical simulations, was in agreement with the resistivity estimates from the new model. Comparison of the results against conventional methods showed that saturation estimates were improved by up to 50% in more than 60% of the samples after quantitatively taking into account spatial distribution of clay network. The outcomes of this paper are promising for successful application of the introduced model for improved in-situ assessment of hydrocarbon saturation through assimilating the impacts of rock fabric and spatial distribution of clay networks on electrical resistivity measurements.

However, there exist many formations, such as organic-rich mudrocks and carbonates, which have a broad range of wettability from fully oil-wet to mixed-wet. Wettability has a strong effect on the fluid distribution within the pore network and it consequently has to be taken into account by rock physics models which are used to estimate hydrocarbon reserves. Quantitative evaluation of wettability and its impact on physical properties of reservoirs can significantly improve formation evaluation techniques and secondary recovery strategies. In this paper, we narrow down the knowledge gap for oil-wet and mixed-wet formations by developing a new analytical resistivity model, which can reliably estimate hydrocarbon reserves at different levels of wettability. The objectives of this paper include (a) to quantify the influence of wettability on electrical resistivity measurement, (b) to develop a new analytical resistivity model that takes into account the impacts of wettability on electrical resistivity, and (c) to improve the assessment of hydrocarbon saturation by introducing a wettability-dependent parameter into a new resistivity method. The new resistivity method not only incorporates the wettability-dependent parameter, but also directional conducting fractional pore network to honor complex rock fabric. The incorporation of rock fabric and wettability in the new resistivity-saturation method is required for improved quantitative evaluation of borehole geophysical measurement such as electromagnetic logs. The aforementioned features are quantitatively evaluated from the three-dimensional (3D) pore-scale images, taken from each rock type in the formation. Then, we apply a semi-analytical streamline numerical model to estimate electrical resistivity and pore-network connectivity in the 3D binary images. The resistivity and the calculated geometry-related parameters are used as inputs to the new model in order to estimate water saturation. To test the performance of the introduced method in a wide range of wettability and water saturation, we synthetically saturate the pore-scale images with water and oil at different wettability configurations and water saturation, honoring the physics of intermolecular interactions between different fluid and solid components. The results obtained from the new method are compared against the actual saturation. We successfully applied the introduced method to a carbonate rock sample with wettability condition ranging from strongly oil-wet to strongly water-wet. The electrical resistivity results obtained from numerical simulations were in agreement with the resistivity estimates from the new method. The results also showed that wettability has a significant influence on electrical resistivity of the rocks at water saturation levels below 50%. The outcomes of this paper are promising for welllog- based applications of the new method in complex mixed-wet formations. "

Furthermore, the effects of thermal maturity on elastic properties of kerogen are not well understood. The primary objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of thermal maturity on elastic properties of kerogen. We measure elastic properties of isolated kerogen samples, at the micron-scale level of investigation. We perform nanoindentation tests on compacted kerogen samples at different levels of synthetic thermal maturation. Then, we quantify the impact of kerogen thermal maturity on effective elastic properties in mudrocks. We also evaluate the relationship between elastic properties, hydrogen index, and electrical resistivity in the synthetically-matured kerogen samples. We first performed kerogen extraction from organic-rich mudrock samples using chemical and physical techniques without changing chemical structure of kerogen. We then used mechanical compaction to create solid disks of isolated type II and type III kerogen samples. We synthetically matured the kerogen samples using heat treatment to obtain kerogen samples at four different levels of thermal maturity. Nanoindentation mechanical tests were then performed on kerogen samples using minimal overburden load to obtain the Young’s modulus and hardness of each sample. Finally, we performed sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of thermal maturity and variation of kerogen elastic properties on effective elastic properties of the rock. Results showed that Young’s modulus varies as a function of thermal maturity of kerogen. Young’s moduli of kerogen samples initially decrease as the thermal maturity increases and then start to continuously increase. This pattern is consistent with electrical conductivity of the samples. The initial decrease in Young’s modulus can be due to elimination of water molecules from the samples. At higher heat-treatment temperatures, the increase in Young’s moduli can be explained by changes in kerogen structures, including increase in aromaticity and graphitization. The outcomes of this paper enable a better understanding of the effects of thermal maturity of kerogen on its mechanical properties in organic-rich mudrocks. The measured mechanical properties can help to create a database of static elastic properties of kerogen at different burial depths and thermal maturation levels. Furthermore, the results can potentially improve well-log-based assessment of rock mechanical properties in formations with high organic content. "

Imprecise estimation of these properties results in significant uncertainties in the interpretation of well logs for reserves evaluation. Quantifying the impacts of thermal maturity and chemical composition of kerogen on dielectric constant leads to improved interpretation of dielectric logs. In a recent publication, we showed that thermal maturity of kerogen can significantly affect its dielectric properties and estimates of water-filled porosity. However, a quantitative relationship between thermal maturity and dielectric properties of kerogen, which is required for well-log-based model development in organic-rich mudrocks, is yet to be investigated. The objectives of this paper include (a) quantifying the correlation between thermal maturity and dielectric constant of kerogen through laboratory measurements and (b) linking chemical composition of kerogen to its dielectric constant. To achieve the aforementioned goals, we developed a microwave setup to measure the dielectric constant of kerogen at different thermal maturity levels. We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyze the elemental composition and to quantify the effects of thermal maturity on the chemical composition of kerogen. We performed measurements on kerogen samples from two organic-rich mudrock formations. We observed that the dielectric constant increases significantly with thermal maturity in both formations. The XPS measurements also showed an increase in the aromatic carbon concentration with thermal maturity, which could explain the increase in the dielectric constant. We then directly quantified the relationship between aromatic content and dielectric constant of kerogen in the two formations. The outcomes of this paper enable selecting reliable dielectric constant values for kerogen as inputs to dielectric models for well-log interpretation. Reliable assumptions for kerogen dielectric constant improve well-log-based interpretation for fluid saturations. In field applications, XPS measurements performed on rock cuttings, could be used for selecting a reliable dielectric constant for kerogen. This enables real-time quantification of the influence of kerogen on dielectric measurements, which improves interpretation of these measurements. "

                    "title": "Pore-Scale Numerical Modeling of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Response in Rocks With Complex Pore Structure Using Finite Volume Method",
                    "abstract": "Evaluation of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements can be challenging in the presence of complex pore structure where impacts of diffusional coupling and wettability are not negligible. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty in evaluation of NMR response in organic-rich mudrocks, because of tight pore network and contribution of different relaxation mechanisms. Pore-scale modeling has been shown to be successful in addressing the aforementioned challenges. NMR response can be modeled by solving Bloch equations. The use of finite element and finite volume methods for solving Block equations and understanding NMR response has been limited as the computation of complex magnetization terms in Bloch equations makes these methods less efficient. Random walk algorithms are popular techniques for modeling NMR response. The reliability of random walk algorithms, however, depends on the number of walkers used to cover the pore space, which can make them computationally expensive for complex pore geometries. The objectives of this paper are to extend the use of finite volume techniques for quick modelling of NMR response in porous media, to demonstrate the reliability of the modeling process in formations with complex pore geometry and fluid compositions, and to test its application in quantitative evaluation of petrophysical properties of porous media. We introduced a pore-scale finite volume simulation technique for modelling NMR response, taking into account both externally applied and internal magnetic gradients. The complex magnetization terms in Bloch equations are usually formulated as constant source terms. Accurate simulation of these terms requires a small time step which is computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we demonstrated that the complex magnetization terms can be modelled as time varying source terms, for free diffusion regime which speed up the simulations. The developed simulator takes pore-scale images of rock samples, topology of different fluid phases, and bulk and surface properties of fluids as inputs. The outputs of the developed simulator include results for Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG), Inversion Recovery (IR), and Pulsed Field Gradient (PFG)-CPMG pulse sequences. We simulated the response from the aforementioned pulse sequences in simple spheres for validation of the simulation algorithm and for its speed evaluation, and in micro-Computed Tomography (CT) of both sandstone and carbonate samples. Furthermore, we compared the results from the new method against the ones from a random walk algorithm for CPMG sequence in both sandstones and carbonates. We then synthetically introduced changes in pore structure and fluid compositions and simulated NMR response in all rock pore scale images and synthetic samples. The introduced method was more than 10 times faster than a previously developed random walk algorithm. The relative difference between the simulation results using the random walk algorithm and the finite volume method was less than 10% for the actual rock samples, documented in this paper. The outcomes of this paper demonstrate the reliability of the simple finite volume method, which can be used to improve the speed of NMR-based petrophysical evaluation in formations with complex pore geometry and relaxation mechanisms.

                    "abstract": "Inconsistencies are commonplace in identifying petrophysical rock classes and geological depositional facies in carbonate formations. Different diagenetic processes may cause the same geological facies to exhibit different petrophysical properties. These inconsistencies can be overcome by quantitatively taking into account spatial distribution of pore network and rock fabric in rock classification and petrophysical evaluation. Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP)-based pore typing does take into account the pore structure through pore size distribution. However, such measurements are not commonly available in all wells and depth intervals of interest. Furthermore, welllog- based rock classification techniques do not take into account rock fabric and require the number of rock classes as an input parameter. There is often uncertainty in the optimum number of rock classes, which mainly roots in the differences between petrophysical rock classes and the geological depositional facies. In this paper, we introduce a method to (a) evaluate pore network connectivity and geometry as rock fabric using combined evaluation of pore- and log-scale measurements in each rock class, (b) improve rock classification in carbonate formations by simultaneously evaluating conducting porosity, permeability, and rock classes in the formation, and (c) optimize the number of rock classes in the formation. The first step includes conventional well-log interpretation to obtain volumetric concentrations of minerals and petrophysical properties. We assumed an initial number for the number of rock classes, which can be obtained from geofacies characterization. We used the well-log-based estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties as inputs to initial well-logbased rock classification using an unsupervised neural network. We then obtained high-resolution pore-scale images of core subsamples at different rock classes and conducted pore-scale numerical simulations of electrical current and fluid flow. The simulation results are used to develop models that quantify the relationship between electrical resistivity, conducting porosity, and permeability. We applied these models to log-scale domain to improve permeability estimates and used these estimates to update the rock classification. We update the number of rock classes and repeat the aforementioned process until a convergence in permeability estimates is achieved. The outcome of this iterative method include depth-by-depth rock classification, permeability estimates, and the optimum number of rock classes. The introduced method was successfully applied to two wells in a carbonate formation. The outcomes of rock classification were in good agreement with the geological depositional facies. The iterative method resulted in significant improvement in permeability estimates in the log-scale domain when compared against conventional porosity-permeability correlations. Furthermore, this method effectively optimized the number of rock classes, making it a promising approach for field cases with limited core measurements and no prior knowledge about the rock classes. Results also confirmed that the proposed workflow enables quantification of the rock fabric that contributes to fluid flow. It also links petrophysical and geological depositional facies, which is critical in characterizing complex carbonate formations. "

                    "abstract": "The technique of water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection has been widely applied to improve sweep efficiency of gas injections in depleted oil fields. However, injectivity abnormalities have been a limiting factor, adversely affecting the success and the economic feasibility of WAG projects. Heterogeneous distribution of petrophysical properties in carbonate formations is among the parameters causing injectivity loss during WAG cycles. WAG injection reduces the effective fluid mobility in all rock classes, irrespective of their petrophysical properties and flow characteristics. Thus, a larger fraction of fluids flow into the rock classes of higher permeability, resulting in a poor frontal advancement in rock classes of lower permeability. This leads to reduced overall injectivity and loss of WAG operation efficiency. In this paper, we investigate and quantify the effect of spatial heterogeneity in a carbonate formation on injectivity loss during WAG injection. We conduct automatic rock classification on the basis of conventional well logs by use of an unsupervised artificial-neural-network method to characterize the rapid vertical variation of petrophysical properties and mineralogy in a carbonate formation. We then apply a new heterogeneity coefficient to quantify the spatial distribution of rock classes. The introduced heterogeneity coefficient is validated by use of principal-component analysis (PCA) and variogram analysis. The aforementioned technique was applied to 10 wells of the Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee (SACROC) Unit in west Texas that were subjected to WAG operation. Five of the selected wells in this field exhibited no injectivity abnormality, whereas the other five wells experienced unexpected low gas injectivity during carbon dioxide (CO2) injection and an apparent reduction in water injectivity during the follow-up brine injection. Rock classification generated three rock classes on the basis of mercury-injection capillary pressure (MICP) data and the distribution of porosity, permeability, pore types, and clay content, with Rock Classes 1, 2, and 3 having the best, intermediate, and worse rock quality, respectively. We quantified magnitude of the spatial heterogeneity on the basis of the distribution of rock classes in all 10 wells. We then investigated the effect of heterogeneity on the injectivity loss during WAG injection by comparing the identified heterogeneity coefficients in all wells. The results showed that in the wells with WAG-injectivity loss, the distribution of rock classes is approximately 30% more heterogeneous compared with the wells with no injectivity loss. In the wells with injectivity loss, we also observed approximately 32 and 43% higher occurrence of Rock Classes 1 and 2, respectively, compared with the wells with no injectivity loss. An analysis of the spatial heterogeneity can be applied to improve selection of candidate wells for WAG injection and success of oil recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Complex pore geometry and composition, as well as anisotropic behavior and heterogeneity, can affect physical properties of rocks such as electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity. The aforementioned physical properties are used to estimate in-situ petrophysical properties of the formation such as hydrocarbon saturation. In the application of conventional methods for interpretation of electrical-resistivity (e.g., Archie’s equation and the dual-water model) and dielectric-permittivity measurements [e.g., complex refractive index model (CRIM)], the impacts of complex pore structure (e.g., kerogen porosity and intergranular pores), pyrite, and conductive mature kerogen have not been taken into account. These limitations cause significant uncertainty in estimates of water saturation. In this paper, we introduce a new method that combines interpretation of dielectric-permittivity and electrical-resistivity measurements to improve assessment of hydrocarbon saturation. The combined interpretation of dielectric-permittivity and electrical-resistivity measurements enables assimilating spatial distribution of rock components (e.g., pore, kerogen, and pyrite networks) in conventional models. We start with pore-scale numerical simulations of electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity of fluid-bearing porous media to investigate the structure of pore and matrix constituents in these measurements. The inputs to these simulators are 3D pore-scale images. We then introduce an analytical model that combines resistivity and permittivity measurements to assess water-filled porosity and hydrocarbon saturation. We apply the new method to actual digital sandstones and synthetic digital organic-rich mudrock samples. The relative errors (compared with actual values estimated from image processing) in the estimate of water-filled porosity through our new method are all within the 10% range. In the case of digital sandstone samples, CRIM provided reasonable estimates of water-filled porosity, with only four out of twenty-one estimates beyond 10% relative error, with the maximum error of 30%. However, in the case of synthetic digital organic-rich mudrocks, six out of ten estimates for water-filled porosity were beyond 10% with CRIM, with the maximum error of 40%. Therefore, the improvement was more significant in the case of organic-rich mudrocks with complex pore structure. In the case of synthetic digital organic-rich mudrock samples, our simulation results confirm that not only the pore structure but also spatial distribution and tortuosity of water, kerogen, and pyrite networks affect the measurements of dielectric permittivity and electrical resistivity. Taking into account these parameters through the joint interpretation of dielectric-permittivity and electrical-resistivity measurements significantly improves assessment of hydrocarbon saturation.

The basic advantage of the NMR method is that oil, gas, and water possess different NMR properties. Therefore, they can be distinguished quantitatively. In this work we have combined NMR Laboratory methods and pore-scale numerical simulations, with MRI techniques in order to elucidate the oil/water-rock interactions of mixed-wet carbonates at molecular scale and on the basis of this information to acquire a quantitative measure of wettability. T2, D and D-T2 NMR measurements were performed on limestone core. Water and two types of oil, with different viscosities, were used in the experiments. Pore-scale numerical simulations of magnetization decay on samples taken from both rock types in the presence of different spatial distribution of fluid saturations and wettability assumptions were performed using a random walk algorithm. A sensitivity analysis were performed on the impact of wettability on T2 distribution in the two rock types. The T2 and D distributions were extracted from measured magnetization decay by implementing a new non-negative Tikhonov regularization algorithm, while for the D-T2 experiments a 2-D version of this algorithm was developed and implemented. For the MRI experiments CPMG trains were implemented for calculated T2 Images, and Diffusion Tensor Imaging methods, in order to acquire spatially resolved T2 and D values.

                    "abstract": "Fracture-density evaluation has always been challenging for the petroleum industry, although it is a required characteristic for reliable reservoir characterization. Production can be directly controlled by fracture density, especially in tight reservoirs. Previous publications showed that use of high thermal neutron-capture cross-sectional (HTNCC) contrast agents can enhance the sensitivity of neutron logs to the presence of fractures. However, all these studies focus on locating the proppants. In this paper, we introduce a method of injecting electrically transported charged boron carbide (B4C) contrast agents to naturally fractured formations to enhance the propagation of the contrast agents into the secondary-fracture (natural and induced) network by use of an externally applied electric field and to characterize the fracture density in the unpropped region by use of the enhanced neutron porosity logs. We perform numerical simulations to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. A physical model derived from electrophoretic velocity and material-balance formulations is proposed and solved to simulate the spatial distribution of contrast agents. Furthermore, we simulate neutron porosity logs by solving the neutron-diffusion equation, which allows a fast analysis for the proposed technique. The simulation results confirmed that an external electric field can significantly enhance the transport of charged contrast agents into the secondary-fracture network. Sensitivity analysis revealed that increasing particle f-potential can efficiently decrease the transport time. Furthermore, we applied the introduced technique on synthetic cases with variable secondary-fracture density ranging from 1 to 8%. The relative variation in the simulated neutron porosity before and after applying the electric potential field was up to 50% in a formation with 8% fracture density after applying an electric field for 6 hours. The proposed technique can potentially enable application of neutron porosity logs in fracture characterization, including assessment of secondary-fracture density, if combined with other well logs.

                    "abstract": "Success of the strategies to exploit hydrocarbon reservoirs depends on the availability of reliable information about pore structure and spatial distribution of fluids within the pore network. Reliable quantification of directional pore network connectivity and characterization of pore architecture is, however, challenging. The objectives of this paper include (a) quantifying the directional connectivity of pore network and rock components, (b) investigating the consistency of the estimated directional connectivity at a given rock type in the formation, (c) identifying geometry-defined fabric features that cause the connectivity variations within the same formation, and (d) improving assessment of hydrocarbon saturation using the introduced quantitative directional pore-network connectivity factor. We introduce a new directional pore-network connectivity factor to quantify rock fabric. In order to evaluate its consistency in pore- and log-scale domains in the same rock types, the first step includes rock classification based on well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical/compositional properties. Then rock samples from each rock type are scanned using a micro-Computed Tomography (CT) scanner, processed, and digitized into pore and grain regions. Afterwards, the pore-network connectivity of the three-dimensional (3D) pore-scale images are obtained using a semianalytical streamline algorithm. The geometrical features are quantitatively evaluated from these images and combined with the estimated connectivity. The new quantitative connectivity factor is finally used to improve evaluation of electrical resistivity logs for assessment of hydrocarbon saturation. We successfully applied the introduced method to a carbonate formation. The results confirmed that the introduced directional connectivity factor can detect rock fabric features and is a function of the directional diffusivity coefficient. This parameter remains persistent in the same rock type in the formation, which enables a reliable and enhanced interpretation of electrical resistivity logs in formations with complex pore structure. The quantification of rock fabric and pore network connectivity improved the estimation of hydrocarbon saturation by up to 61% when compared to conventional methods. The use of such parameter for rock fabric characterization minimizes the need for calibration efforts in interpretation of borehole geophysical measurements. Few cuttings from different rock types are sufficient for the proposed method. "

                    "abstract": "NMR (Nuclear magnetic Resonance) measurements have been extensively used for characterizing porosity and pore size distribution with assumption of constant magnetic field gradient within porous media. However, internal gradients of magnetic field generated due to the presence of paramagnetic or diamagnetic centers such as clay particles can significantly affect NMR response and the resulting interpretation for pore-size distribution and porosity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of internal magnetic gradients and spatial distribution of matrix components such as clay minerals on NMR response using pore-scale NMR numerical simulations. We also quantify the influence of the aforementioned parameters on the NMR-based evaluation of porous media. We used finite volume method to numerically solve Bloch equations (Bloch 1946) and simulated magnetization decay in porous media. We cross-validated the reliability of numerical simulations using analytical solutions given for spherical pores in different diffusion regimes. The model is then used for simulation of NMR response in the pore-scale images of sandstone and carbonate rocks. We developed synthetic cases based on actual rock images covering a wide range of spatial distribution of clay minerals (i.e., paramagnetic or diamagnetic centers) to quantify the sensitivity of NMR decay to internal magnetic gradients. We quantified the sensitivity of NMR response for distribution of clays as random dispersion in the rock grains, as thin laminae in the rock and as thin layers on the surface of grains. The results showed that at low concentration (e.g., 0.3%-0.7%) of dispersed clay, there is negligible impact of internal magnetic gradients on magnetization decay. At higher concentration of dispersed clay (e.g., 5.1%-7.3%), we observed significant impact of internal magnetic gradients on magnetization decay. The presence of clay minerals can cause 53% variation in the location of transverse relaxation time constant (T2) and up to 67% relative error in assessment of dominant pore sizes. We also observed that structural clays even at high volumetric concentrations of 40% produce negligible effect on NMR measurements. Shale laminations containing clay were found to produce an effect of up to 17.5% on T2 relaxation time constant that could cause a relative error of 23.1% in estimates of dominant pore size in the rock. The outcomes of this paper can potentially improve conventional techniques of pore network characterization (pore-size distribution and pore volume) in the presence of clay minerals where internal magnetic gradients are not negligible.

                    "abstract": "The strength and conductivity of proppant packs are key parameters for assessing proppant-pack performance. Mechanical damage in the propping agents, which leads to compaction and crushing, significantly reduces the conductivity of the proppant pack. Mechanical damage of proppants is usually analyzed by use of crush tests. However, measurements from these tests remain questionable because of discrepancies in procedures and test results. Therefore, a need emerges to develop techniques for characterizing the properties and mechanical damage in proppant packs. In this paper, we introduced a new technique that is based on interpretation of acoustic measurements from a granular effective-media model to quantify mechanical damage in propping agents. We performed uniaxial compression tests in the laboratory and measured the compressional- and shear-wave velocities in proppant packs loaded at axial stresses ranging from 10 to 110 MPa. After unloading the tests in which maximum axial stresses of 28, 55, 69, 97, and 110 MPa were applied, we conducted sieve analysis on the proppant packs. We applied an effective-medium theory modeled after the Hertz-Mindlin granular contact model to approximate the effective elastic properties. We then calibrated the model by use of the elastic properties estimated from the experimental measurements to characterize the mechanical damage of the proppant packs. We observed that the increase in grain-to-grain contact as the axial stress increases results in compaction and crushing in the proppant pack. We showed that the compaction effects and elastic and plastic behaviors in the stress–strain profile of the proppant pack were in agreement with the analysis of fines generated at different stress levels. The combined effect of compaction and crushing resulted in a reduction of porosity and, consequently, decreased the compressional- and shear-wave velocities of the proppant pack. The Hertz-Mindlin model showed a good approximation of the effective elastic properties estimated from the acoustic-wave velocities when calibrated with the pressure-dependent grain contact and the fraction of nonslipping grains as parameters. We demonstrated that the calibrated parameters can be correlated with the mechanical damage in the proppant pack. The characterization of mechanical damage in proppant packs can improve the design of the propping agents and quantification of proppant performance. Furthermore, the laboratory procedure can be extended to the use of borehole acoustic measurements in providing a real-time in-situ assessment of proppant performance. "

                    "abstract": "The reliability of core measurement and analysis is highly dependent on the measurement environment, rock quality, and the experimental procedures. Although core measurements are typically considered as ground truth for calibration and formation evaluation purposes, they do not necessarily represent the true rock properties, especially in complex formations such as organic-rich mudrocks. The uncertainty in core measurements can be caused by (but not limited to) significant changes of temperature, pressure, humidity, and other ambient conditions. Our previous experience showed that measurements of fluid volume in organic-rich mudrocks are significantly sensitive to relative humidity, which make these measurements highly variable. The impact of relative humidity on evaluation of water content in the laboratory condition has not been quantitatively investigated, which can cause significant errors in the outcomes of core analysis. This paper quantifies the influence of relative humidity on the hydration of clay minerals (i.e., montmorillonite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite) using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) methods. We also investigate the influence of clay hydration on the assessment of fluid volume in two organic-rich mudrock samples. We performed NMR laboratory measurements on pure clay mineral and organic-rich mudrock samples, kept under controlled humidity levels. We first started with clay samples, which were dried in an oven at 95°C. The NMR magnetic decay measurements in this samples showed existence of water. The TGA of clay minerals confirmed the same weight loss between 95°C and dehydroxylation temperature. This recorded water volume corresponded to desorption of water molecules directly bounded to exchangeable cations (i.e., exchangeable-cation bound water). NMR measurements and TGA provided similar volumes of exchangeable-cation bound water in the pure clay minerals. We also estimated the volume of hydration water in all the clay mineral samples. Water vapor adsorption experiments showed that the volume of water accumulated on the surface of clay minerals increased significantly as the relative humidity increased. Montmorillonite was affected by humidity more than other clay minerals. Finally, we estimated the thickness of exchangeable-cation bound water and hydration water on the surface of clay minerals using additional inputs from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis. In the case of organic-rich mudrocks, water vapor adsorption experiments showed more than 250% change in water volume when relative humidity varies in the range of 0% to 95%, which further verified the significant impact of humidity on core measurements and the necessity of applying corrections for such an impact.

                    "abstract": "Electrically conductive components other than saline water in organic-rich mudrocks present challenges when interpreting electrical resistivity logs. These components include clay minerals, pyrite, and thermally matured kerogen. As kerogen matures, hydrocarbon is generated and kerogen is chemically altered. This chemical alteration leads to increases in aromaticity of kerogen, which can be the reason for unexpectedly low resistivity in highly-matured organic-rich mudrocks and thus, underestimation of hydrocarbon reserves. Previous studies have investigated the chemical structure of kerogen over a wide range of thermal maturity and demonstrated the increase in aromaticity of organic matter as it matures. However, the connection among thermal maturity, aromaticity, and electrical conductivity in isolated kerogen and kerogen-bearing mudrocks has yet to be quantified and analyzed simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to quantify the impact of thermal maturity on (a) aromaticity in isolated kerogen and (b) electrical resistivity of organic-rich mudrocks and kerogen isolated from such rocks. To pursue this objective, we first isolate kerogen from organic-rich mudrocks. We then synthetically mature the samples and experimentally quantify the changes in their chemical structure and electrical conductivity. The experimental method employs Rock-Eval pyrolysis, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and electrical resistivity measurements, which were applied on organic-rich mudrock and isolated kerogen samples from four formations. The samples collected from these formations represent a wide range of thermal maturity of kerogen. In addition to performing experiments on naturally matured samples, we also evaluate samples undergone synthetic maturation. The results demonstrate significant increases in aromaticity of kerogen through natural and synthetic maturation. Through natural maturation, as hydrogen index (HI) decreased from 603 to 36 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon, aromaticity of kerogen increased from 0.40 to 0.95. We observed significant increases in electrical conductivity of heat-treated mudrock and isolated kerogen samples. In the case of isolated kerogen samples, their conductivity increased three to seven orders of magnitude when heat-treated from 150°C to 650°C. The experimental results documented in this paper contribute to a better understanding of the chemical and electrical properties of organic-rich mudrocks and its embedded kerogen as a function of thermal maturity. This is the first time that these properties are quantified simultaneously in isolated kerogen samples at increasing natural and synthetic thermal maturation levels. These results can potentially contribute to the development of dependable well-log-based petrophysical evaluation in organic-rich mudrocks, such as development of models to improve the interpretation of electrical resistivity measurements for reliable assessment of in-situ hydrocarbon saturation.

                    "abstract": "Formation evaluation and production design is often challenging in organic-rich mudrocks due to complexities in petrophysical and compositional properties, and post-depositional hydrocarbon generating mechanisms such as thermal maturation over time. Petrophysical parameters such as porosity, permeability and fluid saturations are important, but not sufficient to fully characterize organic-rich mudrocks. Integration of petrophysical, geochemical and geomechanical data is therefore required for a reliable rock classification in source rocks. This paper focuses on integrated rock classification in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, consisting of organic-rich fossiliferous marine shale deposited in Late Cretaceous. We first performed joint inversion of triple-combo, spectral gamma ray and elemental capture spectroscopy (ECS) logs to estimate depth-by-depth volumetric concentration of minerals, porosity, and fluid saturations. In the absence of acoustic measurements, concentrations and shape (i.e., aspect ratio) of minerals were used as inputs to the Self-consistent Approximation (SCA) model, to estimate depth-by-depth effective elastic properties such as Young's Modulus (YM) and Poisson's Ratio (PR). We then classified the rocks based on geologic texture and geochemical properties, as well as well-log based estimates of petrophysical and geomechanical parameters. We successfully applied a well-log based rock classification to two wells located in the oil window of Eagle Ford formation. Well no. 1 produced an additional 20% of hydrocarbons in the first 90-day of its production. Through the analysis of the results, we observed similar petrophysical properties and organic content of the reservoir quality classes in both wells. However, we noticed differences in estimates of elastic parameters such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio between the two wells. For the interbedded wackestone-limestone facies, YM average estimate in well no. 1 was approximately 10% higher than well no. 2, which can be the reason for the difference in their production. "

                    "abstract": "Reliable estimation of kerogen density is a requirement for dependable well-log-based petrophysical evaluation of organic-rich mudrocks. Assessment of kerogen density is, however, challenging with either well logs or laboratory measurements. As kerogen matures, hydrocarbons are generated and the chemical structure of kerogen is transformed, which can lead to measureable variations in kerogen density. Uncertainty in estimates of kerogen density can significantly impact the reliability of well-log interpretation results. Although previously developed techniques have quantified kerogen density using interpretation of well logs and/or core measurements, the connection between density and thermal maturity in kerogen isolated from a variety of organic-rich mudrocks has yet to be quantified. The objectives of this research are (a) to experimentally quantify the density of kerogen isolated from a variety of organic-rich mudrocks with different origins and (b) to investigate the impact of thermal maturity on kerogen density. We also evaluate the validity of results obtained under synthetic maturation as compared to natural maturation. To pursue these objectives, we use organic-rich mudrock samples from four formations, to cover a wide range in kerogen thermal maturity. We first isolate kerogen from these mudrock samples. Kerogen isolation enables reliable measurements of kerogen density under controlled thermal maturation levels. We then synthetically mature select isolated kerogen samples. Next, we estimate the density of all naturally and synthetically matured isolated kerogen samples. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the density of pure kerogen is experimentally quantified in such a wide range of thermal maturity (i.e., 36 to 603 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon in hydrogen index). The experimental results indicated that the density of kerogen can vary significantly among organic-rich mudrocks with different origins. We recorded densities ranging from 1.20 to 1.78 g/cm3 in kerogen samples when hydrogen index varied from 603 to 48 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. We also observed that kerogen density increases as a function of thermal maturity. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the measurable impact of kerogen density on estimates of petrophysical properties, such as porosity and water saturation in organic-rich mudrocks. The documented experimental results and procedures can be used to enhance petrophysical evaluation of organic-rich mudrocks, by taking into account the impact of kerogen thermal maturity in the models used for interpretation of core or well-log measurements.

                    "abstract": "Reliable evaluation of elastic properties is challenging in mudrocks, yet required for geomechanical modelling and successful fracture treatment. It is important to assimilate variable elastic properties and distribution of each matrix component, as well as rock fabric in evaluation of effective elastic properties of organic-rich mudrocks. Although existing methods (e.g., effective medium theories) for well-log-based assessment of elastic properties take into account stiffness and approximate shape of the rock components, they all assume that elastic properties of each rock component remain constant. However, these properties might vary depending on the distribution and size of that particular component, as well as its adjacent minerals. Furthermore, there is a significant uncertainty in elastic properties of kerogen. The uncertainty associated with the aforementioned parameters on effective elastic properties of rocks has not been investigated in previous publications. In this paper, we quantify the uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties in mudrocks, by quantifying the variability in elastic properties of individual rock components caused by their spatial distribution, size, and rock fabric, at the micro-scale domain. We performed nanoindentation mechanical tests at identified locations on samples from the Haynesville and lower Eagle Ford formations, to measure Young's modulus of individual and mixtures of rock components. Finally, we quantified the variability of Young's modulus in the micro-scale domain and their impact on effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and well-log domains in organic-rich mudrocks. The uncertainties involved in the evaluation of effective elastic properties of the samples are quantified by taking into account the measured variability in elastic properties of each individual component. The estimated effective elastic properties are then compared against core-scale measurements of elastic properties, previously obtained via tri-axial mechanical tests. The results revealed significant uncertainties in measurements of elastic properties of soft rock components, such as clay minerals and kerogen. Young's moduli of individual clay components when located adjacent to stiff rock components (e.g. large quartz and calcite grains) are at least 15% higher, compared to the cases where they are located adjacent to other clay minerals. The uncertainty in measured Young's moduli is smaller in the case of non-clay minerals. Elastic properties of kerogen are also quantified, and the measured average variability in kerogen Young's modulus is estimated to be 10%. The results showed that the impact of variabilities in individual elastic properties of rock components on estimates of effective elastic properties at the micro-scale and log-scale domains is less than 5%. We also estimated an average relative difference of less than 25% between estimates of effective vertical Young's modulus estimated using the inputs from nanoindentation tests and vertical Young's modulus measured from core samples.

                    "abstract": "In-situ assessment of permeability has been a challenge in anisotropic carbonate formations with complex pore structure. Permeability is controlled by the conducting pore network, which is the portion of the interconnected pore volume that actively contributes to fluid and electric current flow. Well-log-based assessment of conducting porosity is, however, challenging. Conventional methods for permeability assessment use well-log-derived or core-derived estimates of porosity for permeability assessment. However, these estimates of porosity do not necessarily represent the anisotropic conducting pore volume. Consequently, conventional well-log-based methods are often not reliable in quantifying anisotropic permeability. Conventional permeability assessment techniques quantify the connected porosity using estimates of acoustic or non-shale porosity. These estimates of porosity do not represent the conducting porosity because they do not account for stagnant pore network. They also do not assimilate the directional pore-network connectivity, which makes them inapplicable for directional permeability assessment. This paper introduces a new method for quantifying the directional conducting pore network volume fraction and directional permeability in heterogeneous carbonate formations. The first step includes analysis of three-dimensional pore-scale images of rock samples obtained from high-resolution Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) scanner. We perform pore-scale simulations of electrical current flow to estimate the directional tortuosity of the pore network and effective electrical resistivity of the pore-scale images. We then use the effective electrical resistivity and tortuosity tensors to develop pore-scale models of directional conducting pore network volume fraction in each rock class. Subsequently, we use the Lattice Boltzmann method to simulate directional fluid flow and develop pore-scale directional permeability models for each rock class. Finally, we apply the introduced pore-scale-derived directional permeability models in each rock type for depth-by-depth assessment of directional permeability in the formation using well logs. We applied the introduced method to pore-scale images from seven formations as well as to pore- and log-scale data from a carbonate formation to estimate conducting pore volume and permeability. The results showed that the estimated conducting porosity can be more than 40% less than the interconnected porosity. We also quantified the conducting pore volume fraction in different directions in anisotropic rock types with complex pore structures and observed up to a 42% relative variation of conducting pore volume fraction in different directions. We compared the estimates of permeability to the results obtained from core measurements and conventional methods in one of the carbonate examples. The new method led to 45% reduction in relative error of permeability estimates compared to conventional permeability models. "

                    "abstract": "Reliable evaluation of proppant placement in hydraulic fractures is challenging because there are environmental and regulatory concerns about existing techniques which use radioactive tracers. Recent research investigations have shown the potential for the application of nanoparticles as contrast agents for reservoir characterization and advanced reservoir surveillance. This paper demonstrates a new technique for using nanoparticles as contrast agents mixed with proppants that can enhance borehole geophysical measurements, such as magnetic susceptibility, thereby improving the near-wellbore detection of proppants in hydraulic fractures. The methods used in this paper include both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The experimental approach consists of (a) synthesizing paramagnetic nanoparticles and (b) carrying out a series of magnetic susceptibility core logging measurements, in the presence of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles (i.e., with a core/shell structure with size of 60–70 nm) mixed with proppants. Numerical simulations are performed simultaneously to confirm that the nanoparticles remain concentrated in hydraulic fractures as is demonstrated in the experimental work. We developed a two-phase flow model to investigate the spatial distribution of nanoparticles when they are injected into a hydraulically fractured porous media, in which the hydraulic fractures are filled with propping agents. Furthermore, we used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of heterogeneity as well as rock and fracture properties on spatial distribution of nanoparticles in the porous media. The results of laboratory experiments showed that the relative enhancement of the volume susceptibility of the fractured zones depend on factors such as the type of proppants (e.g., magnetic versus non-magnetic proppants), the concentration of nanoparticles in the injected solution, and the volume of nanoparticle solution and proppants. The use of magnetic nanoparticles lead to a significant enhancement in the detection of fractures, even with widths as small as 0.3 cm. The numerical simulations on synthetic examples show that the nanoparticle concentration in hydraulic fractures is significantly higher than that in the surrounding porous rock in the case of tight formations. We have then illustrated from the experimental and numerical methods that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which are mainly concentrated in the fractures can be used as contrast agents mixed with the proppants to highlight the fractures and detect the location of proppants. This detection technique can be applied in the field by using the borehole magnetic susceptibility tools for pre-fracturing and post-fracturing measurements in open-hole wells. "

                    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method for directional-permeability assessment with nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements. Conventional techniques for permeability assessment from NMR measurements include empirical correlations such as SDR (Schlumberger-Doll-Research) and Coates models. However, carbonate rocks are known for lack of good correlations between pore-body-size and pore-throat-size, which makes it challenging and often unreliable to estimate permeability from NMR T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) distribution in carbonate formations with complex pore structure. It also was proposed that conventional permeability models can be improved by incorporating an estimated pore-connectivity factor. However, none of the previously introduced techniques reflects the anisotropic characteristics of rock permeability. The new NMR-based directional-permeability model, introduced in this paper, incorporates a directional pore-connectivity factor into a conventional NMR-based permeability model. We introduce two approaches to quantify the directional pore-network connectivity of rock samples with pore-scale images. The first approach calculates directional pore connectivity in 3D pore-scale images with a topological technique. The second approach combines image analysis and electrical formation factor. The new NMR-based permeability model enables assessment of rock permeability in any desired direction. We successfully calibrated and tested the introduced NMR-based permeability model on carbonate, sandstone, and sandpack samples with complex pore geometry or anisotropic permeability. The anisotropic permeability used for calibration and test purposes was obtained by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) simulations on microcomputed tomography (CT) images of rock samples. The comparison between the permeability estimates with our new NMR model and conventional NMR models (e.g., SDR and Coates models) demonstrated that the NMR-based directional-permeability model significantly improves assessment of rock permeability, by reflecting rock’s anisotropic characteristics and minimizing calibration efforts. The outcomes of this research can significantly improve permeability assessment in complex carbonate reservoirs and anisotropic sandstone reservoirs, and can be extended further to organic-rich mudrock formations.

                    "abstract": "Restoring formation damage by matrix acidizing is one of the common ways to increase productivity in sandstone formations. While sandstone formations are typically composed of the same types of minerals, the concentration and composition of these minerals, as well as the permeability and porosity of the matrix, can vary widely. Such variable petrophysical and compositional properties of sandstone formations can affect the severity of fines migration and the performance of acid stimulation treatments. To evaluate the effect of acid stimulation on petrophysical properties before and after fines migration, coreflood experiments were conducted on Bandera sandstone cores. Half of the treatments were conducted on cores that were damaged by triggering fines migration by injecting deionized water, and the other half were conducted on undamaged cores. These cores contain a wide range of clay content, mineral compositions, permeability, pore size distribution, and porosity. A series of characterizing tests and measurements were performed before and after acid treatments. The objectives of this work include: (a) analyzing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements to determine the mineralogy and elemental composition of the rocks, (b) interpreting computational tomography (CT) scans to evaluate pore-scale heterogeneity and acid effect on cementing material, and (c) evaluating permeability by flooding the core samples with brine. More than 20 coreflood experiments were conducted at constant temperatures of 72, 150, and 250°F and constant acid concentration on 6 in. x 1.5 in. core samples at different injection rates. The CT- scans proved, quantified, and localized the fines migration in the damaged cores. The effect of fines migration on the acid stimulation treatment success in terms of increasing permeability and ultimately productivity was determined. Additionally, acid reaction increases porosity and permeability. However, treatment of damaged cores yielded different pore-size distribution and permeability compared to undamaged cores. Furthermore, combining CT-scan and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results proved an extremely high sensitivity of fines migration toward HCl at temperatures 150 and 250°F resulted in porosity deterioration toward the outlet compared to the gained porosity at the inlet of the treated cores. The literature is rich with discussions about sandstone acidizing and acid systems. However, this comparative study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of fines migration on the success of the stimulation treatment and its effect on petrophysical properties. The outcome of this work will lead to a reliable design of matrix acid treatments and, hence, increase the chances of successful acid stimulation treatment that optimizes well productivity. "

                    "abstract": "Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) measurements are considered among the most-reliable methods to evaluate porosity and pore-size distribution in fluid-bearing rocks. However, in reservoirs with complex pore geometry, there is still a challenge to interpret accurately NMR relaxometry data to evaluate petrophysical properties of these reservoirs such as interconnected porosity. In this paper, we introduce the application of nanoparticle contrast agents to improve assessment of interconnected porosity with NMR measurements. The comparison of NMR relaxometry data before and after nanoparticle injection enables distinguishing connected and isolated pore volumes (PVs), which might not be possible in the absence of contrast agents. The use of these contrast agents was demonstrated successfully in the magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) technique for clinical diagnosis. We used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) as contrast agents injected into rock samples with a multiple-porosity system (including intra-/intergranular pores and natural fractures) and then quantified their impact on NMR measurements with laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. We injected contrast agents in sandstone and organic-rich mudrock samples, and measured NMR T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) distributions before and after contrast-agent injection. We simulated the NMR responses in sandstone and organic-rich mudrock samples before and after injection of contrast agent with a random walk algorithm. The simulated NMR T2 distribution was cross validated by experimental results. We also documented the simulation results in a carbonates sample before and after injection of contrast agents, and characterized the pore-network connectivity with the simulation T2 distribution. The results show that the comparison of NMR relaxometry data before and after SPION injection improves characterization of interconnected porosity and connectivity of natural fractures in rock samples with complex pore geometry such as those from carbonate and organic-rich mudrock formations. We observed that the long-relaxation-time peaks in NMR T2 distribution significantly shift to short relaxation time after SPION injection, indicating that interconnected large pores/fractures are most easily invaded by SPION. However, the original short-relaxation-time peaks remained at the same position with almost the same amplitude and shape, indicating that small pores are not invaded by SPION. The accumulative porosity of the rock remains almost the same before and after SPION injection, indicating that SPION invasion in the rock only results in the downshifting of T2 relaxation time, but does not affect the NMR estimates of total porosity. We conclude from the experimental and numerical-simulation results that interconnected large pores/fractures, isolated large pores, and small pores can be differentiated in NMR T2 distribution with the aid of contrast agents. The outcomes of this paper are promising for the successful application of the introduced technique for pore characterization in heterogeneous multiple-porosity systems containing natural fractures.

However, the uncertainty associated with these estimates can be significant in complex heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs, such as those with variable pore size and pore network connectivity. In such cases, distinguishing isolated pore space is often impossible using well-log measurements and conventional well-log interpretation methods, which makes permeability evaluation unreliable. This paper proposes a new application of the NMR log-inject-log method to improve assessment of permeability and to distinguish isolated pores from connected pores. We propose injecting manganese-bearing solution in the rock samples and simultaneously analyze NMR measurements before and after injection of the contrast solution. We introduced a method to eliminate the impact of isolated pore space from the NMR T2 distribution, which is then used for improved permeability assessment. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for field applications, we conducted NMR laboratory measurements in two carbonate rock types. We injected manganese-bearing solution into rock samples using a coreflood experimental procedure and measured NMR T2 distributions before and after injection. We then estimated isolated porosity and interconnected porosity by taking into account the difference between the NMR T2 distributions acquired before and after the injection of the contrast solution. We introduced a method to calculate geometric mean of T2 distribution for interconnected pores, and also to obtain effective free fluid volume and bound fluid volume. Finally, we used the T2 distribution corrected for the impact of isolated pores in conventional NMR-based permeability models to improve permeability assessment. We cross-validated the NMR-based permeability estimates against Kinkenberg permeability measured by an unsteady-state gas permeameter. The results confirmed that the proposed method enables quantifying the isolated and connected pore volume, and finally improves NMR-based permeability assessment. The new method provided estimates of permeability with approximately 10% average error in eight carbonate rock samples, which was a significant improvement compared to the errors observed before correcting T2 distribution for the impact of isolated pores.

A reliable numerical simulation of NMR response in these rocks helps in better understanding of the NMR relaxometry data and the corresponding petrophysical properties (e.g., the wettability and fluid distribution in the pore space). The hydrocarbon-wetting or mixed-wetting characteristics of organic-rich mudrocks have significant impacts on hydrocarbon recovery from the rocks, but quantification of wettability using conventional well-log interpretation methods remains a conundrum. The objectives of this paper are (a) to introduce a NMR two-phase simulation method to model the NMR responses in organic-rich mudrocks and (b) to investigate the effects of wettability alteration and fluid distribution on NMR relaxometry using numerical simulations. We simultaneously simulate the NMR responses from both water and hydrocarbon phases in organic-rich mudrocks using a random-walk algorithm. The main input to this two-phase NMR simulator is a digital rock matrix reconstructed from 3D pore-scale images of organic-rich mudrock samples, including water, inorganic grains, hydrocarbon, and kerogen. The pore-scale digital images are obtained from FIB-SEM (Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope) images. The output of the NMR simulator is the NMR transverse magnetization decay in the rock matrix. The NMR T2 distribution is estimated by inversion of the simulated magnetization decay using a curvature smoothing method. We also separate the individual T2 distribution peaks from different pores and compare them against the combined T2 distribution to demonstrate the reliability of the simulation results. We successfully simulated NMR T2 distribution in synthetic and actual organic-rich mudrock samples. We also showed that the alteration of wettability and fluid distribution within the organic-rich mudrock matrix have a measurable impact on NMR T2 distribution. The introduced simulation method enables further developments on interpretation of NMR measurements in organic-rich mudrocks, which has been challenging in laboratory experiments. The outcomes of this paper can improve the understanding of the parameters affecting NMR relaxometry in organic-rich mudrocks. They also potentially enhance the interpretation of NMR borehole measurements for real-time assessment of porosity, pore-size distribution, and wettability. "

NMR T2 (spin-spin relaxation time) distribution has been conventionally considered insensitive to the presence of micro-fractures. In a recent publication (Chi and Heidari, 2015), we demonstrated that NMR relaxometry can be influenced by the presence of micro-fractures and a phenomena named fracture-pore diffusional coupling. If the diffusional coupling effect is not taken into account in the interpretation of NMR measurements, the T2 relaxation times of intergranular pores or micro-fractures can be underestimated by up to 29%, which causes underestimation of pore size, or micro-fracture aperture, by NMR measurements. Consequently, the distortion of T2 distribution can influence NMR-based permeability assessment. However, the impact of fracture-pore diffusional coupling on NMR-based permeability estimates has not yet been investigated. The objectives of this paper are (a) to quantify the impact of micro-fractures and fracture-pore coupling on NMRbased permeability estimates and (b) to evaluate the reliability of conventional NMR permeability models (e.g., the Schlumberger Doll Research (SDR) and Coates models) and a new NMR directional permeability model in fractured formations. We compared the estimated permeability of fractured carbonate rock samples using different NMR permeability models. Results show that the fracture-pore coupling in multiple-porosity systems may cause underestimation or overestimation of permeability when using the Coates model, which relies on differentiation of movable fluids and irreducible fluids. This underestimation or overestimation is influenced by aperture of micro-fractures. However, when using NMR permeability models relying on geometric mean of T2 distribution (T2GM), such as the SDR model and the recently introduced NMR directional permeability model, the influence of fracture-pore diffusional coupling can be negligible. We observed that in multiple-porosity systems where fracture-pore diffusional coupling is significant, the SDR and NMR directional permeability models are more reliable than the Coates model. The outcomes of this paper enable improved permeability assessment in formations with complex pore structure, such as fractured carbonate and organic-rich mudrock formations. "

However, the evaluation of rock mechanical properties in these formations is challenging because of their heterogeneity, anisotropy, and complex lithology. Hence, geomechanical analysis should include a complete definition of the anisotropic elastic stiffness coefficients for stress prediction. Furthermore, typical assumptions made for poroelastic parameters (e.g., Biot’s coefficient equal to one) can result in unreliable geomechanical evaluation for stress prediction. Unreliable stress prediction can further lead to unexpected fracture propagation, failure in proppant placement, and, ultimately, unsuccessful selection of completion intervals. The objectives of this paper include (a) measuring anisotropic elastic properties and poroelastic parameters in organic-rich mudrocks and (b) predicting minimum horizontal stresses for organic-rich mudrocks, using laboratory measurements and well logs. We then investigate the impact of anisotropic elastic and poroelastic rock properties on stress prediction. We first perform triaxial stress and uniaxial strain mechanical tests on core plugs from the Haynesville, upper Wolfcamp and lower Eagle Ford shale formations. We obtained correlations between the dynamic and static elastic stiffness coefficients, based on laboratory experiments. We then used well logs to estimate the petrophysical/compositional properties as well as the dynamic elastic stiffness coefficients of the formations. The estimates of mineral composition are used in conjunction with the estimates of elastic stiffness coefficients to obtain anisotropic poroelastic parameters. Finally, stress prediction was performed under the assumption of transverse isotropy, which included the measured anisotropic elastic and poroelastic parameters. We evaluated the impact of anisotropic mechanical properties on stress prediction in the lower Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and upper Wolfcamp shale formations, with different levels of mechanical anisotropy and vertical heterogeneity. The results show that Biot’s coefficient of poroelasticity is not equal to one. Therefore, depth-bydepth estimation of anisotropic poroelastic coefficients are required for transversely isotropic media for accurate stress prediction. The estimated minimum horizontal stress gradient assuming anisotropic elastic properties and anisotropic poroelastic parameters, varies by about 40% compared to the case where these parameters are assumed to be equal to one. We also showed that integrated interpretation of petrophysical, compositional, and mechanical properties is important for geomechanical evaluation in organic-rich mudrocks. "

                    "abstract": "Currently, the application of nanoparticles has attracted much attention due to the potential of nanotechnology to lead to revolutionary changes in the petroleum industry. The literature contains numerous references to the possible use of this technology for enhanced oil recovery, nano-scale sensors and subsurface mapping. Little work has been conducted to establish numerical models to investigate nanoparticle transport in reservoirs, and even less for shale reservoirs. Unlike conventional reservoirs, shale formations usually contain four pore systems: inorganic matter, organic matter dominated by hydrocarbon wettability, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. Concurrently, hydraulic fractures and the associated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) from induced fractures play a critical role in significantly increasing well productivity. In this paper, a mathematical model for simulating nanoparticle transport in shale reservoirs was developed. The simulator includes contributions from Darcy flow, Brownian diffusion, gas diffusion and desorption, slippage flow, and capillary effects based on the extremely low permeability and micro- to nano-scale of the pores. Moreover, these diverse mechanisms are separately applied to different portions of the reservoir due to the variation in media properties. Applications of the model include numerical examples from two-dimensional micro models to macro models, both with organic matter randomly distributed within the inorganic matrix. The effects of varying water saturation, grid pressure, and mass concentration of nanoparticles are shown graphically in these numerical examples. The main conclusion from these models is that, as expected, nanoparticles can only easily flow along with the aqueous phase into the fractures, but their transport into the shale matrix is quite limited, with little transport shown into the organic matter. In addition, based on the measured properties of synthesized magnetic carbon-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles, the distribution of the volumetric magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization of reservoir including SRV are simulated and displayed in the numerical cases with and without magnetic nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that magnetic nanoparticles can effectively enlarge the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization of reservoir thus producing enhanced signals from well logging devices such as Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and leading to improved reservoir and fracture characterization. This simulator can provide the benefits of both numerically simulating the transport and distribution of nanoparticles in hydraulically fractured shale formations and supplying helpful guidelines for nanoparticles injection plans to enhance well logging signals. Furthermore, this model can also allow us to mimic the tracer transport flow in unconventional reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Acid etching, as the consequence of heterogeneous distribution of petrophysical and compositional properties, results in the conductivity of acid fractures in carbonate reservoirs. Reliable characterization of small-scale formation spatial heterogeneity by use of geostatistical analysis (i.e., variogram analysis) can improve prediction of acid-fracture conductivity significantly. Previous publications suggest that permeability correlation length can be used to assimilate spatial heterogeneity in prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. Well logs are good candidates to provide information about petrophysical and compositional properties of the formation with the required resolution for prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. However, the assessment of permeability and mineralogy from conventional well logs is challenging because of high spatial heterogeneity and complex pore structure. Rock typing has been suggested in the literature to improve permeability assessment in carbonates. Most of the previously introduced rock-typing methods are dependent on core measurements. However, core data are generally sparse and not available with the sampling rate required for prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. The main objective of this paper is to quantify formation spatial heterogeneity with variogram analysis of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties in carbonate reservoirs. We introduce an iterative permeability-assessment technique that is based on well logs, which takes into account characteristics of different rock classes in the reservoir. Furthermore, we propose three rock-classification techniques that are based on conventional well logs and that take into account static and dynamic petrophysical properties of the formation as well as mineral composition. We applied the proposed techniques successfully in two carbonate formations--Happy Spraberry oil field and Hugoton gas field. The petrophysical rock classification is in good agreement with identified core-derived rock classes. The results show approximately 54% improvement in permeability assessment compared with conventional permeability-assessment techniques, which can improve prediction of acid-stimulation jobs significantly. Finally, we investigated the direct application of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties for variogram analysis required to characterize formation spatial heterogeneity. We conducted variogram analysis in both field examples. The results show that the direct application of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical/compositional properties is reliable to characterize formation spatial heterogeneity. We also showed that application of well logs can enhance assessment of spatial heterogeneity compared with core measurements. "

                    "abstract": "Reliable detection of propping agents in fractures has been a challenge for the petroleum Industry. Researchers are currently investigating the application of nanoparticles as contrast agents for reservoir characterization and advanced reservoir surveillance. This paper demonstrates the use of nanoparticles as contrast agents mixed with proppants that can enhance signals from borehole geophysical measurements, thereby improving the detection of proppants in hydraulic fractures. The methods used in this paper study include both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The experimental approach consists of (a) synthesizing paramagnetic nanoparticles and (b) carrying out a series of magnetic susceptibility core logging measurements, using the superparamagnetic nanoparticles mixed withy proppants. Numerical simulations are performed simultaneously to show that the distribution of nanoparticles remain concentrated in hydraulic fractures as is demonstrated in our experimental work. We developed a two-phase flow model to investigate the spatial distribution of nanoparticles when they are injected into a hydraulically fractured porous media, in which the hydraulic fractures are filled with propping agents. Furthermore, we used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of heterogeneity as well as rock and fracture properties on spatial distribution on nanoparticles in the porous media. We successfully synthesized paramagnetic nanoparticles with a core/shell structure with size of 60 nm–70 nm. The hysteresis loops obtained from the magnetic measurements demonstrate magnetic stability of the nanoparticles at both surface and reservoir temperatures. The magnetic nanoparticles provided high sensitivity when used as contrast agents in magnetic susceptibility measurements of carbonate and organic shale samples.  The relative enhancement of the volume susceptibility depends on the minerals present within the formation, concentration of the nanoparticle solution, and the magnetic composition of the proppants. The results of the numerical simulations confirmed the effectiveness of using nanoparticles as contrast agents in highlight fractures and, hence, the location of the proppants. We have demonstrated in the synthetic examples that the nanoparticle concentration in hydraulic fractures is significantly higher than that in the surrounding porous rock in the case of low permeability formations, suggesting that hydraulic fractures can be clearly differentiated from the surrounding formations. We have thus illustrated from the experimental and numerical methods that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles which are mainly concentrated in the fractures can be used as contrast agents mixed with the proppants to highlight the fractures and detect the location of proppants. The prospect of injecting magnetic nanoparticles as contrasting agents along with propping agents during fracture treatment is promising for the accurate monitoring and tracking of propping agent. More developments on this approach will lead to improvement in the determination of the hydraulic-fracture geometry, which is of great value in designing hydraulic fracture treatments. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture detection and characterization are challenging aspects of completion plans for unconventional tight carbonate and shale reservoirs. Current industry methods, such as high resolution resistivity imaging, mitigate uncertainties in fracture characterization, but are not cost effective or always available. Conventional well logs (e.g., induction logs) can be better solutions for the industry for reliable fracture characterization. However, these measurements do not provide significant sensitivity to fracture location and geometry. An improved evaluation of thickness and near-wellbore geometry of induced fractures using conventional well logging tools could significantly enhance operational decisions and increase production during field development. We propose the use of surface gas readings and downhole measurements in combination with numerical simulations of electromagnetic induction log responses to define and high-grade natural fracture corridors. We performed numerical simulations to model the effects of hydraulic fractures on induction log response, within the fractured zones. These simulations consisted of placing resistive fractures, with variable parameters, inside a layered formation, and modeling the apparent resistivity using an induction logging simulator. The fractured zones were represented using a geologic roughening parameter, β, while the simulator is based on the finite element method. The simulator, Seatem, solves the diffusive Maxwell equations, and plots the resulting apparent resistivity distributions within an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. This provides us with a good understanding of how the targeted zone interacts with different stimulation factors. We successfully performed numerical simulations along a multi-zoned reservoir interval for three synthetic cases: a sandstone formation, a carbonate formation, and an organic shale formation. We quantified the effects of hydraulic fracturing on induction logs and optimized placement of fracture treatments on synthetic cases. The results of this paper indicate fractured zones with beta values larger than 0.3, viable for fracture corridor depletion and geologic targeting, can be identified from induction log responses. Introduction Unconventional reservoirs hold significant hydrocarbon reserves that are often unobtainable through classical production techniques. These types of formations contain unique geological properties that require enhanced recovery methods to make their production economically feasible. The standard method of producing these reservoirs involves stimulation of the rock matrix through various fracturing techniques. Although individual wells in unconventional formations have a relatively low cost for drilling and completions, they typically have a budget that limits the operator’s ability to analyze sufficiently crucial geomechanical parameters, such as natural fracture density. Even in the best cases, uncertainty in subsurface characterization is still prevalent among unconventional reservoirs. In larger investment wells, specialized techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance, high-definition resistivity imaging, and production logs may solve many of these characterization issues. However, in unconventional plays, the operator is often forced to rely on basic geomechanical and well logging methods to extract fracture attributes. "

Core measurements, on the other hand, are usually sparse and do not provide real-time and in-situ depth-by-depth petrophysical characterization. Several studies focus on improvements in workflows for core measurements and well-log interpretation methods. However, we approach this challenge by introducing a method to enhance the sensitivity of well logs to petrophysical properties of the formation and to the presence of natural fractures using nanoparticles as contrast agents that can travel into the rock. We quantify the effect of petrophysical properties of porous media on the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles injected as contrasting agents to the formation. We achieved this goal by developing a two-phase fluid-flow numerical simulator for transport of injected nanoparticles in fractured porous media and synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles and characterizing their properties. The developed simulator takes into account the deposition/adsorption of nanoparticles based on colloid filtration theory and Brownian diffusion. We documented the results of numerical simulations for homogenous and heterogeneous naturally fractured porous media. The effluent history from the coreflood of sandstone with the synthesized nanoparticle solution confirms the results from numerical simulations. We showed that the nanoparticles are mostly concentrated in the connected natural fractures when the permeability of matrix is significantly lower than that of fractures. The sensitivity analysis shows negligible impact of nanoparticle size on spatial distribution of nanoparticles because of the dominance of dispersion over diffusion effects. The results are promising for measureable impact of nanoparticles on specific borehole geophysical measurements to better characterize naturally fractured rocks. "

Conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models (e.g., Archie, dual-water, and Waxman-Smits) assume that the pore water is the only conductive part of the formation. However, this assumption is not reliable in the presence of the thermally mature organic matter, clay, and pyrite found in many source rocks. Previous experimental studies indicate that as the aromaticity of kerogen increases with increasing thermal maturity, the conductive behavior of kerogen is also affected. In this paper, we investigated the effect of conductive kerogen on the resistivity of mature source rocks. We investigated the reliability of conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models for estimating fluid saturation in organic-rich mudrocks, using well logs and core measurements from the Haynesville Shale. We then numerically simulated the electric field, electric currents, and effective resistivity of synthetic pore-scale rock images. Finally, we used numerical simulation to quantify the effects of the (a) volumetric concentration of kerogen, (b) kerogen conductivity, and (c) spatial connectivity of the kerogen-water network on the resistivity of organic-rich mudrocks. Well-log interpretation of the Haynesville Shale showed that conventional resistivity-porosity-saturation models underestimate hydrocarbon saturation in zones with high concentrations of kerogen. In this paper, we show that errors in the estimation of of hydrocarbon saturation could be due to the effect of kerogen on resistivity measurements. Our pore-scale numerical simulations show that there is a 10 to 23% improvement in hydrocarbon-saturation estimates, when the impact of conductive kerogen is taken into account. Results of this work can be used as a first step towards improving conventional resistivity-porositysaturation models for the assessment of fluid saturations in organic-rich mudrocks. "

In extreme cases, conventional rock typing methods such as Leverett's J-function, Winland's R35, and flow zone indicator are inadequate to capture the heterogeneity and complexity of carbonate petrofacies. Furthermore, these methods are based on core measurements, hence are not applicable to uncored reservoir zones. This paper introduces a new method for petrophysical rock classification in carbonate reservoirs that honors multiple well logs and emphasizes the signature of mud-filtrate invasion. The method classifies rocks based on both static and dynamic petrophysical properties. An inversion-based algorithm is implemented to simultaneously estimate mineralogy, porosity, and water saturation from well logs. We numerically simulate the process of mud-filtrate invasion in each rock type and quantify the corresponding effects on nuclear and resistivity measurements to derive invasion-induced well-log attributes, which are subsequently integrated into the rock classification. Under favorable conditions, the interpretation method advanced in this paper can distinguish bimodal from uni-modal behavior in saturation-dependent capillary pressure otherwise only possible with special core analysis. We successfully apply the new method to a mixed clastic-carbonate sequence in the Hugoton gas field, Kansas. Rock types derived with the new method are in good agreement with lithofacies described from core samples. The distribution of permeability and saturation estimated from well-log-derived rock types agrees with routine core measurements, with the corresponding uncertainty significantly reduced when compared to results obtained with conventional porosity-permeability correlations.

                    "abstract": "This paper introduces a rock typing method for application in hydrocarbon-bearing shale (specifically source rock) reservoirs using conventional well logs and core data. Source rock reservoirs are known to be highly heterogeneous and often require new or specialized petrophysical techniques for accurate reservoir evaluation. In the past, petrophysical description of source rock reservoirs with well logs has been focused to quantifying rock composition and organic-matter concentration. These solutions often require many assumptions and ad-hoc correlations where the interpretation becomes a core matching exercise. Scale effects on measurements are typically neglected in core matching. Rock typing in hydrocarbon-bearing shale provides an alternative description by segmenting the reservoir into petrophysically-similar groups with k-means cluster analysis, which can then be used for ranking and detailed analysis of depth zones favorable for production. A synthetic example illustrates the rock typing method for an idealized sequence of beds penetrated by a vertical well. Results and analysis from the synthetic example show that rock types from inverted log properties correctly identify the most organic-rich sections better than rock types detected from well logs in thin beds. Also, estimated kerogen concentration is shown to be the most reliable property in an under-determined inversion solution. Field cases in the Barnett and Haynesville shale gas plays show the importance of core data for supplementing well logs and identifying correlations for desirable reservoir properties (kerogen/TOC concentration, fluid saturations, and porosity). Qualitative rock classes are formed and verified using inverted estimates of kerogen concentration as a rock-quality metric. Inverted log properties identify 40% more of a high-kerogen rock type over well-log based rock types in the Barnett formation. A case in the Haynesville formation suggests the possibility of identifying depositional environments as a result of rock attributes that produce distinct groupings from k-means cluster analysis with well logs. Core data and inversion results indicate homogeneity in the Haynesville formation case. However, the distributions of rock types show a 50% occurrence between two rock types over 90 ft vertical-extent of reservoir. Rock types suggest vertical distributions that exhibit similar rock attributes with characteristic properties (porosity, organic concentration and maturity, and gas saturation). The interpretation method considered in this paper does not directly quantify reservoir parameters and would not serve the purpose of quantifying gas-in-place. Rock typing in hydrocarbon-bearing shale with conventional well logs forms qualitative rock classes which can be used to calculate net-to-gross, validate conventional interpretation methods, perform well-to-well correlations, and establish facies distributions for integrated reservoir modeling in hydrocarbon-bearing shale.  Introduction The composition of source rock reservoirs is known to be stratigraphically heterogeneous as a result of variable and complex rock components. These reservoirs are self-contained petroleum systems; they provide the source, seal, and reservoir for hydrocarbons. Petrophysical analyses are complicated by the finely dispersed assortment of unique solid and fluid constituents that result from the sourcing organic matter, locally-generated hydrocarbons, and depositionally low-energy detritus. Permeability is extremely low in source rock formations and the economic production of hydrocarbon is possible in large part by the advent of horizontal drilling and modern completions technologies. However, the identification of zones that are likely to provide the maximum output over the life of a well cannot be treated without due consideration. A comprehensive analysis of exploratory well logs is crucial to evaluate the potential of a well. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Estimation of residual hydrocarbon saturation remains an outstanding challenge in formation evaluation and core analysis. Standard interpretation methods for nuclear-resistivity logs cannot distinguish between mobile and residual hydrocarbon saturation. In extreme cases, fluid pump out or production testing are the only options to ascertain whether the reservoir’s in-situ hydrocarbon is mobile. We develop a new method to distinguish mobile from residual hydrocarbon and to quantify residual hydrocarbon saturation. The method combines modeling of resistivity and nuclear logs with the physics of mud-filtrate invasion to quantify the effect of residual hydrocarbon saturation on both nuclear and resistivity logs. This strategy explicitly takes into account the different volumes of investigation of resistivity and nuclear measurements and does not assume that the near-borehole region is flushed to the level of residual hydrocarbon saturation. The method begins with an initial multi-layer petro physical model which is constructed via standard procedures of well-log interpretation and core measurements. Thereafter, we simulate the physics of mud-filtrate invasion and the corresponding resistivity, density, and neutron logs. Initial estimates of residual hydrocarbon saturation and parametric relative permeability are refined until achieving a good agreement between simulated and measured neutron and density logs. Next, we refine initial estimates of water saturation, porosity, and permeability until securing a good match between numerically simulated and measured resistivity logs. The method of interpretation considers two specific options for implementation: (1) quantification of the influence of residual hydrocarbon saturation on the radial distribution of fluid saturation due to invasion, and (2) appraisal of invasion effects on the vertical distribution of fluid saturation within a flow unit that exhibits both hydrocarbon and water saturation in capillary equilibrium. Application examples are described for the cases of tight-gas sand reservoirs invaded with water-base mud (WBM) and oil-bearing reservoirs invaded with oil-base mud (OBM). In the case of tight-gas sands, our method explains the marginal productivity of deeply invaded beds that exhibit cross-over between density and neutron logs. For a 15-porosity unit formation, when the residual gas saturation increases by 10 saturation units, the cross-over between neutron and density logs increases by 2.4 porosity units. Interpretation results indicate measurable sensitivity of nuclear logs to residual hydrocarbon saturation in cases of deep WBM invasion due to immiscibility between invaded and in-situ fluids. However, the accuracy of the method decreases with increasing values of both hydrocarbon pore volume and hydrocarbon density. In the case of OBM invasion, reliable estimations of residual hydrocarbon saturation are possible with relative density differences above 15 per-cent between mud filtrate and in-situ hydrocarbon. "

                    "abstract": "Several tools and techniques exist to understand distributions of reservoir properties. Interwell tracer testing is one of the most common methods to obtain reservoir information from the amount of tracer produced. The capacitance/resistance model (CRM) is an analytical tool to estimate connectivity between producer/injector pairs from historical rates and, when available, bottomhole-pressure data in waterfloods. Because the CRM is a physically based, simple input/output model, its combination with tracer testing can provide insight into reservoir features. To enable the CRM application to tracer flow, we incorporated tracer models, based on miscible-displacement theory, into the CRM. Reservoir properties are estimated as a result of the model fitting to produced-tracer data. In this paper, we present three tracer models: a dispersion-only (short-range autocorrelation) model, a Koval (long-range) model, and a combination of the two. To incorporate the tracer models into the CRM, we used two methods, serial fitting (CRM then tracers) and simultaneous fitting (CRM and tracers). We applied these techniques to tracer data from 10 injectors and 10 producers of the Lawrence Field. Results suggest that interwell connectivity obtained from the CRM is in good agreement with the observed peak-tracer concentrations. All tracer models are capable of giving a good fit in most of the cases. After comparing the tracer models, we determined that the combined model can represent a tracer flow better than the other two models alone. We also found that the simultaneous-fitting method gives the best fit to total producer-rate data and tracer data. Simultaneous fitting mitigates the nonuniqueness of the fits, leading to an improvement of tracer matching. The reservoir properties obtained in this study (Koval factor and dispersion coefficient) also were analyzed and compared with those from previous measurements. "

The study is of one-dimensional (1D) two-phase (CO2 and water) countercurrent flow. The analytical model describes CO2 buoyant migration and accumulation at a “flow-barrier zone” (low permeability) above a “flow-path zone” (high permeability). The relative importance of permeability retardation and capillary trapping is examined under different magnitudes of buoyant-source fluxes and porous-media properties. In the limiting case of zero capillary pressure, the model equation is solved using the method of characteristics (MOC). Permeability-retarded accumulation, induced by the permeability difference between the flow path and the barrier zone, is illustrated through CO2-saturation profiles and time/distance diagrams. Capillary trapping is subsequently accounted for by graphically incorporating a capillary pressure curve and capillary-threshold effect. Results demonstrate that the accumulation contributions from both the permeability hindrance and capillary trapping are convolved at sufficiently large fluxes. At a given time, the total CO2 accumulated by permeability hindrance is greater than that accumulated by capillary trapping, but the former approaches the latter at large time. The low-permeability zone need not be completely impermeable for accumulation to occur. We demonstrate that considering only capillary trapping understates the amount of CO2 accumulated beneath low-permeability structures during significant periods of a sequestration operation. "

The model was developed to study the effect of structural trapping, solubility trapping, and residual trapping on the partitioning of CO2 in oil, gas (free or residual), and brine phases over time. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of various injection scenarios, such as CGI (Continuous Gas Injection) and WAG (Water Alternating Gas), on the different trapping mechanisms. First, we used a high-resolution geocellular model, which was constructed from wireline logs, seismic surveys, core data, and stratigraphic interpretation. As the initial distribution of fluids plays an important role in CO2 partitioning, a comprehensive pressure-production history matching of primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery was completed. The hysteresis model was used to calculate the amount of CO2 trapped as residual. CO2 solubility into brine was verified based on previous experiments. The model results show a new understanding of relative CO2 partitioning in porous media. Although it was believed that structural trapping is the largest of the trapping mechanisms during CO2 injection and the first years of post-inject ion, our results show that in a carbonate field like SACROC, which contains a light oil, the solubility of CO2 in oil plays a very important role, even in the first stage of CO2 injection. Running a comprehensive history matching shows the deficiency of previous models to estimate the amount of trapped CO2 during and after the injection period. Among the various scenarios explored, WAG seems to be a promising operational approach to balance both storage and oil production.

                    "abstract": "There are several parameters affecting the net and gross CO2 utilizations during a CO2-EOR process. Although many of the parameters cannot be changed for a specific hydrocarbon reservoir, the field development strategy is one of the parameters that could be chosen in a way to get the most favorable CO2 utilization ratios, oil production, and CO2 storage. This paper presents a field scale compositional reservoir fluid flow model in the SACROC (Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee) unit, Permian Basin. The model was developed to investigate the impact of various injection scenarios, such as CGI (Continuous Gas Injection) and WAG (Water Alternating Gas) on CO2 utilization ratio, oil production, and CO2 storage during CO2 injection. Additionally, we demonstrated the amount of stored CO2 in different phases: dissolved in brine, miscible in oil, residual CO2, and mobile CO2 and correlated the contribution of different trapping mechanisms to the utilization ratios. A high-resolution geocellular model, which was constructed based on wire-line logs, seismic surveys, core data, and stratigraphic interpretation, is used for numerical simulations. Previous studies skipped the history matching of the field; however, the initial distribution of fluids plays an important role in CO2–EOR efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive history matching of primary, secondary, and tertiary recovery was conducted for this study. The history matching process included matching the average reservoir pressure, the oil and water production, and most importantly the gas production. The results show that the utilization ratio is not a constant number and evolves during the injection period. The results of this study also shows how the evolution of oil miscibility trapping over the injection time controls the evolution of net CO2 utilization ratios. CGI showed higher utilization ratios than WAG. We also compared both the total stored amount and the amount of stored CO2 in different phases. Finally, we compared the amount of produced oil for the assumed field development strategies. Results show that the amount of produced oil by WAG and CGI are so close. Among the various scenarios explored, WAG seems be a promising operational approach to balance both storage and oil production. The present work provides valuable insights for optimizing oil production and CO2 storage based on the evolution of net CO2 utilization ratios. "

                    "abstract": "Simple or proxy production models are potentially very useful and tractable because they are computationally attractive whilst still providing insight to the decision at hand. Useful and tractable models are required for supporting high-quality decisions in uncertain, complex, and computationally demanding contexts. A key decision for development planning is: what is the optimal time to initiate an Improved-Oil-Recovery (IOR) process. We aim to illustrate the implementation and application of a useful and tractable approach for the analysis of the optimal IOR switch time using a two-factor production model and Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation. The two-factor production model contains only two parameters for each recovery phases. One parameter describes how much recovery efficiency a recovery mechanism can ultimately achieve whilst the other describes how fast the recovery efficiency increases. The simplicity of the model makes it computationally attractive. The LSM algorithm is an approximate dynamic programming approach, which allows for learning over time. It provides a near-optimal solution for the IOR switch time problem. The Value-Of-Information (VOI) framework—a powerful decision-analysis tool—provides an estimate of the value of learning. Closed-Loop Reservoir Management (CLRM) is considered to be a state-of-the-art approach to solving for the optimal IOR switch time. However, this approach can produce a suboptimal solution as the CLRM approach considers only uncertainties and actions reflecting currently available information but not those uncertainties and actions arising from future information. The dynamic programming approach used here considers both the impact of the information obtained before a decision is made and the impact of the information that might be obtained to support future decisions. We conclude that a dynamic programming approach, such as the LSM algorithm, can significantly improve both the timing and value of decisions, leading to a significant increase in a field's economic performance. Furthermore, the two-factor model combined with the LSM algorithm is tractable and provides useful insight into the IOR switch time problem. The novelties provided by this work are: developing and illustrating the structure of the IOR switch time problem in a decision tree, demonstrating and discussing the suboptimality of the CLRM solution, developing and illustrating the detailed steps of applying the LSM algorithm for the IOR switch time decision, and implementing the two-factor model combined with the LSM algorithm for analyzing the optimal IOR switch time.

                    "abstract": "The effects of well locations and control parameters on reservoir responses is important during CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection. Oil recovery and CO2 storage capacity typically vary with respect to corresponding changes in WAG ratio, slug size, and injector locations. The relationships between control parameters and response variables are usually studied using compositional simulators. However, the computational expense required to run such simulators could hinder their applicability to optimization procedures requiring many evaluations. Surrogate models (proxies) provide inexpensive alternatives for approximating reservoir responses. In this study, a machine learning-based proxy is developed to predict responses to changes in location and control parameters during WAG injection. Slight adjustments in injector well locations, WAG ratio and slug size could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. This complex relationship between control parameters and reservoir-wide responses makes data-driven methods an attractive option. We extend a recently developed machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and water and gas injection rates, and the primary response is net present value (NPV). Because of the complexity of the response surface, we augmented the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Connectivities are represented by ‘diffusive times of flight’ of the pressure front, which is computed using the Fast Marching Method. Training observations are obtained from a handful of compositional simulations. We then used the Extreme Gradient Boosting method (XGBoost) to build intelligent proxies for making predictions given any set of observations. We propose a hyperdimensional, simultaneous optimization of well locations and controls using a novel optimization scheme similar Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). Our optimization scheme was developed to fully take advantage of the speed and statistical output of the proxy. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study in which the underlying geology is uncertain. Results show significant correlation between proxy predictions and reservoir simulations, which validates application of the trained proxy. In addition, we demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of location and controls yields improvements over a sequential approach without any significant increase in computational cost. "

While many geological properties cannot be changed in a specific hydrocarbon (HC) reservoir, it could be shown that an intelligent selection of CO2 injection strategy improves both the incremental oil recovery and CO2 storage capacity and security. Therefore, we investigated and discussed the partitioning of CO2 among different phases (oil, gas, and brine) after two well-known CO2 inejction schemes using field-scale compositional reservoir flow modeling in the SACROC (Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operators Committee) unit, Permian Basin.

The model results showed a new understanding of relative CO2 partitioning in porous media after a CO2-EOR process. We compared the contribution of CO2 trapping mechanisms and the sweep efficiency of Walter-Alternating-Gas (WAG) and Continous-Gas-Injection (CGI). We found that WAG injection showed a significantly superior behaviour over CGI. WAG not only decreased the amount of mobile CO2 (structural trapping), but also resulted in a competitive incremental oil recovery in comparison with CGI. Thus, clearly WAG injection ispreferred as it strongly enhances CO2 storage efficiency and containment security. The present work provides valuable insights for optimizing oil production and CO2 storage in carbonate reservoirs like SACROC unit. In other words, this work helps decision makers to set storage goals based on optimized project risks. "

Proxy models are routinely developed to generate spatially-varying output such as field pressures and saturations, or well responses such as production rates and bottom-hole pressures. In this study, a machine learning approach is adopted to predict reservoir responses based on injector well locations. The proxy developed in this work is trained to reproduce reservoir-wide objective functions, i.e., total profit, cumulative oil/gas produced, or net CO2 stored. Because of the geological complexity of most reservoirs, slight adjustments in injector well locations could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. Hence, most proxies do not include well locations as inputs in their formulation. This complex relationship between well locations and reservoir-wide responses makes non-parametric, machine learning-based methods an attractive option. We introduce a machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and the primary response is a defined objective function such as NPV. The complexity of the response surface with respect to well locations necessitates that we augment the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Introducing well-to-well connectivities yields significant improvements in prediction accuracy.

                    "abstract": "Disproportionate permeability reduction (DPR) is a phenomenon whereby many water-soluble polymer solution and polymer gels reduce the permeability to water flow more than to oil or gas flow. DPR is important for some gels that are applied to production wells in water-shutoff treatments. The mechanisms of DPR need more investigation and clarification. In this study, experiments on two different scales, core- and micro-model-scale, were conducted to study the mechanism of DPR in flow through permeable medium treated with Cr(III)-acetate-HPAM gels. The procedures for the two experiments can be similarly divided into five phases: gelant injection and gelation, oil flooding, gel rehydration with no oil phase pressure difference, oil re-flooding, and water flooding. In the core-scale experiments, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to monitor the T2 signal change during fluorine-tagged oil and water flooding after the gel treatment. NMR can detect the signal change of trapped and free water inside the gel in different pore sizes in porous medium. In the micro-model-scale experiments, a microscopic glass-etched model is subject to red oil and blue water flooding alternately after the gel treatment. Oil extrusion under an oil phase pressure gradient and the evolution of oil flow channel are recorded by a video sensor. The subsequent water flooding is also investigated. Results show that a gel-displacement mechanism is a primary reason for the development of the oil flow path initially. As the displacement proceeds, the gel dehydration occurs induced by the oil phase pressure and therefore the flow channel continues forming, but no gel is produced during this phase. During gel rehydration, the flow channel is blocked, which can be inferred from the T2 spectrum and visual microscope image. However, the rehydrated gel can only partially reduce permeability and oil pathways re-establish easily with the subsequent oil flooding. In water flooding, water permeability decreases abruptly. The mechanisms for the disproportionate permeability reduction involve channel segregation, gel rehydration, residual oil effects, and the low permeability of gel relative to water. "

                    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection in oil reservoirs has the dual benefit of enhancing oil recovery from declining reservoirs and sequestering a greenhouse gas to combat climate change. CO2 injected in carbonate reservoirs, such as those found in the Middle East, can react with ions present in the brine and the solid calcite in the carbonate rocks. These geochemical reactions affect the overall mole numbers and, in some extreme cases, even the number of phases at equilibrium, affecting oil-recovery predictions obtained from compositional simulations. Hence, it is important to model the effect of geochemical reactions on a real-reservoir-fluid mixture during CO2 injection. In this study, the Gibbs free-energy function is used to integrate phase-behavior computations and geochemical reactions to find equilibrium composition. The Gibbs free-energy minimization method by use of elemental-balance constraint is used to obtain equilibrium composition arising out of phase and chemical equilibrium. The solid phase is assumed to be calcite, the hydrocarbon phases are characterized by use of the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state (EOS) (Robinson et al. 1985), and the aqueous-phase components are described by use of the Pitzer activity-coefficient model (Pitzer 1973). The binary-interaction parameters for the EOS and the activity-coefficient model are obtained by use of experimental data. The effect of the changes in phase behavior of a real-reservoir fluid with 22 components is presented in this paper. We observe that the changes in phase behavior of the resulting reservoir-fluid mixture in the presence of geochemical reactions depend on two factors: the volume ratio (and hence molar ratio) of the aqueous phase to the hydrocarbon phase and the salinity of the brine. These changes represent a maximum effect of geochemical reactions because all reactions are assumed to be at equilibrium. This approach can be adapted to any reservoir brine and hydrocarbon as long as the initial formation-water composition and their Gibbs free energy at standard states are known. The resultant model can be integrated in any reservoir simulator because any algorithm can be used for minimizing the Gibbs free-energy function of the entire system. "

However, large injection rates are crucial for the feasibility of closed-loop surface dissolution, and these rates could be constrained by the operation strategies and the buildup of average reservoir pressure. In this work, we compare two operating strategies to attain the optimal safe storage rates and find that the optimal operation is the multiple-rates injection. This provides the maximum injection rates and smallest well counts needed to satisfy a given storage target. The impact of elevated average reservoir pressure under infinite-acting boundary condition is quantified and evaluated for injection operation up to 30 years. "

Keeping CO2 in solution would require terminating the storage operation when the fluid front of injected CO2-saturated brine arrives at the contour of bubble point pressure in the storage reservoir. This complicates the operation and reduces the storage efficiency. To assess whether allowing a free gas phase to form would pose unacceptable risk, we conducted simulations of continuous injection until the injected CO2-saturated brine breaks through at the production well. We quantify the gas saturation profile by combining fractional flow theory and fluid flow model. We use two limiting cases for the mobility of free gas, one assumes exsolved gas remains immobile at all saturations and the other assumes gas flow with the maximum mobility. Both limits yield similar gas saturations formed within the two-phase fluid region, which is small (about 1%) in our case study, thus the risk associated with this small gas saturation is low, regardless of different relative permeability models. The accumulation time has a first-order effect on gas saturation, and it can be reduced by increasing the flow rate or methods that make the location of bubble point pressure close to the extraction well.

In this research, a new solubility model that accounts for the presence of particular ions has been developed using the Gibbs free energy minimization model. The Gibbs free energy function provides the advantage of combining different thermodynamic models - Equation of State (EOS) for hydrocarbon or gas phase components and activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components. The developed model uses Pitzer activity coefficients for aqueous phase components where experimental data available for individual salt mixtures have been used to tune coefficients.

Among reserves classification, proved reserves always capture the most attention because most value is attached to it. By the SPE definition, proved reserves must be estimated by reliable methods that have a high-at least a 90% probability (P90) - that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Decline curve analysis (DCA) is one of the most commonly used methods for proved reserves estimation throughout the industry. Through the DCA, a production history is fitted with a trend line, then the line will be extrapolated to an economic limit for the reserves estimation. If linear regression is used, the line is the \"best estimate\" that represents the performance, which corresponds to the 50th percentile value (P50). This practice, therefore, conflicts with the proved reserves definition. In this paper a method is derived to estimate the variation of the reserves spread (the difference between P50 and P90). Compared to Monte Carlo, the method gives good results. The analytical solution is then used to study the sensitivity analysis of the spread and a field application. The study covers all decline models (exponential, hyperbolic and harmonic models) and both cases where the decline exponent is known and unknown. "

A CDC is one of the most fundamental curves of oil recovery as it reveals flow conditions required for good oil displacement in porous media. Despite the importance of this critical curve, the fundamentals describing the physics of a CDC are still incomplete. We present a physical model to describe the capillary desaturation curve. The model balances the capillary pressure and applied viscous stresses caused by flow and takes advantage of contact angle hysteresis that occurs in porous media. It defines a critical oil ganglia length that depends inversely on capillary number and depends on porosity, permeability, and wettability. We have combined the critical oil ganglia expression and ganglia length distribution in porous media to arrive at an expression for the capillary desaturation curve. The model suggests that when a trapped oil ganglion is larger than the critical ganglia length, the applied pressure difference can mobilize the trapped oil ganglion. We describe the differences and similarities between our critical ganglia length expression and previously reported expressions. The model describing the relationship between residual oil saturation and capillary number was successfully verified with microfluidic experiments using various crude oils and displacing fluids. We have also demonstrated that the model applies to previously reported coreflood CDCs from sandstone and carbonate media. Extension of the model led to a single curve representation of variations in Sor with reduced pressure. This representation is independent of the chemistry of the displacing fluid. "

                    "abstract": "Production data from most fractured horizontal wells in gas and liquid-rich unconventional reservoirs plot as straight lines with a one-half slope on a log-log plot of rate vs. time. This production signature (half-slope) is identical to that expected from a 1D linear flow from reservoir matrix to the fracture face, when production occurs at constant bottomhole pressure. In addition, microseismic data obtained around these fractured wells suggest that an area of enhanced permeability is developed around the horizontal well, and outside this region is an undisturbed part of the reservoir with low permeability. On the basis of these observations, geoscientists have, in general, adopted the conceptual double-porosity model in modeling production from fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs. The analytical solution to this mathematical model exists in Laplace space, but it cannot be inverted back to real-time space without use of a numerical inversion algorithm. We present a new approximate analytical solution to the double-porosity model in real-time space and its use in modeling and forecasting production from unconventional oil reservoirs. The first step in developing the approximate solution was to convert the systems of partial-differential equations (PDEs) for the double-porosity model into a system of ordinary-differential equations (ODEs). After which, we developed a function that gives the relationship between the average pressures in the high- and the low-permeability regions. With this relationship, the system of ODEs was solved and used to obtain a rate/time function that one can use to predict oil production from unconventional reservoirs. The approximate solution was validated with numerical reservoir simulation. We then performed a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to understand how the model behaves. After the model was validated and tested, we applied it to field-production data by partially history matching and forecasting the expected ultimate recovery (EUR). The rate/time function fits production data and also yields realistic estimates of ultimate oil recovery. We also investigated the existence of any correlation between the model-derived parameters and available reservoir and well-completion parameters. "

                    "abstract": "The capillary pressure heterogeneity or local capillary trapping (LCT) determines the final distribution of CO2 in a saline aquifer during geological carbon sequestration. This locally trapped CO2 would not escape from the storage formation even if caprock integrity is compromised. It is, therefore, essential to predict the extent and storage capacity of LCT during the design of GCS projects. This work employs a fast method based on the geologic criteria to estimate the structures of local capillary traps. The method assumes a critical capillary entry pressure (CCEP) and a geostatistical realization of the reservoir entry pressure field as inputs. It then finds the capillary barriers inside the domain and identifies the grid blocks beneath clusters of barriers. These grid blocks are the local capillary traps. The criterion for choosing the CCEP is important, and we suggest a criterion in this work. We verify this algorithm by full-physics simulations in small 2D and 3D domains. We employ a large CO2 injection rate (Ngr~0.1) to fully sweep the storage domain, followed by a long period of buoyant flow to allow for complete charging of those local capillary traps. We test several CCEPs to determine the most physically representative value by comparing the LCT predicted from both methods. We find that a single value of CCEP enables the geologic algorithm to give a very good approximation of LCT distribution as well as LCT volume in uncorrelated and weakly correlated porous media. This means that the concept of CCEP is a reasonable approximation to the physical process by which traps are filled. LCT can be described in terms of percolation theory. The percolation threshold arises from the competition between connected clusters of barriers and connected clusters of local traps. We show that both the percolated CCEP (corresponding to the percolation of LCT) and optimal CCEP (corresponding to the best match between geologic criteria and full-physics simulation) change with each other in a predictable linear way for the uncorrelated capillary entry pressure field.

                    "abstract": "When CO2 migrates upwards under buoyancy in the subsurface saline aquifer and encounters local capillary barriers (regions of rock with large capillary entry pressure), CO2 would accumulate beneath these small barriers, and these accumulations are called local capillary trapping (LCT). LCT benefits storage because locally trapped CO2 has a much larger saturation than residual gas, and such trapped gases cannot escape from the formation even if leakage conduits (fractures or fault) in the seal develop during the long-term storage of CO2. Thus predicting and maximizing LCT is valuable in design and risk assessment of geologic storage projects. Modeling LCT is computationally expensive and may even be intractable by using a conventional reservoir simulator. In this work, we decouple the problem into two parts: permeability-based flow simulation and capillary entry pressure-based local capillary trapping phenomenon. The connectivity analysis originally developed for characterizing well-to-reservoir connectivity is adapted to the flow simulation by means of a newly defined edge weight property between neighboring grid blocks, which accounts for the multiphase flow properties, injection rate, and buoyancy effect. Then the connectivity was estimated from shortest path algorithm to predict the CO2 migration behavior and plume shape during injection. A geologic criteria algorithm is developed to estimate the potential LCT only from the entry capillary pressure field. The latter is correlated to a geostatistical realization of permeability field. The extended connectivity analysis shows a good match of CO2 plume computed by the full-physics simulation. We then incorporate it into the geologic algorithm to quantify the amount of LCT structures identified within the entry capillary pressure field that can be filled during CO2 injection. Several simulations were conducted in the reservoirs with different level of heterogeneity (measured by the Dykstra-Parsons coefficient) under various injection scenarios. We demonstrate the reservoir heterogeneity affects the optimal injection rate in maximizing the LCT during injection. Both the geologic algorithm and connectivity analysis are very fast; therefore, the integrated methodology can be used as a quick tool to estimate LCT. It can also be used as a potential complement to the full-physics simulation to evaluate the total safe storage capacity. "

                    "abstract": "Several solutions to the double porosity model have been presented. There are solutions for closed outer boundary systems as well as infinite acting boundary conditions with constant rate or constant pressure inner boundary conditions. A common assumption in all of these solutions is that the fracture has a quadrilateral (linear) geometry. Very few solutions exist for cases were the fracture is assumed to have a circular geometry. This is the first work that presents approximate early and late time solutions for flow from fractures that have a circular geometry where the inter porosity transfer function is model with an unsteady state function. The result obtained from this analysis shows that the function behaves in a manner identical to production data from fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs (including early time data that is usually assumed to be obscured by skin and wellbore/fracture storage effects). The double porosity model was formulated for a fractured horizontal well in which the fractures were assumed to have a circular geometry. The associated mathematical model was then solved with Laplace transforms to obtain a closed form analytical solution in Laplace space. We then derive the approximate early and late time solutions by using special properties of Bessel functions and the Laplace space solution. The solutions were derived for a constant-pressure and constant-rate inner-boundary condition with a no flow outer-boundary condition. The approximate early time solution obtained is identical to the solution obtained when the fracture is assumed to have a quadrilateral geometry. But it has two additional parameters. A detailed sensitivity analysis showed that fracture thickness does not have a significant impact on the producing characteristics. The approximate late-time solution has a production history identical to that observed from field production data. The approximate late-time solution also has a slope of two on a log–log plot of rate verses time; this has not been report before in the literature. A comparison of the approximate late-time solution to traditional linear fracture solutions with skin and storage effect lead to the development of new skin and fracture storage functions. The significance of this result is that the new skin and fracture storage functions suggest that they can be used to decouple the product of fracture half-length and the square-root of permeability from early-time production data.

                    "abstract": "Many empirical and analytical models were developed to forecast oil production. Empirical models (including data-driven models) can, for example, find correlations between oil cut and production, but they lack explicit knowledge of the physical behavior. Classic analytical models are loyal to reservoir physics. Nevertheless, they often require estimation of water saturation as a function of time, which is difficult to obtain for multiwell reservoirs. It is desirable to combine advantages of both empirical and analytical models and develop a physical-model-based method that uses field data to infer oil rate. In this paper, we propose to infer fractional-flow models from field data by use of the Koval (1963) theory. We inversely solved the Koval fractional-flow equation to obtain a relationship between water cut and dimensionless time. By history matching field water-cut data, two model parameters, the Koval factor and the producer-drainage volume, are estimated. Nevertheless, it is challenging to use the Koval approach as a predictive model directly because the injection contribution into each producer in a future-time horizon must be evaluated first. To address this issue, we combine the Koval approach with the capacitance/resistance model (CRM), which characterizes the injector/producer connectivities and response time. The material balance of fluids is established in a producer-based drainage volume to consider the contributions from nearby injectors and the time lag in production caused by reservoir/fluids compressibility. A regression approach is simultaneously advanced to minimize the model error. Because of robustly integrating the reservoir physical behavior and the data-driven approach, the combination of the Koval theory and the CRM can result in a synergy that leads to accurate oil-rate predictions. We validated this integrated method in synthetic homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs to test its reliability, and further applied it to a field case in western Venezuela. Case studies demonstrate that one can use this integrated model as a real-time tool to characterize interwell connection and to predict future oil production accurately. "

CO2injected in carbonate reservoirs, such as those found in the Middle East, can react with ions present in the brine and the solid calcite in the carbonate rocks. These geochemical reactions impact the overall mole numbers and in some extreme cases, even the number of phases at equilibrium impacting oil recovery predictions obtained from compositional simulations. Hence, it is important to study the impact of geochemical reactions on a real reservoir fluid mixture during CO2injection. In this study, the Gibbs free energy function is utilized to integrate phase behavior computations and geochemical reactions to find equilibrium compositions. The Gibbs free energy minimization method using elemental balance constraint is used to obtain equilibrium compositions arising at phase and chemical equilibrium. The solid phase is assumed to be calcite, the hydrocarbon phases are characterized using the Peng-Robinson (PR) Equation of State (EOS), and the aqueous phase components are described using the Pitzer activity coefficient model. The binary interaction parameters for the EOS and the activity coefficient model are obtained using experimental data. The impact of the changes in phase behavior of a real reservoir fluid with 22 components is presented in this manuscript. We observe that the changes in phase behavior of the resulting reservoir fluid mixture in the presence of geochemical reactions depend on two factors: 1) the volume ratio (and hence molar ratio) of the aqueous phase to the hydrocarbon phase and 2) the salinity (and composition) of the brine. These changes represent a maximum impact of geochemical reactions since all reactions are assumed to be at equilibrium. This approach can be adapted to any reservoir brine and hydrocarbon as long as the initial formation water composition and their Gibbs free energy at standard states are known. The resultant model can be integrated into any reservoir simulator as integrated algorithms can be used for minimizing the Gibbs free energy function of the entire system. "

                    "abstract": "Dispersion is the irreversible mixing that occurs during miscible displacements. Dispersion can reduce local displacement efficiency by lessening solvent peak concentration or increase volumetric sweep efficiency by spreading of the injected solvent to more of the reservoir. Dispersion is therefore an important parameter in predicting and simulating miscible displacements. The difficulty of simulating miscible displacement and understanding the effect of dispersion is also compounded by numerical dispersion, which increases the apparent dispersion in finite-difference simulation models. This paper presents an approach to estimate the total longitudinal and transverse dispersion in large-scale media by use of continuous solvent injection in a medium of finite thickness. The simulations are based on the experimental arrangement of Blackwell (1962) to estimate transverse dispersion, with experiments consisting of coinjecting two miscible fluids into different sections of the medium at similar rates. This model arrangement, coupled with analytical solutions for the 2D convection/dispersion equation for a continuously injected solvent, allows us to determine longitudinal and transverse dispersivity simultaneously for the flow medium. In this manner, we investigate the effects of stochastic permeability distributions and other scaling groups affecting first-contact-miscible simulations on dispersion. Sensitivity analysis of dispersion in stochastic permeability fields confirms that both longitudinal and transverse dispersion are scale dependent. Results also show that the effect of increasing autocorrelation of cell permeability in the longitudinal direction (parallel to flow) is to increase longitudinal dispersion, as solvent travels through more continuous layers, while reducing transverse dispersion. Increasing autocorrelation in the transverse direction reduces dispersion in both directions. This reduction is caused by equilibration of solvent concentrations in continuous sections of the reservoir, resulting in reduced solute fingering and channeling. Finally, we developed a simple procedure to use the estimated dispersivities to determine a priori the maximum gridblock size that will maintain an equivalent level of dispersion between finescale models and upscaled coarse models. Large gridblock sizes can be used for highly heterogeneous and layered reservoir models. Nonuniform coarsening (upscaling) methods were also recommended and validated for reservoir models with sets of sequential but different permeability distributions.

                    "abstract": "Oil production forecasting methods can be categorized mainly into reservoir simulation, empirical and analytical models. Simulation requires laborious reservoir modeling and history matching. Even so, the forecast might be unreliable owing to various uncertainties. Empirical models (including data-driven models) find correlations between oil cut and production, etc., but they lack of explicit knowledge of the physical behavior. Classic analytical models are loyal to reservoir physics. Nevertheless, they often require estimation of water saturation as a function of time, which is difficult to obtain for multi-well reservoirs. To tackle these deficiencies, we propose to infer fractional flow models from field data using the Koval (1963) theory. We inversely solved the Koval fractional flow equation to obtain a relationship between water cut and dimensionless time. By history matching field water cut data, two model parameters, the Koval factor and the producer drainage volume, are estimated. Nevertheless, it is challenging to use the Koval approach as a predictive model directly since the injection contribution into each producer in a future time horizon must be evaluated first. To address this issue, we combine the Koval approach with the Capacitance Resistance Model (CRM), which characterizes the injector-producer connectivities and response time. The material balance of fluids is established in a producer-based drainage volume to consider the contributions from nearby injectors and the time lag in production caused by reservoir/fluids compressibility. A regression approach is simultaneously advanced to minimize the model error. Because of robustly integrating the reservoir physical behavior and the data driven approach, the combination of the Koval theory and the CRM model can result in a synergy that leads to accurate oil rate predictions. We validated this integrated method in a synthetic heterogeneous reservoir to test its reliability and further applied it to a field case in western Venezuela. Both case studies demonstrate that this integrated model can be used as a real-time tool to characterize inter-well connection and predict future oil production accurately. "

                    "abstract": "Most decline curve methods have two main limitations; the model parameters as a rule are not functions of reservoir parameters and may yield unrealistic (nonphysical) values of expected ultimate recovery (EUR) because boundary-dominated flow may not develop in unconventional reservoirs. Over the the past few years, several empirical models have emerged to address the second limitation, but they are challenged by the time to transition from infinite-acting flow period to the boundary-dominated flow. In this study, we performed statistical and model-based analysis of production data from hydraulically fractured horizontal oil wells and present a method to mitigate some of the limitations highlighted above. The production data were carefully analyzed to identify the flow regimes and understand the overall decline behavior.  Following this step, we performed model-based analysis using the parallel-flow model (sum of exponential terms), and the logistic-growth model. After the model-based analysis, the model parameters were analyzed statistically and cross plotted against available reservoir and well completion parameters. Based on the conclusion from the crossplots and statistical analysis, we used design of experiments (DoE) and numerical-reservoir simulations to develop functions that relate the model parameters and reservoir/well completion properties. Results from this work indicate that the production characteristics from these wells are highly variable. In addition, the parallel-flow model indicates that there are at least two to three different time domains in the production behavior and that they are not the result of operational changes, such as well shut-in or operating pressure changes at the surface. All the models used in this study provide very good fits to the data and all provide realistic estimates of EUR. The cross-plots of model parameters and some reservoir/well completion properties indicate that there is some relationship between them, which we developed using DoE and flow simulations. We have also shown how these models can be applied to obtain realistic estimates of EUR from early-time production data in unconventional oil reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Production data from most fractured-horizontal wells in gas and liquid-rich unconventional reservoirs plot as straight lines with a one half slope on a log-log plot of rate versus time. This production signature (half slope) is identical to that expected from a one-dimensional linear flow from reservoir matrix to the fracture face, when production occurs at constant-bottomhole pressure. In addition, microseismic data obtained around these fractured wells suggest that an area of enhanced permeability is developed around the horizontal well, and outside this region is an undisturbed part of the reservoir with low permeability. Based on these observations geoscientists have, in general, adopted the conceptual double-porosity model in modeling production from fractured horizontal wells in unconventional reservoirs. The analytical solution to this mathematical model exists in Laplace space but it cannot be inverted back to real-time space without using a numerical inversion algorithm. We present a new approximate analytical solution to the double-porosity model in real-time space and its use in modeling and forecasting production from unconventional-oil reservoirs. The first step in developing the approximate solution was to convert the systems of partial differential equations for the dual-porosity model into a system of ordinary-differential equations. After which we developed a function that gives the relationship between the average pressures in the high-and the low-permeability regions. Using this relationship, the system of ordinary differential equations was solved and used to obtain a rate/time function that can be used to predict oil production from unconventional reservoirs. The approximate solution was validated with numerical reservoir simulation. We then performed a sensitivity analysis on the model parameters to understand how the model behaves. Once the model was validated and tested, we applied it to field production data by partially history matching and forecasting the expected ultimate recovery. The rate/time function fits production data and also yields realistic estimates of ultimate oil recovery. We also investigated the existence of any correlation between the model-derived parameters and available reservoir and well completion parameters. "

                    "abstract": "Identifying analogous reservoirs is important in planning the development of a new field. Usually, information available about a new area is limited or even nonexistent. Traditionally, the search for analogous reservoirs is carried out by experienced geoscientists. This search is subject to the availability of expertise, and the results heavily depend on the geology of the area. This paper presents a systematic and unbiased procedure to search for analogous reservoirs on the basis of information contained in a large validated database of engineering and geologic parameters. Each reservoir has its own \"fingerprint\" characterized by a set of properties, which commonly vary from one reservoir to another. The method uses multivariate statistical techniques to find a unique and reproducible list of reservoirs with fingerprints that are most similar to the selected target. The flexibility of the method allows for evaluation of different scenarios [e.g., static, dynamic, pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) behavior] by analog class. This method consists of four steps: data preprocessing, key parameters selection, multivariate analysis, and similarity ranking. The first step involves analysis and preprocessing of the data. With key-parameter selection, variables with largest impact on the case to be evaluated are identified. The third step, multivariate analysis, applies several multivariate techniques such as principal-component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. Finally, in the similarity-ranking step, we apply a similarity function to the group of previously selected \"analogous reservoirs,\" generating a similarity ranking of analogous reservoirs. Casablanca oil field was used as a target reservoir to validate this new method. This reservoir is a mature carbonate field very well-known by Repsol, which had experts that identified four analogs. The new developed method was independently applied in this case to obtain 19 analogous reservoirs sorted by similarity criteria. The maximal similarity found was 85% for the Amposta Marino reservoir; this was one analogous reservoir independently identified by the business-unit team. Moreover, these four analogous reservoirs previously identified were within the first ten positions in similarity ranking. These results are encouraging because they ensure a reproducible response regardless of the user expertise. The singular feature of this new method is that it is based on a similarity function, which accounts for all the weighted key parameters (KPs) simultaneously. Commercial software often uses sequential filters. As a result, the procedure we present will support the predictive search of missing properties for the target reservoir, reducing the uncertainty for decision making. "

This paper describes the field-scale design optimization of coupled CO2-EOR and storage operations from the viewpoint of oilfield operators. We introduce two categories of EOR-storage design optimization problems: the fixed storage requirement and integrated asset optimization. The first problem follows an environmental-driven objective by giving priority to the storage element of CO2-EOR and storage; the second prioritizes the oil recovery to the storage and adjusts the storage volume commitment based on the economic benefits. Each problem is elaborated through a set of common but specific technical and economic assumptions, which are mainly based on the USA circumstances. The results quantitatively describe the relations between the design parameters, reservoir properties, asset size, and the economic parameters. With appropriate economic conditions and fiscal incentives, specifically in the form of storage tax credit, coupled CO2-EOR and storage could be attractive for both the oilfield operators and the government. In addition, CO2-EOR and storage is not the ultimate solution to the industrial-scale CO2 storage requirements. A medium-size industrial capture and storage for 25 years through EOR requires an asset size greater than the current field-scale EOR operations in the USA. Finally, the reservoir properties significantly affect the economic benefits for both the oilfield operators and the government. The proposed workflow may serve as a screening tool to rank the EOR-storage candidates and prioritize the most promising prospects for both the oilfield operators and the government. "

This paper quantifies the win-win condition for this partnership in terms of an optimum storage tax credit. We introduce a basic conceptual model for the CO2 market and investigate the market sustainability conditions. We quantitatively show how the storage tax credit affects the optimum economic storage capacity of an oilfield as well as the benefits for the oilfield operator and the government. Two field-scale models for the EOR-storage operation are developed, namely Sandstone and Carbonate. The Sandstone model is tuned according to the top 10% performing West Texas CO2-EOR reservoirs while the Carbonate model is tuned according to the moderately performing reservoirs. The EOR-storage performance of the simulated Sandstone and Carbonate reservoirs is likely to be moderate to optimistic where the oil production performance is between 50 and 100 stbd/well and the CO2 utilization is between 5 and 10 Mscf/stb. Assuming $60/stb oil price and $80/tonne anthropogenic CO2 cost, the storage tax credit should be between 20 and $40/tonne to allow for an economically feasible EOR-storage operation and satisfy market sustainability (win-win) for both the oilfield operators and the federal government. Below this range, EOR-storage is infeasible and neither the operators nor the government gain benefits (lose-lose); above the optimum tax credit range the government spends too much while the operator gains benefits (lose-win).

                    "abstract": "Unconventional plays have considerable uncertainty in production and economics. This paper proposes Decision Entropy Theory to represent uncertainty in unconventional plays in an objective and defensible way. The motivation to develop this theory is to account for the possibility of events occurring that are beyond our range of experience. This theory characterizes uncertainty in the context of making a decision; the case of maximum uncertainty corresponds to the maximum entropy for the possible outcomes of the decision. Assessing the value of test wells before committing to developing a play with unconventional resources is used to illustrate the theory. We pose the decision to develop an unconventional play in terms of the cost of development, the ratio of the return-on-investment for productive wells in the play, and the uncertain frequency of productive versus unproductive wells in the play. Results for the value of tests wells are obtained and provided graphically in non-dimensional relationships. Significant conclusions are the following: The probability distribution for the uncertain frequency of productive wells is important both for deciding whether or not to develop a play and for the value of information from test wells. It is unreasonable to assume that the probability distribution for the frequency of productive wells can be established based entirely on experience because that precludes the possibility of events beyond our experience. Such events can be particularly important with unconventional plays where experience tends to be limited. The value of test wells is enhanced when leaving open the possibilities for profit on a play with a small return-on-investment ratio and the possibility for loss on a play with a large return-on-investment ratio. There is a balance between relying entirely on historical data from analogous plays versus not relying on them at all. Within this balance, information for test wells at a new play can be combined with information from analogous plays to inform the decision about developing the new play. The value of test wells in a new play depends on the break-even frequency of good wells in the play; in the case of no information, this value is a maximum when the break-even frequency is 50 percent.

                    "abstract": "Description Fluids injected during secondary and tertiary floods often leave parts of the reservoir unswept mostly because of large heterogeneity and mobility ratio. Several applications require an analytical scheme that could predict production with as few parameters possible. We develop such an analytical model of volumetric sweep that aims to apply an extension of Koval’s theory (Jain and Lake, 2013) where flow is assumed to be segregated under vertical equilibrium conditions for secondary and tertiary displacements. Application The original Koval factor is applicable for upscaling secondary miscible floods. The new analytical model for secondary and tertiary floods is applied to provide quick estimates of oil recovery of miscible as well as immiscible displacements, which is then calibrated against field data. The model parameters, Koval factor, sweep efficiency and pore volume, estimated after history matching could be used to make reservoir management decisions. The model is very simple; history matching can be done in a spreadsheet. Results, Observations and Conclusions Single-front, gravity-free, displacements can be modeled using Koval factors. Two-front, gravity-free, displacements can also be modeled using Koval-type factors for both the fronts. These Koval-type factors, coupled with laboratory scale relative permeabilities, allows for scaling the displacement to a larger reservoir system. The new method incorporates by-passed pore volume as a parameter, a difference between this work and that of Molleai, along with Koval factors and local front velocities. For two front displacements, it also accounts for the interaction between the fronts which honors correct mass conservation, another difference with the work of Molleai. The results from new models for secondary and tertiary displacements were validated by comparing them against numerical simulations. The application was also demonstrated on actual field examples. Significance of Subject Matter Current techniques for reservoir surveillance rely on numerical models. The parameters on which these numerical models depend on are very large in number, introducing large uncertainty. . This technique provides a way to predict performance without the use of computationally expensive fine scale simulation models, which could be used for reservoir management while reducing the uncertainty.

Especially, a plot of EOR projects versus time, taken from the surveys, has been a mainstay of plenary talks. But there is much more in the database than this, and the purpose of this work is to find out what can be learned from a broader analysis. The paper uses standard statistical techniques to infer binary correlations between columns of data. With fewer than 300 US projects, the analysis does not meet the standards of Big Data; we focus on quantities that should be related on engineering grounds. But there nevertheless are some things to be learned because of the scope of surveys that that surveys since 1986, and cover all EOR processes. Processes that are more represented in the surveys than others are analyzed in more detail. We perform analysis using Bayes theorem to infer the probability of success of steam EOR projects. We compare these results to those of binary screening as exemplified in the work of Martin et al. (1997), and updated by Dickson et al. (2010). Among other factors, the work forms an attempt to see how well these guidelines have been followed in practice. Given the variety of reservoirs covered in the surveys, it is not surprising that relationship between parameters are difficult to tease out. We find negative correlations between oil recovery and pattern spacing, and oil mobility. There is a positive correlation between recovery and project life. The Bayesian analysis indicates that steam projects have a substantial probability of success outside the binary guidelines window, especially with respect to oil viscosity. We also show evidence of one parameters, for example permeability, being able to compensate for another. For example a large permeability can compensate for a small oil viscosity. In other words, the method looks at combinations of properties rather than one at a time. "

To date, there are few theoretical studies on estimating how much bypassed oil within an oil reservoir could be mobilized by such vibrational stimulation. To fill this gap, this paper presents a numerical method to estimate the extent to which the bypassed oil is mobilized from low to high permeability reservoir areas, within a heterogeneous reservoir, via wave-induced cross-flow oscillation at the interface between the two reservoir permeability areas. This work uses the finite element method to numerically obtain the pore fluid wave motion within a one-dimensional fluid-saturated porous permeable elastic solid medium embedded in a non-permeable elastic semi-infinite solid. To estimate the net volume of mobilized oil from the low to the high permeability area, a fluid flow hysteresis hypothesis is adopted to describe the behavior at the interface between the two areas. Accordingly, the fluid that is moving from the low to the high permeability areas is assumed to transport a larger volume of oil than the fluid moving in the opposite direction. The numerical experiments were conducted by using a prototype heterogeneous oil reservoir model, subjected to ground surface dynamic loading operating at low frequencies (1 to 50 Hz). The numerical results show that a sizeable amount of oil could be mobilized via the elastic wave stimulation. It is observed that certain wave frequencies are more effective than others in mobilizing the remaining oil. We remark that these amplification frequencies depend on the formation’s elastic properties. This numerical work shows that the wave-based mobilization of the bypassed oil in a heterogeneous oil reservoir is feasible, especially when combined with another EOR method, such as wettability alteration by low-concentration surfactant injection. The extension of this research into a more realistic three-dimensional reservoir model would help determine the optimal locations and frequencies of wave sources that could maximize the volume of mobilized oil.

The CRM model is widely used as a complement to real time reservoir analysis and improved oil recovery in water and CO2 floods. However, the current CRM model is based on a material balance of the total fluid and only the pressure propagation equation is considered. However, saturation changes are also important especially when the water cut is small. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a coupled CRM model based on two-phase flow by incorporating fractional flow theories. In the coupled CRM model, we construct material balances on both total fluid and oil. Relative permeability is introduced to separate the effect of oil flow from the flow of total fluid. The Koval method is incorporated to estimate the dynamic pore volume. An IMPES scheme is used to update pressure and saturation equations at each time step. By semi-analytically coupling the pressure and saturation in a producer-based control volume and using constrained multivariate nonlinear regression, the new coupled model can quantify the inter-well connection and the average saturation. As a result, the coupled CRM model can be extended to the whole time frame of water and gas floods. This new model was tested in heterogeneous synthetic fields and then applied to field cases. Both studies show that the connectivities and time constants obtained are reasonable and correspond well with field geology knowledge. The saturation profile also matches the simulation results. The coupled CRM model is also compared with current CRM model. The results indicate that the connectivities can be different. Further validation and prediction verified that the coupled model is more accurate to describe well connections. By incorporating the saturation variations to reflect two-phase flow, the coupled CRM model successfully overcomes the limitation of previous version by extending it from being used only in mature floods to the whole life of water and gas floods. This work can lead to a more informed workflow of optimizing injection scheme, and ultimately serve the goal of improving oil recovery. "

This paper presents a scaling model that is capable of producing reasonable estimates of oil recovery for a SP flood using a simple spreadsheet calculation. The model is also useful for initial SP design. We present key dimensionless groups that control recovery for a SP flood. The proper physics for SP floods including the optimal salinity in the three-phase region and the trapping number for residual oil saturation determination has been incorporated. Based on these groups, a Box–Behnken experimental design is performed to generate response surface fits for oil recovery prediction at key dimensionless times. The response surfaces derived can be used to estimate the oil recovery potential for any given reservoir and are ideal for screening large databases of reservoirs to identify the most attractive chemical flooding candidates. The response function can also be used for proper design of key parameters for SP flooding. Our model will aid engineers to understand how key parameters affect oil recovery without performing time consuming chemical simulations. This is the first time that dimensionless groups for SP flooding have been derived comprehensively to obtain a response function of oil recovery as a function of dimensionless groups. "

We develop such an analytical model of volumetric sweep that aims to decouple heterogeneity from the mobility ratios for tertiary miscible displacements. The developed analytical model is solved by applying method of characteristics. The application is to provide quick estimates of oil recovery of displacements, as well as to provide scale up information for larger simulations. The original Koval work also provides a means of estimating oil recovery for miscible floods but it works if a single front displacement is assumed. This could be a limitation for tertiary floods where an oil bank forms and displacement has two fronts (Figure 1). This work also accounts for the interactions between these two fronts as they move in the reservoir, unlike previous work (Mollaei, 2011). This work could further be extended to tertiary polymer and ASP floods where similar oil bank forms at pixel scale for prediction of oil recovery. For fields with large heterogeneity, which have severe channeling, the oil cut is small, the production history takes a long time to complete, and ultimate recovery is reached very slowly. Two-front, gravity-free, displacements can be modeled using the new model based on Koval's theory. This model captures the aspects such as oil cut reaching a peak and then falling off with very high ultimate recovery times for tertiary miscible floods. Current techniques for upscaling displacement rely on empirical models. The parameters on which these empirical methods depend cannot be easily correlated to the parameters (heterogeneity, mobility ratio and dispersivity) that govern flow at the fine scale. This technique provides a way to predict performance without the use of computationally expensive fine scale simulation models. "

                    "abstract": "Acid gases (CO2/H2S) injected in aquifers for continuous hydrocarbon production from sour gas fields (gas reserves with acid gas contaminants) can react with the ions present in the brine. The solubility predictions are then, quite different than those without reactions. Accurate solubility estimates in the presence of such reactions are integral towards developing an effective acid gas disposal strategy for continuous production from these fields. Also, the modeling of CO2 injection in oil reservoirs entails complex interplay of flow, geochemical reactions and hydrocarbon phase behavior. The geochemical reactions affect the component mole numbers, which can change the number of hydrocarbon phases and/or affect the distribution of components in them. In this research, we propose the Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm that integrates geochemical reactions and phase behavior to find equilibrium compositions for these two applications. We use this algorithm to find equilibrium compositions for not just pure phase equilibrium (without reactions) but also phase and chemical equilibrium (with reactions).While the number and composition of the hydrocarbon phases may vary; we assume all the geochemical reactions are at equilibrium. In the first application, we use this algorithm to estimate solubility of acid gases (CO2 and/or H2S) in pure water as well as CO2 solubility in high salinity brine. The algorithm predicts the solubility for binary systems of CO2-H2O and H2S-H2O at high pressures and at temperatures upto 50°C. The use of Pitzer's activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components also helps predict the solubility of CO2 in high salinity brine. In the second application for hydrocarbons, we investigate the impact of geochemical reactions on the phase distribution of CH4-CO2-H2O mixture. We observe that the geochemical reactions do not change the equilibrium phase mole fractions at 50°C in the pressure range 0.1-20 MPa.  "

                    "abstract": "Dispersion (or local mixing) degrades miscibility in miscible flood displacements by interfering with the transfer of intermediate components that develop miscibility. Dispersion, however, also can improve oil recovery by increasing sweep efficiency. Either way, dispersion is an important factor in understanding miscible-flood performance. This paper investigates longitudinal and transverse local mixing in a finite-difference compositional simulator at different scales (both fine and coarse scale) using a 2D convection-dispersion model. All simulations were of constant-mobility and -density, first-contact miscible flow. The model allows for variations of velocity in both directions. We analyzed local (gridblock) concentration profiles for various miscible-displacement models with different scales of heterogeneity and permeability autocorrelation lengths. To infer dispersivity, we fitted an analytical 2D convection-dispersion model to the local concentration profile to determine local longitudinal and transverse dispersivities simultaneously. Streamlines of simulation models were traced using the algorithm proposed by Pollock (1988). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic attempt to numerically study local transverse dispersivity. The results show that transverse mixing, which is usually neglected in the 1D convection-dispersion model of dispersion, is significant when the flow direction changes locally as a result of heterogeneity. The computed streamlines, which highlight the variation in flow directions, agree with the computed transverse dispersivity trends. We find that both transverse and longitudinal dispersion can grow with travel distance and that there are several instances in which transverse dispersion is the larger of the two. Often, the variations in the streamlines are suppressed (homogenized) during upscaling. This paper gives a quantitative and systematic procedure to estimate the degree of transverse mixing (dispersivity) in any model. We conclude that local mixing, including transverse mixing, should be considered when upscaling a fine-scale model for miscible displacement to ensure proper preservation of fine-scale sweep and displacement efficiency and ultimate oil recovery for miscible-displacement simulations.

                    "abstract": "This paper examines the limits of the Walsh and Lake (WL) method for predicting the displacement performance of solvent flood when miscibility is not achieved. Despite extensive research on the applications of fractional-flow theory, the prediction of flow performance under the loss of miscibility has not been investigated thoroughly. We introduce the idea of an analogous first-contact miscible (FCM) flood to study miscibly degraded simultaneous water and gas (SWAG) displacements using the WL method. Furthermore, numerical simulation is used to validate the WL solution on one oil/solvent pair. In the simulations, the loss of miscibility (degradation) is attributed to either flow-associated dispersion or insufficient pressure to develop the miscibility. 1D SWAG injection simulations suggest that results of the WL method and the simulations are consistent when dispersion is limited. For the 2D displacements, the predicted optimal water-alternating-gas (WAG) ratio is accurate when the permeable medium is fairly homogeneous with a limited crossflow or is heterogeneous with a large lateral correlation length (the same size or greater than the interwell spacing). The results suggest that the accuracy of the WL method improves as crossflow is reduced. In addition, linear growth of the mixing zone with time is observed in cases for which the predicted optimal WAG ratio is consistent with the simulation results. Hence, we conclude that the WL solution is accurate when the mixing zone grows linearly with time. "

                    "abstract": "Injection and production rates are often the most readily available data in a waterflood. Yousef and coworkers have shown that these data can be analyzed using a method, called the capacitance model (CM), to determine interwell connectivity. The connectivities can, in turn, provide a tool for reservoir characterization and management. The CM gives best results when the number of producers is constant and when the producer pressures (BHPs) are known. If pressures are unavailable (as is often true with legacy assets), they are assumed to be constant over the time period being analyzed. In many cases, however, these conditions are not satisfied. This paper describes two enhancements of the CM to relax these requirements: the segmented CM and the compensated CM. Taken together, these become the segmented/compensated CM and provide a means to increase the CM tolerance to common field conditions. The segmented CM can be used where unknown BHPs change during the analysis interval. The compensated CM overcomes the requirement to rerun the model after adding a new producer or after shutting-in an existing producer. If both BHP changes and shut-in periods occur, both modified CMs can be used simultaneously to construct a single model for a period of data. In several simulated cases with unmeasured fluctuating BHPs, the segmented and compensated CM successfully determined the true interwell connectivities. Ignoring the BHP data typically gave 2–10 times the root mean squared error of the segmented/compensated CMs. In an application to North Buck Draw field, which both lacks BHP data and has several producer shut-ins, the CM connectivity parameters were compared to the tracer test results and an earlier geological study. We observed good agreement between the modified CM and the amounts of higher-quality fluvial facies in the system. Also, the CM results correlated better with the results from tracer tests run in the field than when the unmodified CM was applied. "

The committee prioritized these needs and called them the \"R&D Grand Challenges\": increasing recovery factors, in-situ molecular manipulation, carbon capture and sequestration, produced water management, higher resolution subsurface imaging of hydrocarbons, and the environment. These \"grand challenges\" incorporate as much as possible enabling technologies (e.g., drilling performance can improve recovery) as well as address the technical disciplines within the SPE organization - Drilling and Completions; Facilities and Construction; Reservoir Description and Dynamics; Production and Operations; Health, Safety, and the Environment; and Management and Information. It is the intent of the SPE R&D Committee to articulate and promote the benefits of R&D in the upstream oil and gas industry so this third series of invited guest JPT articles was begun in May 2011. These have been published every two or three months with two remaining articles to appear. The R&D Grand Challenges Series, comprising articles published in JPT during 2011 and 2012, is available as a collection on OnePetro (SPE-163061-MS). A recent report by the US National Academy of Engineering (Grand Challenges for Engineering, NAE 2008) identified 14 grand challenges covering the broad range of engineering disciplines that await engineering solutions and that, when accomplished, will make significant improvements to the broad realms of human concern: sustainability, health, vulnerability, and joy of living. Two of those challenges are in Earth resources engineering: developing carbon sequestration methods and providing clean water. Many other engineering challenges fall into the category of Earth resources engineering so a task force composed of members of the academy’s Earth Resources Section identified four challenges that were the most critical. They are: The primary objective of Earth resources engineering is to apply engineering principles to the discovery, development, and environmentally responsible production of subsurface Earth resources. The traditional engineering disciplines for this objective are mining engineering, mineral processing engineering, petroleum engineering, and geological engineering. However, other science and engineering disciplines contribute critical expertise, particularly geophysics and hydrogeology. The skills needed to explore and produce resources from the Earth are also important in the study of earthquakes, the subsurface flow of groundwater, the storage of wastes such as carbon dioxide or nuclear wastes, and the design of subsurface structures for human habitat or subsurface infrastructure such as electrical cables or pipelines. Make the Earth Transparent That the solid Earth is opaque is a major obstacle in all aspects of Earth resources engineering. The challenge for subsurface engineering is similar to the imaging problem in medicine. We need tools that will allow us to see into the subsurface just as medical tools allow doctors to see into the human body. Geological structures range from the microscopic grains and crystals of the rock matrix and associated pore spaces to the topography of a basin. This range spans nanometers to kilometers, or 12 factors of 10. To complicate matters further, geological properties are mostly anisotropic (vary with direction) and heterogeneous (vary in space). Because of the scale effect, many methods and tools are required to characterize geological structures. On the largest scale (1–10 km spatial resolution), airborne gravity, magnetic and electromagnetic imaging, and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar measurements are used. On the scale of 10–100 m, seismic waves are used, either actively generated by explosive charges or mechanical vibrators or naturally generated by distant earthquakes or ocean waves. On a smaller scale of centimeters to 1 m, a variety of well logging tools that use electromagnetic, nuclear, and gamma ray technology exist. "

The research has two parts based on the deterministic and the stochastic nature of the problem. In a deterministic study, the SP flood performance (ultimate recovery efficiency and oil-rate vs. time) of TORIS reservoir database (the Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System) was predicted using the modified CFPM. Results helped to determine the best candidates for SP flooding based on each reservoir's rock and fluid properties. From there we can determine the effect of different parameters (reservoir rock and fluid properties, injection design variables) on ultimate recovery efficiency and peak oil rate of an SP flood, which gives good clues about the sensitivity of output results to different input parameters. Stochastic study helps to recognize the behavior of the model under uncertain inputs. We used a variance-based sensitivity analysis (SA) method known as Winding Stairs (WS), which needs much fewer runs than traditional Monte-Carlo (MC) and Latin Hypercube methods. The results of the SA method facilitate identifying the most important sources of uncertainty of SP floods either through direct influences or interactions with other parameters. Based on these results we can reduce the uncertainty of output results of SP flood significantly by reducing the uncertainty of the input parameters that cause the largest uncertainty. "

                    "abstract": "Several equally probable sets of uncertain reservoir parameters can normally match a production history. Such equiprobable history-matched solutions (EPHMS) are a way to estimate the uncertainty in hydrocarbon-recovery predictions. In most cases, time and resource limitations permit evaluation of only few of the EPHMS, thereby reducing reliability of predictions of numerical models. As a precursor to comprehensive numerical simulations in a probabilistic frame, we suggest the use of capacitance–resistance model or CRM. In CRM only injection and production rates are needed. The CRM is a fast analytic tool for history matching and optimizing waterfloods. In this study, we used CRM and a Buckley–Leverett-based fractional-flow model to rapidly generate many EPHMS. The EPHMS represent a unique combination of major reservoir variables, such as residual saturations, endpoint mobility ratio, oil and water in-place volumes, and recoverable oil. We used production data from two matured waterfloods and a synthetic field (Synfield) to evaluate the EPHMS. For most cases, one thousand EPHMS and the consequent cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for several uncertain variables, including recoverable oil, were developed. We compared the CDFs obtained from EPHMS to that of 200 finite-difference simulations performed on the Synfield by changing porosity and residual saturations. EPHMS mimicked the same uncertain range of production forecasts used earlier in the finite-difference model. This approach attested to the goodness of CRM solutions and its ability to quantify reservoir uncertainty. Two field examples illustrated applications of the proposed approach at the field and pattern levels, and provided clues about the remaining oil and its monetary value. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate and simple techniques for measurement of fluid rheological properties are important for field operations in the oil industry, but existing methods are relatively expensive and the results can be subjective. This is particularly true for measurements of fluid yield stress, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Marsh Funnels are popular quality-control tools used in the field for drilling fluids and they offer a simple, practical alternative to viscosity measurement. In the normal measurements, a single point (drainage time) is used to determine an average viscosity; little additional information is extracted regarding the non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. Here, a new model is developed and used to determine the rheological properties of drilling muds and other non-Newtonian fluids using data of fluid volume collected from a Marsh Funnel as a function of time. The funnel results for viscosity and shear-thinning index compare favorably to the values obtained from a commonly-used Fann 35 viscometer. More importantly, an objective, static method for determining yield stress is introduced, which has several advantages over dynamic, extrapolation techniques used for rheometer data. "

However, the nature and implications of these interactions are not well understood. Dispersion coefficients obtained from averaged cup-mixing concentration histories have contributions of convective spreading and diffusion lumped together. We decouple the contributions of convective spreading and diffusion in core-scale dispersion and systematically investigate interaction between the two in detail. We explain phenomena giving rise to important experimental observations such as Fickian behavior of core-scale dispersion and power-law dependence of dispersion coefficient on Péclet number. We track movement of a swarm of solute particles through a physically representative network model. A physically representative network model preserves the geometry and topology of the pore space and spatial correlation in flow properties. We developed deterministic rules to trace paths of solute particles through the network. These rules yield flow streamlines through the network comparable to those obtained from a full solution of Stokes' equation. Paths of all solute particles are deterministically known in the absence of diffusion. Thus, we can explicitly investigate purely convective spreading by tracking the movement of solute particles on these streamlines. Then, we superimpose diffusion and study dispersion in terms of interaction between convective spreading and diffusion for a wide range of Péclet numbers. This approach invokes no arbitrary parameters, enabling a rigorous validation of the physical origin of core-scale dispersion. In this way, we obtain an unequivocal, quantitative assessment of the roles of convective spreading and diffusion in hydrodynamic dispersion in flow through porous media. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper suggests a numerical indicator to examine the nature of miscible displacements in heterogeneous permeable media. We compare miscible displacements through evaluating the patternsof the mixing zone development. Previous studies pointed out that the competition between effects is the cause of developing various types of flow regimes (dispersive, fingering, gravity override, and channeling). However, the distinction between these flow patternsis yet only possible visuallyrather than quantitatively;hence, the traditionalvisual method fails to differentiate between the cases representing a similar flow pattern. Further, it is lacking the capability of evaluating the displacement performance as the flow regime changes.  We adapt the notion of the correlation coefficient function to study the progression of the mixing zone for each case study. The correlation coefficient function of the lengths of the mixing zone calculated between two different time represents the tendency to propagate linearly with time. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient function of the squared length of the mixing zone corresponds to linearly growth withTime. Using the arithmetic average of the correlation coefficient functions over successive time intervals, we introduce a flow regime indicator to studythe nature of miscible floods. We use a simulation approach to validate the numerical indicator. The numerical valuesare consistent with the visual observation.  We conclude that the proposed flow pattern indicator is an effective measure of the mixing zone development in heterogeneous permeable mediaspecifically when the cross flow is limited. The suggested procedure identifies the type of flow regime at any stage of the displacement and helps monitoring the evolution of the mixing zone. The latter is important in the prediction of the displacement performance. Through this study, we investigate the relation between the proposed indicator and the missing oil. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this study we develop an integrated asset model (IAM) for a greenfield offshore oil development and demonstrate its use in an uncertainty analysis workflow. The proposed framework enables a systematic quantification of the uncertainties and provides users with an in-depth understanding of the impact of uncertainties on major design and operational decisions. The IAM is specified for a hypothetical deepwater field to investigate three decisions: optimal initial facility capacity, optimal number of pre-drilled wells, and the optimal number of drilling rigs. The uncertainty analysis addresses two critical variables: reservoir thickness and the transmissibility between the reservoir compartments.  This work develops and demonstrates a fast-solving physics-based integrated optimization model where production, drilling, and facility expansion decisions are endogenous (that is, the model solves for these variables implicitly) and thus provides higher quality (and faster) guidance in many cases than the design-of-experiments and response surface workflows currently being used in the oil and gas industry.  Introduction In the oil and gas industry, a field development plan is a key document used to achieve proper communication, discussion and agreement on the activities required for the development of a new field or extension to an existing development (Jahn et al., 2003). The main purpose of a field development plan is to define a conceptual project specification for subsurface and surface facilities and the operational and maintenance philosophy required to support a proposal for the required investments. It should demonstrate to management and shareholders that all key issues have been identified and evaluated, and that there has been full participation of all of the relevant technical and non-technical disciplines. Major decisions that are addressed in an offshore field development plan include the type of production facility to install, number and location of platforms, platform size and functionality, number and location of wells (production and injection), number of subsea wells, production and injection rates over time, improved oil recovery methods (what type, when, how), etc.  At the concept selection phase of a new project many concepts and options are analyzed and screened to determine viable options to carry forward for further analysis and detailed engineering. This analysis is complicated for new oil field developments because there is often very little information on which to base the analysis. That is, at this phase, there are only a small number of wells in the reservoir from which reservoir parameters can be estimated. This limited information introduces uncertainty into the concept selection phase which is then propagated through to the field development plan (Volz, 2008). This uncertainty can have a significant impact on the economic performance of the project because decisions made at the concept selection phase have a large impact on the ultimate value derived from the project (Vasantharajan, 2006; Walkup and Ligon, 2006). Therefore, methods are needed to facilitate decision-making under uncertainty.  Methods for planning and optimization under uncertainty are not new in the oil and gas industry. Examples in the literature include planning production and operating policies, location and sizing of offshore platforms for oil exploration, and production scheduling, including the scheduling of offshore oil field infrastructure investment (Aronofsky and Williams, 1963; Mantini and Beyer, 1979; McFarland et al., 1983; Lasdon et al., 1984; Haugland et al., 1988; Hansen et al., 1992; Iyer et al., 1998). However, a small minority of the previous studies investigate methods for integrating uncertainty. Only more recently did Lund (2000) describe the application of a stochastic dynamic programming model and show the importance of flexibility in offshore petroleum projects. His presentation assessed both market (oil price) and reservoir uncertainty. Ettehad et al. (2010, 2011) present a workflow and an integrated model for comprehensive uncertainty analysis in gas storage and gas field development, including the specification of a stochastic model. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we introduce a novel technique to determine the storage capacity of a saline aquifer for CO2 trapped because of the capillary snap-off and dissolution. The capillary snap-off trapping and dissolution into the aqueous phase are two principal mechanisms of the CO2 sequestration in an intermediate time-scale. The CO2 storage capacity of aquifers provides a criterion to determine the best candidates.  However, conducting numerical simulations to assess the CO2 storage capacity of an aquifer is complex and time-consuming because of various trapping mechanisms acting simultaneously with various rates on different time scales. Further, these simulations require detailed inputs and hence are limited to site-specific study.  We adopt the notion of the optimal solvent-water-slug size and use the graphical solution of multiple geochemical front propagation and fractional flow theory to determine the largest (optimal) slug of injected CO2 trapped because of the capillary trapping and the dissolution. The optimal slug size is the CO2 storage capacity of the aquifer because injecting more than the optimum leads to production of injected CO2 and injecting below the optimum leaves the aquifer unfilled. The two cases represent overcapacity and under-capacity storage, respectively. We use numerical simulation to validate the accuracy of the predicted optimal slug size. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the predicted values.  In practice, the proposed method provides an efficient screening method to assess the CO2 storage capacity of aquifers and significantly reduces the simulation costs.  Introduction CO2 capture and geological storage (CCGS) is a promising technology for long-term storage of CO2 to mitigate its accumulation in the atmosphere and detrimental impacts on climate. However, a general lack of knowledge about an accurate storage capacity of deep saline aquifers stands in the way of immediate full-scale implementation of CCGS (IPCC 2005; Bradshaw et al. 2007).  Evaluation of the CO2 storage capacity in deep saline aquifers is very complex as there are multiple trapping mechanisms acting simultaneously at different rates.  In the context of CO2 storage in aquifers, the involved trapping mechanisms are: 1. Structural (hydrodynamic) trapping, the upward migrating buoyant CO2 is suppressed by an impermeable cap rock (Bachu et al. 1994) 2. Capillary snap-off trapping, injected CO2 breaks up into immobile ganglia (Kumar et al. 2005; Juanes et al. 2006) 3. Solubility trapping, CO2 dissolution in an aqueous phase (Ennis-King and Paterson 2005; Riaz et al. 2006) 4. Mineral trapping, dissolved CO2 reacts with rock minerals and leads to carbonate minerals precipitation (Gunter et al. 1997) 5. Local capillary trapping, accumulation of the upward migrating buoyant CO2 beneath of a region with larger capillary entry pressure than average (Saadatpoor et al. 2010)  This study is on the two trapping mechanisms that are likely to be effective on an intermediate time-scale: capillary snap-off and dissolution trapping (Sifuentes et al. 2009; Juanes et al. 2009). Injected CO2 in an aquifer displaces the resident water under a drainage mechanism (assuming the gas phase is nonwetting). Resident or post-injection water displaces CO2 through an imbibition process. The hysteresis in the gas relative permeabilities causes snap-off at the pore scale and, subsequently, trapping of the gas phase. In addition, CO2 dissolves into brine at any contact between the aqueous and gas phases. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Extraction of oil and gas can cause reduction in pore pressure, occasionally resulting - in shallow reservoirs - in subsequent compaction that forms a surface subsidence bowl. In the last 10 years, there has been over 10 feet of subsidence in parts of the Lost Hills diatomite oil field in California (Bruno et al.1992). The surface subsidence at Lost Hills not only causes damage to surface facilities and wells, but also reactivates faults and reduces rock permeability. Subsidence makes reservoir optimization difficult. Hence, it is important to assess or predict the surface subsidence and the reasons for subsidence early in the life of an oil field to make an optimization plan.  We use jointly the capacitance-resistive model (CRM) (Alberoni et al. 2003 and Yousef, et al. 2006) that relies only on injection and production data, and the inSAR satellite imagery of surface subsidence. From CRM simulations, we estimate the connectivity between injectors and producers as well as general water flow directions from individual injectors. We then superimpose well connectivity and inSAR imagery to diagnose the reasons for the subsidence. Using a new surface subsidence model, which is based on the continuity equation of CRM and rock mechanics, we are able to predict the average surface subsidence at Lost Hills from the injection and production rates.  Our work shows that there was significant volumetric rock damage at Lost Hills and the well connectivity changed dramatically with time because of the water injection- and compaction-caused rock damage. We conclude that for a soft, fragile and nearly- impermeable rock such as the diatomite, high injection rate weakens the rock and creates dynamic water flow tubes or ‘channels' without providing good pressure support to the reservoir. These high permeability ‘channels' recirculate most of the injected water between the injectors and producers.  Our CRM/inSAR approach is new and gives insights into the time-dependent and spatially variable fluid flow fields in a relatively shallow waterflood. Consequently, we may be able to suggest optimum water injection strategies to enhance oil production, while minimizing rock damage and surface subsidence. In addition, the proposed surface subsidence model is a convenient and reliable way to predict the average subsidence. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Elastic wave-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has been proposed and used as a low-cost EOR method. Strong wave motions were reported to be able to mobilize oil still remaining in previously bypassed zones. This paper discusses the feasibility of inducing resonance-like wave motion within an oil reservoir in order to maximize wave-based EOR. To this end, a novel mathematical algorithm was developed to determine the optimal conditions of wave sources that can maximize the wave motion within an oil reservoir while minimizing, if desired, the vibrational disturbance in the neighboring formations. The optimized wave sources can generate strong wave motion within an oil reservoir, thereby potentially allowing the oil ganglia trapped in rock pores to overcome the strong capillarity between the droplets and the rock matrix.  Numerical experiments were conducted to identify the unknown optimal time signal information of wave sources that can lead to the maximum kinetic energy or maximum acceleration within an oil reservoir. These numerical experiments consider realistic geometries and material properties of a hydrocarbon reservoir, as well as multiple wave sources located on the ground surface. We demonstrate that optimized time signals can result in constructive interference of wave motion within a targeted hydrocarbon reservoir. We show that such signals can be either monochromatic, where the excitation frequency corresponds to one of the discrete reservoir amplification frequencies, or can even be transient.  Overall, when the formation's characteristics are known, our method allows one to prescribe the necessary waveforms that maximize particle motion within the reservoir.  Introduction The wave-based EOR method has been proposed as a cost-effective EOR method. Typical wave sources used in wave-based EOR include Vibroseis equipment atop the ground surface, and/or wellbore hydraulic pumps (Bremmer et al. (2006)), or wellbore seismic vibrators (Paulsson (1989); Westermark et al. (2001a)). All sources are capable of generating elastic waves. In general, it has been reported that the rate of oil production increased after such vibration applications. It also appears that such wave-based EOR method is as competitive as conventional EOR methods. Firstly, because the wave-based EOR appears to be less costly than other EOR methods (Huh (2006); Surguchev et al. (2002)), and, secondly, because an elastic wave can indiscriminately illuminate the entire volume of an oil reservoir, whereas, due to the heterogeneity of a typical oil reservoir, gas- or chemical-flooding can hardly sweep the entire reservoir. The feasibility of a wave-based EOR has been supported by a set of field observations showing that elastic waves induce increased production of the remaining oil. It has been observed that the rate of oil production and/or the oil-water-cut ratio improve for several days after the arrival of an earthquake wave at existing oil reservoirs (Osika (1981); Smimova (1968); Steinbrugge and Moran (1954); Voytov et al. (1972)). Increased oil production has also been reported during field experiments employing wave sources at low frequencies, up to 200 Hz, that are located atop the ground surface or within a wellbore, in active or in seemingly-depleted oil fields (Barabanov and Pavlov (2009); Guo et al. (2004); Kostrov and Wooden (2005, 2008); Kouznetsov et al. (1998); Kuznetsov et al. (2002); Kuznetsov and Nikolaev (1990); Spanos et al. (2003);Westermark et al. (2001b); Zhu and Xutao (2005)).  Along with the aforementioned benefits, as well as field evidence, there have been investigations about the underlying mechanisms of the wave-based EOR. As a predominant mechanism of the wave-based EOR, it is suggested that the movement of pore walls can mobilize oil droplets trapped in pore spaces (Averbakh et al. (2000); Beresnev and Johnson (1994); Beckham et al. (2010); Hilpert et al. (2000)). That is, the vibration of pore walls can dislodge the trapped droplets and coalesce them into larger ones, allowing them to be mobilized and flow (see the illustration in Fig. 1). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes the application of capacitance resistive modeling (CRM) to 99 wells in a waterflooded field in the Permian Basin of West Texas. CRM is a quantitative technique based on material balance that requires only injection, production rates and well coordinates to identify and quantify interwell connectivity in a waterflood. The study uses CRM results to optimize oil production by reallocating water injection and then assesses the resulting improvement by analyzing field data after water injection has been rescheduled. This first field implementation of CRM theory shows that the oil production rate has increased 45 bbl/day and the cumulative incremental oil production in the first year is 5,372 bbls, equivalent to $402,900 at $75/bbl.  This work serves as a demonstration of how to apply and analyze CRM results. Before optimizing injection, interwell connectivities were established by fitting CRM over an appropriate fitting window selected using field events. The forecasting ability of the model was examined by fitting part of the historical data and then using the fitted model to forecast the remainder of the historical data. CRM interwell connectivities were used to optimize future production for the next five years by changing water injection rates. The optimized injection rates were applied for one year and the resulting production rates were analyzed.  The oil production rates increase after injection rates were rescheduled according to the CRM optimization. This first field test of CRM technology has demonstrated that CRM has the advantages of short computation time and of using readily available field data, and disadvantages of sensitivity to reservoir events and data errors. The connectivities are consistent with field geological knowledge. CRM can be used to improve oil production with little additional cost.  The case study shows that CRM is a simple yet powerful tool for engineers in planning and monitoring waterflood. The work increases confidence in the technique by demonstrating improvements made by using CRM in a practical context, and identifying shortcomings of the technique. CRM should be applied with knowledge of the field geology and history to understand the results and use them to enhance waterflood performance.  Introduction Large reservoir waterflood management and capacitance resistive model The traditional approach of reservoir simulation is based on the continuity equation and Darcy's law for flow through porous media. Because of the number of required input data, traditional reservoir simulation studies may take months to set up and days to complete one computer run. Especially for large mature waterflood fields with hundreds of wells, full reservoir simulation is an enormous task or can only be done on separate well patterns. Furthermore, original geological data might no longer be applicable and new measurements on a large mature field will require additional equipment and labor costs that might not be justifiable. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Marginal economics underscores the importance for accurate estimation of production profile and expected ultimate recovery or EUR in unconventional resources. While the Arps family of type-curves and the stretched-exponential model appears to yield reasonable estimation of EURs, all insufficiently explain the intrinsic behavior of unconventional reservoirs. This study introduces and applies a new semianalytical approach for estimating production profile and EUR, validated by numerical simulations and verified by field data for unconventional gas and oil reservoirs.  We obtained analytical solutions by considering concentric compressibility elements, analogous to electrical capacitors, in series using the continuity equation to obtain production from conceptual geobodies. This configuration mimics decreasing contributions from a series of concentric reservoir segments into the well with increasing distance from the stimulated-reservoir volume or SRV. The analytical formulation captures production behavior of early-time and SRV-dominated flow patterns, leading to good estimation of expected-ultimare recovery or EUR.  Introduction Performance forecasting for unconventional reservoirs has gained considerable momentum given the substantial resource base and ever-increasing demand for energy in North America. This trend is not unique to North America; development has also started in Europe, China, Argentina, and some parts of Middle East. Beyond the challenges in drilling, stimulation and assessing its effectiveness, production forecasting is a cornerstone to assessing the economic viability of a given project. The importance of such assessments early in the life of the development cannot be overemphasized.  To meet such forecasting needs, various methods have been proposed to model the production decline behavior and the ability to forecast a well's performance from data of various quality and quantity. For long-term performance forecasting, the methods of Ilk et al. (2008, 2010), Valko (2009), and Valko and Lee (2010) are considered as modern techniques. Using these methods, Kabir et al. (2010) attempted to shed light on the practical meaning of expected ultimate recovery or EUR by examining the boundary-dominated response of the stimulated-reservoir volume or SRV. Overall, the study showed that the stretched-exponential model provides a conservative estimation of EUR compared to others and the results are agreeable with those obtained from flow simulations. Beyond these decline-curve methods, the logistic growth models (Tsoularis and Wallace 2002) in the biological sciences may hold considerable promise for predicting performance in unconventional systems. For instance, Clark's (2011) study shows that the Blumberg (1968) model outperforms Arps in unconventional gas reservoirs.  In this study, we attempted to understand the intrinsic production behavior in an unconventional reservoir, where formation permeability ranges from micro- to nano-Darcy, resulting in very slow propagation of signal away from a producer. If a theoretical frame can be established, much of the uncertainty arising from the empirical models may be minimized. To that end, Shahamat and Aguilera (2010) offered new insights into modeling by considering Darcy flow through two compartments; that is, source and sink, with flow resistance in between. Miller et al. (2010) also discussed a methodology wherein linear flow predominates within the SRV and also from outside of it, thereby capturing the notion of compartments. In our formulation, we consider a number of arbitrary reservoir compartments, each making variable contributions to production in a given well. We invoke the capacitance-resistance modeling concept to arrive at the final formulation. By applying the new formulation on synthetic and field data and comparing the results with the stretched-exponential model, an improved understanding of well performance can be realized. "

A challenge in implementation is to understand the potential impact of uncertainty on optimal decision-making. To mitigate the risks and seize the opportunities arising from the uncertainty, the models used in the decision-making process should include a robust capability for stochastic optimization. This paper presents a case study in development optimization of a two-compartment offshore gas field. The analysis focuses on the optimization of facility size, well counts, compression power and production policy. A stochastic programming model is developed to investigate the impact of uncertainties in original gas in place and inter-compartment transmissibility. Reservoir tank equations are used to model pressure and production responses. The reservoir and well equations are coupled with economic and surface facility models. Results of two solution methods, optimization with Monte Carlo sampling and stochastic programming, are analyzed and compared. The models are then used in a value of information (VOI) analysis. The current work is part of an emerging effort in industry to introduce fast and efficient methods for optimizing field development under uncertainty. Computational efficiency is a significant advantage of the proposed approach because it eliminates most constraints on the scope of the uncertainty analysis. The intended applications of this approach are project screening, scenario and uncertainty analyses, including VOI analysis. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a new procedure to obtain unique estimates of interwell connectivities, pore volume, and productivity index in primary and secondary recovery. This method approaches the problem by analytically integrating the simplified continuity material balance equation. The proposed procedure uses linear multivariate regression on rate, initial reservoir pressure and bottom hole pressure (BHP) data. The method quantifies compressible pore volume - the capacitance, productivity index (PI), and degree of communication between well pairs - the resistance to flow. Hence, it is called the integrated capacitance-resistive (ICR) model.  The ICR model fits cumulative production against rates, BHP, and cumulative water injected. For primary recovery, the model has been validated on synthetic field data generated by numerical simulator, covering the effects of initial oil saturation, heterogeneity, and number of wells. The model was also tested on a real field. For secondary recovery, the procedure was tested on synthetic fields with high permeability channels.  In all primary recovery synthetic fields tested, good fit and less than 13% error of estimated pore volume and PI were observed. Real field application also shows good agreement with geological knowledge. For waterflooded synthetic fields, the estimated parameters are consistent with the geology and the results obtained from the capacitance resistive model (CRM) fit. The confidence intervals of the parameters are narrow enough to conclude regression coefficients are statistically significant. Hence, the ICR model can be used to quickly estimate reservoir properties and infer interwell communication in primary and secondary recovery from available data with high confidence.  The ICR model is comparable to CRM in terms of number of inputs. Hence, both models can be used in large fields with hundreds of wells. However, the nature of the CRM's nonlinearity makes it difficult to establish confidence intervals of the model parameters and obtain a unique set of model parameters for a large number of wells. In the proposed method, a unique solution can always be obtained regardless of the number of parameters via linear regression. The simpler formulation of the ICR model would reduce the computation time and easily establish the confidence intervals of model parameters.  Introduction A reservoir volume is traditionally estimated using porosity from rock core analysis and saturations in the volumetric method (Walsh and Lake, 2003). In this work, we propose a novel method - the integrated capacitance-resistive (ICR) model-- based on material balance to estimate reservoir properties from production data. The approach requires the same inputs as the CRM proposed by Yousef (2006) to determine inter-well connectivities in waterflood but the ICR model approaches the problem differently. It is applicable to both primary and secondary recovery. In primary recovery, this technique suggests a quick, simple diagnostic tool at very little aditional cost for the reservoir engineer. The ICR model can determine dynamic pore volume, productivity index and reservoir pressure directly from production data with little error. Furthermore, no well shut-in is required to obtain these properties as compared to the traditional buid-up test. Hence, lost production is completely avoided. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract With the commercial development of extremely low permeability oil and gas reservoirs, new challenges have arisen both from operational and reservoir standpoints. Reservoir models, which previously yielded reasonable results for reserves estimates and production forecasts, no longer do so. Various new models and techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy and reliability of reserves estimates; however, none have gained widespread industry acceptance. This paper will propose a new empirical model for production forecasting in extremely low permeability oil and gas reservoirs based on logistic growth models. The new model incorporates known physical volumetric quantities of oil and gas into the forecast to constrain the reserve estimate to a reasonable quantity. The new model is easy to use, and it is very capable of trending existing production data and providing reasonable forecasts of future production. The logistic growth model does not extrapolate to non-physical values.  Introduction One source of production to meet the demand for oil and gas has come from extremely low permeability oil and gas reservoirs, often referred to as unconventional resources. These unconventional resources typically exhibit permeabilities in the nanodarcy to microdarcy range. The production from these wells is characterized by very long and extended periods of transient flow before reaching the reservoir boundary, and entering into boundary-dominated flow. Thanks to drastic improvements in both horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, these resources have been able to be successfully exploited in North America. Along with providing many new challenges in successfully drilling and completing unconventional wells, they have also provided new challenges in accurately forecasting the reserves.  The traditional empirical Arps' equation used to forecast reserves in conventional reservoirs, often gives over estimates of reserves when used in these extremely low permeability formations. Commonly the b values obtained are greater than 1, which results in an unrealistic production rate that never approaches 0. The purpose of this paper, however, is not to discuss the errors encountered when using the Arps' equation, as the problem has already been thoroughly discussed in the past. Lee (2010) and Ilk et al. (2008) have both provided good explanations of the problems encountered with the traditional models as have numerous other authors over the years. Various new models for use in production forecasting in tight reservoirs have been proposed including Maley (1985), Ilk et al. (2010), Kupchenko et al. (2008), and Valko (2009). The industry has been slow to adopt the new methods for forecasting reserves despite the apparent over estimation of reserves encountered when using the traditional decline curve models. This paper presents a new method for empirically forecasting production based on the logistic growth model.  Logistic Growth Models Logistic growth curves are a family of mathematical models used to forecast growth in numerous applications. Originally developed by the Belgian mathematician Pierre Verhulst in the 1830s, logistic growth curves were used to model population growth. Verhulst based his ideas on the works of Malthus who believed that the population of a particular country or region would only be able to grow to a certain size before competition for resources would cause the growth to stabilize. Verhulst took this idea and by adding a multiplicative factor to the equation for exponential growth, created the logistic growth model. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract To date the analysis of pressure transients associated with formation tester pretests assumes that the temperature remains constant during the measurement. Most fluids experience a decrease in temperature when undergoing an expansion, as in the case of the drawdown; therefore, it is to be expected that the temperature of the fluid within the flowline of the formation tester will change for typical pretest conditions. The object of this study is to assess the impact of these temperature transients on the pressure signal measured with single probe formation testers.  The governing equations to analyze pressure and temperature changes in the flowline have been identified. The semianalytic solution presented here couples conductive heat transfer with conservation of mass in the flowline. Sensitivity studies and practical applications are provided to illustrate the importance of thermal effects on the pressure signal recorded during the pretest. It is demonstrated theoretically that in addition to the pretest parameters (rate and volume) and tool parameters (probe size and flowline volume), the specifics of the formation tester design and environmental conditions (pressure, temperature, type of drilling fluid) are relevant to quantify the impact of temperature effects on the measurement of sandface pore pressure with a formation tester.  It has been found that the rate of thermal equilibration during the buildup could affect the behavior of the pressure signal. In particular, thermal effects may extend the duration of the flowline storage period. The two major consequences are: 1) longer time could be required for the flowline pressure to equilibrate to the sandface pore pressure; and, 2) it is possible for flowline storage effects to mask the deep formation response, e.g., spherical flow, in the late part of the buildup. The latter could introduce errors in the interpretation of the buildup pressure signal to obtain formation mobility. Other situations of practical interest, such as \"false buildups?? after a dry pretest, and \"builddowns??, i.e., a decrease in the pressure signal after an overshoot beyond the sandface pressure during the buildup, are also addressed here.  Introduction Currently, the analysis of formation tester pretests assumes that the temperature of the fluid in the tool flowline remains constant during the test. Tool storage effects, which dominate practically all the drawdown and the initial portion of the buildup, are modeled assuming isothermal conditions (e.g., Yildiz et al. 1991; Proett and Chin 1996; Kasap et al. 1999); the largest pressure variations in the pretest occur during the storage period. Under the right conditions, once storage effects abate, it might be possible to measure a pressure signal associated with the recompression of the fluid in the formation that could contain information about the mobility outside the damaged region around the wellbore. Moran and Finklea (1962) identified that spherical and radial flow could be the relevant types of flow for formation testers in the reservoir region beyond the wellbore. In practice, the identification of these flow regimes is used for quality control of the measurement, an indicator that the pretest has been successful; however, over the years it has been found that obtaining formation mobility from the interpretation of the latter part of the buildup is not robust.

                    "abstract": "Dispersivity data compiled over many lengths show that values at typical interwell distances are approximately two to four factors of 10 larger than those measured on cores. Such large dispersivities may represent significant mixing in the reservoir or they may be a result of convective spreading driven by permeability heterogeneity. The work in this paper uses the idea of flow reversal to resolve the ambiguity between convective spreading and mixing. We simulate flow-reversal tests for tracer transport in several permeability realizations using particle-tracking simulations (free from numerical dispersion) on 3D, high-resolution models at the field scale. We show that convective spreading, even without local mixing, can result in dispersion-like mixing-zone growth with large dispersivities because of permeability heterogeneity. But, for such cases, the dispersivity estimated on flow reversal is zero. With local mixing (diffusion or core-scale dispersion), the dispersivity value on flow reversal is nonzero and much larger than typical core values. Layering in permeability, while increasing the convective contribution to transport, also enhances mixing by providing larger area in the transverse direction for diffusion to act. This suggests that in-situ mixing is an important phenomenon affecting the transport of solutes in permeable media even at large scales. Dispersivity values increase with scale mainly because of the increase in the correlation in the permeability field, but they could also apparently appear to do so because the Fickian model fails to capture the mixing-zone growth correctly at early times. The results and approach shown here could be used to differentiate between displacement and sweep efficiency in field-scale displacements, to ensure accurate representation of dispersive mixing in reservoir simulation, and to guide upscaling workflows. The flow-reversal concept motivates a new line of inquiry for laboratory- and field-scale experiments. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Permeability is one of the most important parameters for evaluating the production potential of a reservoir. Though there are several ways to determine permeability, the focus here is on formation tester pretests. The pretest is a routine measurement that provides in situ values of formation mobility (permeability/viscosity) at several depths along a wellbore. Because this measurement is easily accessible, it is of interest to maximize the value of the information obtained.  Two types of mobility can be determined from a pretest, one of them is the mobility obtained using the amplitude of the pressure signal, usually referred to as drawdown mobility. This measurement has a very shallow depth of investigation; therefore, it characterizes only the formation in the immediate vicinity of the probe, i.e., it is an indicator of the mobility at the wellbore wall, where formation damage is likely to occur.  The uncertainty associated with this mobility measurement decreases when the drawdown is long enough to approximate steady state flow. Another way of inferring mobility is done by analyzing the pressure transient signal during the late stage of buildup, during the so-called spherical flow period, hence it is referred to as the spherical mobility. This method has the advantage of characterizing properties deeper in the formation.  However, the spherical flow regime is usually difficult to identify in the recorded pressure signal, and in the few instances where it has been claimed to be identified, the inferred formation mobility is almost always smaller than the drawdown mobility. A major problem in analyzing pressure data during the spherical flow period is that it requires quantifying a small rate of change in the signal as equilibrium is approached. "

                    "abstract": "Rigorous flow simulations to obtain estimates for recovery are infeasible given many combinations of reservoir and development scenarios. This motivates an alternative approach to calibrate likelihood of recovery using reservoir datasets. A proxy model relating reservoir, well, and operational factors to the ultimate recovery factor could guide subsequent field-scale flow simulations. There are two reservoir datasets that we have used for the classification and estimation of ultimate recovery: the Tertiary Oil Recovery Information System (TORIS) database for oil reservoirs and the Gas Information System (GASIS) database for gas reservoirs. For oil reservoirs, 19 predictor variables were used to estimate the ultimate recovery factor.  Cluster analysis was followed by linear regression analysis within the identified clusters that provided a reliable deterministic model for predicting the recovery factor. The linear regression model was compared with the empirical correlations given by Arps et al. (1967) and Guthrie et al. (1995).  Analysis showed that geological and engineering parameters are correlated and both are important to the prediction of recovery factor. Later, we used a naïve Bayesian approach on principal scores of the predictors for the calibration of recovery factor likelihood. The likelihood function of the recovery factor for oil reservoirs provided the uncertainty in recovery. It was computed to be multimodal and non-Gaussian. In case of the gas reservoirs, good deterministic estimation was achieved by introducing cluster analysis to the data. The robustness of the linear regression model was tested on tight gas reservoirs. The likelihood of recovery factor was multimodal and non-Gaussian. It also indicates that gas reservoirs are less complex. Introduction Decision analyses for reservoir development using decision trees and/or portfolio optimization using real options require reliable probabilistic estimates for reservoir recovery corresponding to different recovery scenarios (Hultzsch et al., 2007; Faya et al., 2007). This motivates an alternative way of calibrating the probabilistic estimates of recovery using reservoir data sets. Data mining is the process of uncovering patterns, associations, anomalies and the statistical significance of relations in the data (Han et al., 2001). It is generally applied to multi-dimensional data that are not possible to analyze using simple techniques. Data mining consists of two main parts, data preprocessing and pattern recognition. Pre-processing is an important but time consuming step. Depending upon the data to be analyzed, pre-processing consists of various steps. This may include de-noising, extraction of features and normalization/standardization of features. Depending upon the problem we may need to reduce the number of features, using feature selection techniques or dimension reduction techniques, like principal component analysis or nonlinear techniques. The data would then be ready for pattern recognition techniques like clustering, classification and regression. The workflow associated with data mining is in Fig. 1. "

                    "abstract": "This paper concerns the limits of the Walsh and Lake (WL) method for predicting solvent-flood performance when miscibility is not achieved. Despite extensive research on applications of fractional flow theory, prediction of flow under loss of miscibility has not been investigated thoroughly. We introduce the idea of an analogous first-contact miscible (FCM) flood to the WL method. To compare the WL solution of degraded miscible simultaneous water and gas (SWAG) displacements, we use numerical simulations. In the simulations, the loss of miscibility is attributed to either dispersion or insufficient pressure (degradation). The results of one-dimensional (1D) SWAG injection suggest that results of the WL method and the simulations are in agreement when the input dispersion is limited. For the two-dimensional (2D) displacements, the WL solutions are accurate in two sets of simulation cases: (1) fairly homogeneous permeable media with limited cross flow (2) heterogeneous permeable media with lateral correlation length of the same size or larger than the interwell spacing. The accuracy of the WL method improves in the latter cases as the cross flow decreases. Also, we observe a linear growth of the mixing zone with time in cases where the WL solution and the numerical results are consistent. Further investigation illustrates an inverse relation between the level of mixing, resulting from the input dispersion and heterogeneity, and the accuracy of the WL approach. Through this work, the effect of dispersion and miscibility degradation on the miscible residual oil saturation, Sorm, is determined. Introduction Despite large microscopic displacement efficiency, miscible gas injection has small volumetric sweep efficiency. On the other hand, injecting water in alternating slugs or simultaneously with gas forms a more stable displacement front. In principle, co-injection of water and gas is a well-known technique to integrate the benefits of both miscible gas injection and water flooding. The key to design a SWAG injection is to determine the water alternate gas (WAG) parameters such as the optimal WAG ratio and the optimal solvent-water slug size. The practical method to determine the WAG parameters is numerical simulation. Depending on the size of reservoir model and its complexity, simulations are time-consuming and there is yet no alternative in practice. Therefore, the motivation of the work is to examine the accuracy of an alternative theoretical method. Buckley and Leverett (1942) proposed the concept of fractional flow theory, which was used later for gas floods by Welge et al. (1961). SWAG injection is a multicomponent and multiphase displacement of oil/water by solvent/water. The multicomponent and multiphase flow theory was stated by Helfferich (1981) who showed that the fundamental mathematical description of the mass conservation equation is similar to various enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Pande et al. (1987) showed that the 1D fractional flow solution can be generalized to 2D flow in the absence of cross flow. In addition, Koval (1963), Todd and Longstaff (1972) and Fayers et al. (1994) introduced empirical models to estimate the performance of multidimensional miscible injections. In this study, we generalize the WL method to 2D displacements. The hypothesis is: \"the WL method (which we call modified WL) will apply to solvent floods that are not miscible (miscibility is degraded) if the residual oil to solvent, Sorm, is known??. The objectives are: (1) to verify the hypothesis in 1D flow, (2) to examine the hypothesis in 2D displacements, (3) to investigate the mixing zone growth for cases where the modified WL solution is consistent with the results of numerical simulations.

                    "abstract": "Electromagnetic (EM) heating, also called high-frequency heating, generates EM waves through an antenna located inside a wellbore and parallel to the reservoir sand-face. The EM energy heats the reservoir from within, causing oil viscosity to lower and oil production to increase. Recent studies (Carrizales et al. 2008) showed that oil rate can be increased with the application of EM heating for single-phase radial flow. No simulations results or detailed modeling studies have yet been published that completely model the complex interactions of EM energy and multiphase flow. This paper presents a multiphase, two-dimensional radial model that describes the three-phase flow of water, oil, and steam and heat flow in a reservoir within confining formations. The model accounts for the appearance and/or disappearance of a phase, and uses the variation in temperature and water saturation to continuously update the EM heating rate. A single well is used to locate the EM source, and also to produce oil. Gravity effects and vertical heat loss into the confining layers are included. This model allows determining the temperature distribution and the productivity improvement from EM heating when multiple phases are present. This model will be useful to predict the recovery of heavy oil by EM heating where conventional steam injection is not attractive. To solve the model we used Lagrange-quadratic finite elements in the environment provided by COMSOL Multiphysics and its partial differential equations (PDE) application. Several simulations were made for hypothetical reservoirs with different fluid and rock properties. Special attention is on reservoirs with characteristics for which steam injection does not look attractive or feasible. Results show the feasibility of conducting EM heating based on the power source and frequency used to maintain an optimum absorption coefficient and to obtain higher production rates avoiding excessive power consumption. Also, a comparison shows that cumulative oil production and recovery factor obtained by EM heating is better than what is achieved by cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), especially for thin payzones. Introduction Thermal recovery methods have the objective of accelerating hydrocarbon recovery by raising the temperature of the formation, and reducing hydrocarbon viscosities. Thermal recovery involves several well-known processes such as steam injection, in situ combustion, steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), and a more recent technique that consists of heating the reservoir with electrical energy. Among these methods, steam injection leads by far in development and application. However, there are many reservoirs where steam injection has proven to be uneconomical and unsuccessful. Low permeability reservoirs (< 200 md) and extra-heavy oil reservoirs (< 8 °API) are examples as referred by Taber et al. (1990). These reservoirs represent a potential target for an alternative method such as EM heating that allows producing them in a continuous and profitable manner. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Many researchers have observed an increase in ultimate oil recovery by injecting low salinity brine in laboratory and field experiments.  In this work, linear laboratory corefloods were conducted to study the effect of low salinity waterflooding on oil recovery rate, residual oil saturation and relative permeability. We conducted 21 different waterfloods using nine brines, three crude oils, six outcrop Berea cores and two oil reservoir cores. Every core used was at least 11 long and pressure taps were use to measure pressure drop across sub-sections of the core.  Increase in ultimate recovery of crude oil with decrease in salinity of injected brine was observed in several, but not all, cases. These results suggest that that injecting low salinity brine changes the wetting state of some cores from mixed to water-wet and that this change improves the ultimate oil recovery. This hypothesis of a changing wettability is supported by the following observations: (1) When low salinity injection produced higher oil recovery, the end-point water relative permeability krwº decreased and post-waterflood end-point relative permeability to oil kroº increased. (2) Injecting low salinity brine produced a persistent wettability alteration (toward water-wet) that eliminated oil recovery salinity dependence in subsequent floods. (3) The oil recovery salinity dependence noted in (2) could be restored by extended aging (thus restoring mixed-wetness). (4) Injecting low salinity brine improved recovery by delaying breakthrough, suggesting an improvement in displacement stability.  Introduction Injection of low salinity brine has improved waterflood recovery in numerous laboratory and field experiments. The general consensus among researchers is that injecting low salinity brine creates a wetting state more favorable to oil recovery. Wettability affects the microscopic distribution and flow of oil and water in porous media and thus the residual oil saturation. The mechanisms responsible for this wettability alteration are debated.  Researchers1, 6 began injecting fresh water into core samples almost a half century ago. Bernard1 observed increased oil recovery in coreflood experiments when injecting fresh water and attributed the improvement to improved microscopic sweep efficiency induced by clay swelling and plugging of pore throat by migrating fines.

However, predicting performance at larger scales and at dynamic conditions (fluid flow through fracture) remains a challenge.

It is observed that dynamic imbibition process recovers oil faster than static imbibition. Imbibition experiments performed on cores with varying height and diameter show that oil recovery decreases with increasing diameter and height. A 3D fine grid mechanistic simulator was used to perform lab scale validation and analyze recovery mechanism. Numerically simulated velocity and saturation profiles demonstrated the recovery mechanism to be gravity dominated flow. A new scaling function is proposed for surfactant aided gravity dominated processes. Data with same boundary conditions, rock, fluids and varying dimensions can be correlated with the scaling function at early times with no fitting parameters involved. A good correlation is obtained with the data indicating the effectiveness of the scaling function. The scaling is applicable to both static as well as dynamic imbibition. "

Contact angle studies, spontaneous imbibition and core flood experiments indicate that wettability alteration is responsible for this process. In this study, the core-scale manifestation of wettability mechanisms is evaluated, and a geochemical model is developed for further insight into reaction pathways. Brines of different compositions were injected into carbonate cores with no oil and the effluent was analyzed for ionic composition. Seawater, sulfate-rich seawater, and dilutions of seawater were tested. A mechanistic model was developed using our in-house reservoir simulator UTCHEM-IPHREEQC for the wettability alteration process. The model changes core wettability according to the adsorbed naphthenic acid concentration on the rock surface, which is controlled by the brine composition. The model was used to match previously published two-phase flow experiments. The single-phase core floods with test brines indicate retention of SO42− within the core. Calcite dissolution is prominent in ultra-dilute seawater injection. The relative permeability parameters for oil-wet and water-wet conditions were different, but the same for all the core floods. Model results were in good agreement with single-phase core floods and oil recovery experiments. Sulfate adsorption and calcium dissolution led to naphthenic acid desorption which in turn altered core wettability. Single-phase core floods reached equilibrium within 2 pore volumes (PV) of injection. Two-phase core floods with seawater and sulfate enriched seawater took longer to reach equilibrium, only after 3–4 PV. Oil-displacing ultra-dilute brine injection experiments did not reach equilibrium in 5 PV, particularly the Ca2+ ions, due to slow calcite dissolution. "

The chemical blend consisting of a surfactant, an oxidizing agent (which produces a weak acid) and an organic solvent was tested on shale plates and fractured cores to evaluate the reaction kinetics and the surface interactions. Reactivity of the chemical blend with the shale was compared with the reactivity of HCl. Laboratory tests demonstrated that chemical blend preserved surface hardness and surface roughness on treated shale samples compared to traditional acids. For the shale samples exposed to HCl, the surface hardness decreased to 130 MPa compared to 170 MPa for the shale samples treated with the chemical blend. When a shale sample is treated with HCl solution, the pH of the solution changed from 0.9 to 6.5 within 10 minutes, whereas that of the chemical blend showed a pH change from 2.4 to 4.5 in 3 days. The presence of sulfate ions and surfactants in the weak acid significantly delayed reactivity of the acid compared to that of the strong acid. Chemical blend changed the wettability of the shale surface into preferentially water-wet thus improving water imbibition. Micro-CT imaging showed formation of new micro-fractures after treating shale plates with the chemical blend. The fracture conductivity decreased more than 60% during HCl treatment due to mud generation, but not in the chemical blend treatment. Introduction Unconventional shales contribute more than half of the US oil production (Hughs, 2013; Maugeri, 2013). Shale reservoirs are fine grained, multi-mineral, sedimentary rocks with ultra-low porosity and permeability (Eugster et al., 1975). Due to the complexity of the matrix, shale oil production declines about 75% in the first year (Baihly et al., 2010). Hydraulic fracturing increases the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and helps drain out the oil from the SRV. Efficiency of this process can be improved mechanically and chemically. In the last decade, scientists have tried to develop chemical formulations for shale enhanced oil recovery (Nasr-El-Din et al., 2003). "

                    "abstract": "The distribution of proppants in a hydraulic fracture determines the conductivity of the hydraulic fracture and influences the shale well productivity. Proppants often settle quickly in slickwater fracturing and leave a large fractured surface unpropped. In this paper, a settling velocity correlation of proppant in foam-based fracturing fluid is developed based on laboratory-scale experiments. Proppant settling velocity in foam fluid depends on foam quality and the relative movement between the proppant and the foam bubbles. In addition, experimental results show that foam liquid drainage significantly affects proppant transport, and a foam drainage model is proposed based on an extensive literature study. Finally, proppant placement in foam fracturing treatment in field scale is evaluated by incorporating the new settling velocity correlation and the foam drainage model into an in-house fracturing simulator. For wet foams, drainage largely alters the fracture propagation and the final proppant distribution. For dry foams, drainage has limited influence on the final proppant placement. Generally, the faster the foam drains, the less uniform is the final proppant placement. Introduction The successful combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has led to a boom in the exploitation of unconventional shale resources. The current popular fracturing treatment involves pumping a large volume of slickwater (water with a small amount of drag-reducing additive) with proppants (usually sand) into shale formations which produces a thin, long primary fracture (intersecting secondary fractures) at a low cost. However, slickwater typically lead to a poor proppant placement due to its low viscosity (Kern et al., 1959) leaving a significant amount of fracture surface unpropped (Tong and Mohanty, 2017). Polymer-based gel fracturing fluid can effectively suspend proppants (Barati and Liang, 2014), but polymers can damage the shale surface leading to underperformance of the fracturing treatment. Additionally, water leak-off into the shale formation could cause clay swelling and reduce the absolute permeability of the matrix (Gu and Mohanty, 2014). Other concerns include excessive fresh water usage during slickwater fracturing and the disposal of flowback water (Vengosh et al., 2014). "

                    "abstract": "Unstable displacement and the resulting viscous fingers remain a challenge for reservoir simulation as practical gridblock sizes are usually much larger than the viscous finger wavelength. Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the oil recovery at the field scale. Several previous studies suggested that fingering can be ignored at the field scale because channeling (caused by heterogeneity) is dominant, but they missed the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. In our work, we consider that fingering and channeling coexist in the field across different scales, based on the fact that the heterogeneity increases with the scale. At the small-scale (e.g., lab-scale) where heterogeneity is small, fingering is dominant and causes oil bypassing. An effective-fingering model was developed to scale up fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, oil single-phase flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth factors of different regions, and they are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history-matches of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, fluid velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved at the lab-scale by considering relatively homogeneous cores. We extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatially accurate numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using gridblock sizes that are roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number for a gridblock at the field-scale affected by various heterogeneities. It is also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a synthetic field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. It is observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. "

Single-phase static (equilibrium) and transport experiments were performed with various brines in limestone cores at 120 °C. The ionic compositions of the effluent samples were monitored using ion chromatography. A mechanistic model for the wettability alteration process was developed in UTCHEM-IPHREEQC based on key geochemical interactions. The calcite surface was assumed to consist of positive and negative sites and their interactions with potential determining ions were considered assuming local equilibrium. The model assumed the degree of oil-wetness to depend on the amount of organic acid attached on the surface, which in-turn was dependent on the geochemistry of the system. Results of static experiments performed with crushed limestones and brines showed an increase in calcium concentration and a decrease in magnesium concentration in the supernatant brines. The effluent concentrations from single-phase brine corefloods in limestone cores showed an increase in calcium concentration, a decrease in magnesium concentration and a delay in sulfate concentration. Three key geochemical interactions were identified based on these results: mineral dissolution, surface dolomitization and sulfate adsorption. A good qualitative agreement was observed between single-phase experiments and simulations, suggesting that the model was able to accurately capture the geochemistry. The simulation results showed good agreement with zeta potential and oil recovery results reported in the literature. "

Oil droplets are thought to detach from the rock partially due to changes of the solid surface charge by multi-ion exchange with the brine. These mechanisms have been investigated in the past by measuring zeta potentials of calcite and oil, separately in test brines. In this work, the coupled calcite-brine-oil system was studied by measuring the adhesion force of an organic acid functionalized solid probe with a calcite surface, using an atomic force microscope. Brine compositions were varied in pH and ion concentration, to identify key conditions for minimum oil adhesion to calcite. Our experiments showed the strongest acid-calcite adhesion in formation brine. The adhesion force decreased in decreasing ionic strength NaCl brines, particularly below ∼0.1 mol/L where the diffuse double layer expanded greatly. The complex composition brines of ultra-dilute seawater and excess sulfate seawater each gave the lowest adhesion due to a combination of double layer expansion, surface charge change and gypsum passivation of the calcite surface. Modifying seawater's Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations showed little change in the adhesion force despite being potential determining ions for calcite. Adhesion force responded the most to pH change. Increasing pH substantially decreased the adhesion force in seawater and excess sulfate seawater until a threshold value of pH 10. Above pH 10, the adhesion increased due to brine instability (to mineral precipitation) and material precipitation onto the calcite surface. "

                    "abstract": "Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques involving surfactants such as surfactant floods, foam floods, and wettability alteration have been studied to recover remaining oil after primary and secondary floods. In these processes, a surfactant solution is injected to promote one (or more) of the following: lowering of capillary forces, improvement in sweep efficiency, and wettability alteration. Although significant advances have been made in designing surfactant molecules to achieve the above mentioned objectives efficiently, surfactant price is often the key limiting factor for a field-scale operation. Most surfactant molecules have a hydrocarbon chain (for example alkyl chain) or an aromatic ring as the main hydrophobe. The hydrocarbon chain (or ring) imparts hydrophobicity (and surface activity) to the surfactant molecule. However, these hydrophobes also result in additional cost. In this study, we discuss low-cost surfactants developed without hydrocarbon chains (or rings) for chemical EOR processes in general. The focus of this paper, however, is on their application in surfactant floods. These novel surfactants were developed by using methanol as the starting material, followed by the addition of propylene oxide (PO) and ethylene oxide (EO) groups, and an anionic head group. The surface tension and critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of these surfactants were measured. A screening study was performed to identify promising candidates; which showed ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) with various crude oils as well as aqueous stability at reservoir conditions. A comparison between novel surfactants with traditional surfactants was made based on the screening study. Oil recovery corefloods were performed in Berea and Boise sandstone cores to test the ultralow IFT formulations. These surfactants were found to have very low CMC values, and lowered the surface tension to about 32 dynes/cm. Their aqueous stability at a given temperature was found to be dependent on the number of PO and EO groups. Phase behavior experiments showed low IFT formulations with different crude oils by using these surfactants by themselves as well as in combination with internal olefin sulfonates (IOS). Moderate oil recoveries were obtained in coreflood experiments using these surfactants. "

Surfactants can reduce oil-water interfacial tension and wettability of the shale, which in turn can improve water imbibition, increase oil relative permeability and reduce water blockage at the matrix-fracture interface. Temperature in typical shale reservoirs are high and the surfactants need to be aqueous stable to be effective in these treatments. Mixing two surfactants often gives higher aqueous stability than those of the single surfactants. A large number of surfactants (anionic, non-ionic and cationic) and their blends were studied for aqueous stability, contact angle and spontaneous imbibition. Seven single surfactants and nine surfactant blends were found to be stable in both high and low salinity brines at 125 °C. All aqueous stable blends changed wettability of oil-wet shale to preferentially water-wet in both high and low salinity brines. Seven single surfactants and five surfactant blends were tested for imbibition. Surfactant solutions improved water imbibition to the extent of 20% PV. Surfactant blends improved imbibition more than the single surfactants. Imbibition in cores reached a plateau in about 3 days. Surfactant blends have the potential to be used in low salinity fracturing or refracturing fluids to stimulate shale wells. "

Recently, there has been a successful field test where an ASP flood was conducted after a polymer flood. Is the ASP flood after a polymer flood more effective than an ASP flood after a water flood? It is difficult to conduct this experiment in exactly the same location in a field. The goal of this study is to answer this question in a laboratory heterogeneous quarter 5-spot model. A heterogeneous quarter 5-spot sand pack of size 10″ × 10″ × 1″ was constructed. Two sands with a permeability contrast of 10:1 were packed into a 2D square steel cell. An alkali-surfactant formulation was identified that produced ultra-low interfacial tension with the reservoir oil (27 cp). In one experiment (WF-ASP), waterflood was conducted first followed by the ASP flood. In a second experiment (PF-ASP), polymer flood was conducted first followed by the ASP flood. The ASP formulation and slug size were kept the same. Secondary water flood of the heterogeneous quarter 5-spot recovered 22% OOIP. Post-waterflood ASP flood recovered 32% OOIP additional oil with a cumulative (WF-ASP) oil recovery of 54%. Secondary polymer flood of the same heterogeneous quarter 5-spot yielded 50% OOIP. Post-polymerflood ASP flood recovered 32% OOIP additional oil with a cumulative (PF-ASP) oil recovery of 82% OOIP. The water flood and the subsequent ASP flood swept a large part of the high permeability region and a small part of the low permeability region. The polymer flood swept all of the high permeability region and most of the low permeability region. The subsequent ASP flood swept the polymer-swept regions. These experiments demonstrate that the polymer flood - ASP flood combination is more effective than the water flood - ASP flood combination. "

Surfactants are the most expensive chemicals in these processes. However, surfactant requirement is low in case of crude oils which contain naphthenic acids. These acids with the addition of an alkali generate in-situ soap which results in lowering the oil-water IFT. The goal of this work is to investigate if surfactants can be eliminated from the formulation in case of sufficiently acidic crude oils to reduce the cost. Low IFT formulations were obtained by varying the alkali concentration in the absence of synthetic surfactants. A cosolvent was added to lower the viscosity of microemulsions and to obtain the low IFT region in the desired salinity range. Various cosolvents were systematically tested to obtain the desired phase behavior. For comparison, alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) and alkali-cosolvent-polymer (ACP) formulations were developed for the same crude oil using synthetic surfactants. One-dimensional ASP and ACP corefloods were performed in sandstone cores to test these formulations. The ASP coreflood showed 84.5% oil recovery and 0.1 mg/g-rock surfactant retention in a Berea core. ACP corefloods showed 80–90% oil recovery in Berea cores and minimal cosolvent retention, and 97% recovery in a Boise core. The study shows that comparable oil recoveries could be obtained from ASP and ACP corefloods for a sufficiently acidic crude oil, provided the cosolvent selection is performed carefully. "

A combination of bulk mineralogy, elemental composition analysis, dissolution behavior, and water ionic composition data were used to characterize the samples’ surface heterogeneity. The adsorption of anionic surfactants is 2.4 mg/m2 at pH of ∼8 and decreases approximately linearly with pH values above 9. To constrain and compare the relative adsorption affinity and the likely modes of attachment on mineral constituents as pH changes, we performed surface complexation calculations using a two-surface multisite diffuse layer model. We propose the formation of two surface species on both the major (i.e., calcite) and trace (i.e., the oxide-like sites on the edges of clay platelets) minerals: a monodentate inner-sphere complex and a weak or hydrogen bonding complex. Our modeling results suggest that charge-regulated inner-sphere complexation is the dominant adsorption mechanism on the calcite and oxide-like sites at low pH values regardless of the surface loading. We found weak or hydrogen bond adsorption to be significant on the calcite surface, and this became the dominant adsorption mode at pH ∼10. While the adsorption on calcite increases with surface loading, adsorption on the oxide-like sites remains independent of surface loading. These results suggest that surfactant adsorption can be comparable on the abundant low-surface-area calcite and trace high-surface-area oxide-like sites. "

                    "abstract": "Summary Many carbonate reservoirs have natural fractures that reduce the sweep efficiency of displacement processes. The goal of this study is to improve oil recovery by reducing fluid bypassing caused by fractures, especially in carbon dioxide (CO2) floods. The pH-insensitive polymeric particles (PIPPs) synthesized in this study can plug fractures in reservoir rocks and divert fluid flow into the rock matrix. PIPPs swell in brine similar to polymeric particle gels (PPGs) published in literature; the swelling is a function of brine salinity. A PIPP expands many times (approximately 35 times) in deionized (DI) water, but swells only approximately 3 times in very-high-salinity (20 wt% NaCl) brine. The swelling of the particles is independent of pH in the range of 2 to 12. The swelling process is reversible with salinity. In water without divalent cations, these particles are stable at 80C for at least a month. Coreflood results show that these small particles can be transported through fractures during high-salinity-brine injection and reduce the flow capacity of the fractures during low-salinity-brine injection. Subsequently, the injection fluid (brine, toluene, or CO2) is diverted into the matrix, and recovers oil from previously unswept matrix. PIPP injection increases waterflood recovery in cores with full fractures and half fractures connected to the inlet. PIPP placement also increases oil recovery for tertiary miscible/CO2 floods. "

We show that this optimization is possible when the alcohol acts as cosolvent (rather than a cosurfactant) to partition between the interface and bulk phases(s). Herein presented a phase behavior study of water, crude oil, tridecyl alcohol propoxy sulfate (C13-13PO-SO4), internal olefin sulfonate (C20-24IOS), and ethoxylated phenol (phenol-2EO) mixtures, rationalized by pseudophase theory and pseudoternary phase diagram. The detailed phase behavior study involved varying the surfactant concentration, cosolvent concentration, brine salinity, and oil content. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the interfacial composition and steady and dynamic rheology to characterize the bicontinuous middle-phase samples. Measurements confirmed that phenol-2EO acted as cosolvent. A systematic shift of phase type is observed by increasing the cosolvent-to-surfactant content in the initial water/surfactant solution. Furthermore, it was observed that the interfacial ratio of cosolvent to surfactant controls the microemulsion composition, viscosity, and volume. This ratio is highly tunable, but when too high, a distortion of the middle phase is observed. The experimental results provide a methodology to tailor the composition of amphiphile mixture for optimizing microemulsion properties. "

Alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) floods can improve oil recovery from these reservoirs by lowering the interfacial tension (IFT); however, there are several challenges such as polymer injectivity, divalent ions, geochemical interactions, pore-scale heterogeneity, and oil-/mixed-wettability. This paper addresses the first two challenges: polymer transport in low permeability carbonate cores and surfactant interaction with formation brine during ASP floods. Since polymer injection in low permeability carbonate cores is challenging, polymer transport in low permeability carbonate cores was studied. Shearing of high molecular weight polymers and successive filtration treatment were performed to reduce the polymer size distribution. Single phase polymer corefloods were performed to study the transport of treated polymers and identify the optimum pretreatment. Phase behavior experiments and aqueous stability experiments were performed to develop ultralow IFT surfactant formulations with a reservoir crude oil. ASP corefloods were performed in oil-wet low permeability limestone rocks. The oil recovery, pressure drop, effluent ionic composition, effluent viscosity and effluent surfactant concentrations were measured. Polymer hydrodynamic radius must be much smaller than the pore throat radii for the polymers to be transported. Mercury porosimetry data should be studied before polymer selection. Shearing and successive filtration can be used to reduce the hydrodynamic radii of polymers. This preprocessing worked with the HPAM polymer used in this study for the Edwards Yellow Limestone, but not for Texas Cream Limestone. An ultralow IFT ASP formulation can be developed with a formation brine with a significant amount of divalent ions by using a chelating agent. Tertiary ASP injection increased the cumulative oil production to 77% in a field core and 87% in an outcrop core. The adsorption of the anionic surfactants was limited to 0.4 mg/gm of rock in the core floods. UTCHEM simulations showed good agreement with lab coreflood experiments. "

First, aqueous stability tests of these formulations were performed at high-temperature (80 °C) and high-salinity conditions (8 wt% NaCl and 2 wt% CaCl2). The screened nanoparticles were used in combination with a surfactant. Second, bulk foam tests were performed to evaluate their foaming performance in bulk. Finally, oil displacement experiments were conducted in an in-house, custom-built 2D sand pack with flow visualization. The sand pack had two layers of silica sand — top layer with 40-70 mesh and bottom layer with 100-120 mesh, which resulted in a permeability contrast of 6:1. Water flood with subsequent foam flood was performed. The grafting of low-molecular-weight polymers/ligands on silica nanoparticle surfaces resulted in steric stabilization under high-temperature and high-salinity conditions. In the oil displacement experiments in the layered sand packs, the water flood recoveries were low (~33% OOIP) due to channeling in the top high-permeability region, leaving the bottom low-permeability region completely unswept. Foam flooding with just the surfactant leads to a drastic improvement in sweep efficiency. It resulted in an incremental oil recovery as high as 43.3% OOIP. Different cross-flow behaviors were observed during foam flooding. Significant cross-flow of oil from low-permeability region to high-permeability region was observed for the case of surfactant. Conversely, the LNP2-surfactant blend resulted in no crossflow from the low permeability layer with complete blocking of the high-permeability region due to the formation of in-situ emulsion. Such selective plugging of high-perm channels via nanoparticles with optimum surface coating has significant potential in recovering oil from heterogeneous reservoirs. "

The blend can be implemented as the pre-pad fluid ahead of hydraulic fracturing fluid or as a treatment fluid later in the life of a well. As a means to increase recovery, an energized chemical blend (CB) consisting of an organic solvent, a surfactant, an oxidizing agent (and acid) was designed, developed and tested on crushed rock, core plugs and fractured cores in the laboratory to evaluate the interactions of the chemicals with the shale samples. Micro-CT scanning and scanning electron microscopy were used to visualize morphological changes in the shale. A pilot was designed in an existing pad with stable production so that the benefits could be quantified on production rate and recovery. The results of laboratory experiments demonstrate that the chemical blend extracts up to 30% of mobile oil in crushed rocks and improves permeability by 25-100% in thin core plugs. Some of the factors that support the success of the chemical blend application are: I- Pressurization of the formation and reopening of the closed fractures, thus improving the well productivity, II- Extraction and mobilization of low mobility oil, remnants of the original kerogen, removal of deposited salt and trapped water in matrix and fracture network that impedes fluid flow, III- Creation of pathways to high-pressure liquids-rich small organic pores, where undersaturated hydrocarbon liquids are trapped, adsorbed and dissolved in the kerogen, IV- Creation of flow pathways for intrusion of aqueous based fluids in oil-wet organic rich rocks with wettability alteration to accelerate the injection, counter-current imbibition and osmosis processes, V- Enhancement of porosity and permeability of fracture surfaces by introduction of a delayed reaction mechanism to deliver acids deeper into the microfracture network without compromising rock mechanical properties. The presence of sulfate ions in the oxidizing agent did not contribute to any noticeable scale deposit while delaying the reactivity of acid with inorganic components of shale surfaces. Laboratory and field pilot results are employed to calibrate a discrete fracture network (DFN) model of the pilot well and the surrounding Eagle Ford formation. The model is used to design and optimize CB injection in future applications. "

In this work, we present a visualization study of foam flow through a two-layer, heterogeneous model, where the performance of foam stabilized by surfactant-nanoparticle mixtures is evaluated. An in-house, 2D sandpack holder was fabricated with a transparent front plate to visualize foam displacement mechanisms. It was packed with two layers of silica sand which resulted in a permeability contrast of 6:1. Foam flow and oil displacement experiments were performed using either surfactants or surfactant-nanoparticle blends. Foam flow experiments revealed that inclusion of nanoparticles increases the resistance factor (RF) by a factor of 1.95 over that of the surfactant foams. In oil displacement experiments, the water flood recoveries were low (∼46% of the original-oil-in-place, OOIP) due to channeling through the top high-permeability region, leaving the bottom low-permeability region completely unswept. Foam flooding with an immiscible gas led to an improvement in sweep efficiency and resulted in an oil recovery as high as 80% OOIP. Foams stabilized by the surfactant-nanoparticle blend outperform surfactant-stabilized foams by 9% OOIP incremental oil. This study is the first-of-its-kind to visually demonstrate flow diversion due to nanoparticle-stabilized foam in a heterogeneous, porous system. Flow phenomena such as cross-flow between layers and foam phase separation are discussed. Complementary experiments such as static foam tests and confocal laser scanning microscopy are also performed to understand the effect of nanoparticles on foam stability. "

                    "abstract": "Shale oil production from plays such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford, driven by advances in horizontal well drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology, has helped improve US domestic oil production. However, due to the low permeability of shale oil reservoirs, primary depletion only produces 5–10% of the original oil in place and there is a huge potential for improved recovery. Chemical and gas huff-n-puff have been piloted with varying degrees of success, but no breakthrough recovery method has been discovered. This study examines improved oil recovery from shale reservoirs by thermal stimulation, consisting of primary depletion (early in a well's life), followed by conversion of the well to a heat injector to elevate reservoir temperature, and finally followed by a secondary depletion. The proposed method was tested using a compositional, thermal reservoir simulator (CMG STARS) and key parameters affecting recovery during thermal stimulation were investigated. This study found that 1000 days of thermal stimulation with a 700 °F heater has the potential to economically increase oil recovery from about 7% to more than 11.5%, with potential for even greater recovery if heat injection time and temperature are optimized. The study also found that thermal pressurization of oil is the primary mechanism for the improved recovery. Kerogen decomposition into oil and gas results in a significant increase of hydrocarbons in place but is only a minor contribution to the additional recovery because production is limited by a lack of flow capacity. Furthermore, a two-fold increase in permeability is observed as a result of kerogen decomposition, but its contribution to recovery is also minor because the heated region is not well connected with the fractured region. The heating scheme may be improved in the future to better connect the heated region with the fractured region. "

Compositional reservoir modeling was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed gas injection scheme. The computational domain consists of two hydrofrac half-stages along a horizontal well. The results show 15.7% and 12.5% OOIP incremental recovery over 5000 days of CO2 injection for the base models with the matrix permeability of 10 μD and 1 μD, respectively, demonstrating that the gas injection scheme has the potential to vastly improve oil recovery in oil-rich shale formations. The effects of reservoir properties and injection conditions on oil recovery were investigated by changing the injection pressure, reservoir heterogeneity, distribution of natural fractures, hydrofrac spacing, size of pore space, and compositions of the injection gas. Most of them affect the oil recovery significantly. Recovery by miscible hydrocarbon gas injection is comparable to CO2; so it should be considered as an alternative. "

                    "abstract": "Unstable floods and resulting viscous fingers remain a big challenge for reservoir simulation as the gridblock size is usually many orders larger than the viscous finger wavelength. This problem becomes especially pronounced with increasing applications of polymer and other chemical floods in the development of heavy oil reservoirs. Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the waterflood oil recovery. Using extremely fine grid models with centimeters size is unrealistic for field-scale simulations. While some researchers disregard viscous fingering by claiming that channeling dominates at the large scale for heterogeneous reservoirs, they miss the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. To overcome this limitation, an effective-fingering model was developed to upscale fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, single phase oil flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth rates of different regions, which are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history match of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved in the lab scale by considering homogeneous cores, and we extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatial accuracy numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using fine gridblock sizes roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number valid for a gridblock at the field scale affected by various heterogeneities using the effective-fingering model. We also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. We observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. In summary, we developed an upscaling model that provides a fresh-new insight on how to simulate unstable water/polymer floods at the field scale, which effectively accounts for the interplay of viscous fingering and channeling.

                    "abstract": "Conventional fractional flow theories such as the Buckley-Leverett analysis have benefited reservoir engineers greatly for many decades. Although being simple, these analyses provide prompt and decent estimations of water breakthrough and oil bank height/duration in the experiments and the fields. However, their intrinsic inaccuracy in estimating unstable immiscible floods due to the existence of viscous fingering has long been ignored. With increasing non-thermal immiscible floods developed for heavy oil reservoirs, an essential improvement for such a theory is desirable. The intrinsic residual oil saturation can never be achieved for strong unstable immiscible floods within a finite time. The fraction of the bypassed oil at a time is highly dependent on the viscosity ratio, flow velocity, interfacial tension, wettability, permeability and the geometry of the rock. Extensive experimental data and numerical studies have indicated that the strength and growth rate of viscous fingering are correlated to a dimensionless number, i.e., the viscous finger number, which is an integration of those factors aforementioned. Such a discovery enables a quantitative establishment of two-phase pseudo relative permeabilities, which are functions of fluid saturations and the viscous finger number. The fractional flow for unstable floods can hence be obtained by use of such pseudo relative permeabilities. The new fractional flow theory extended from the Buckley-Leverett analysis was applied to several groups of heavy-oil water coreflood experiments under various conditions. The new fractional flow analysis was able to predict very well the breakthrough time and oil recovery of these experiments. We further applied the new fractional flow analysis to a slab experiment of viscous oil with a waterflood followed by a polymer flood, and achieved a very good agreement with the oil recovery data. The analysis reproduced that the water cut increased very rapidly and the remaining oil saturation was much larger than the intrinsic residual oil saturation after several pore volumes of waterflood. The subsequent polymer flood altered the pseudo relative permeability curves due to the change of viscosity ratio and brought in a considerable amount of mobile oil to be displaced. This process happens to be similar to the fractional flow of low-tension immiscible flow. Such a scenario is different from what the conventional fractional flow analysis suggests, which neglects the fact that the subsequent polymer flood is able to greatly improve the oil cut by mitigating the viscous fingers originally created by waterflood. The new theory has extended the original fractional flow theories to unstable immiscible floods, a major progress. It can also serve as a critical guideline to estimate and predict the water/polymer breakthrough and the oil production in viscous-oil benchscale experiments and field projects. "

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding has been commercially applied to a number of viscous oil fields in the past decade and gradually gained more popularity. Due to limited injectivity in viscous-oil reservoirs, a relatively low polymer viscosity is usually used to avoid excessive injection pressure. In such a case, mobility ratio of polymer solution to oil is much greater than one, which implies unstable flow and strong viscous fingering. Existing reservoir simulators lack the capability of modeling such a physical phenomenon. Since many viscous-oil reservoirs have high permeability contrast between layers, we are motivated to study, for the first time, the impact of crossflow between different layers considering the presence of viscous fingering. Numerical modeling polymer floods with crossflow in a layered viscous-oil reservoir is difficult due to two major challenges: first is how to correctly allocate flow rates from the wellbore to multiple layers; and second is how to capture the viscous fingering effect without using excessively fine grids. To address the first issue, we developed an implicit well-rate-allocation model based on the potential method, which fully couples all the wellbore segments of each well with reservoir gridblocks to ensure a physical wellbore pressure. To deal with the second challenge, we implemented the effective fingering model, which is an upscaling model that lumps all the viscous fingers in a coarse grid block into one fictitious finger to allow for accurate estimation of fingering strength and growth during unstable flows. Both models were validated individually against the analytical solution or experimental data. The integrative module including the two new capabilities was used to simulate a polymer flood following a waterflood in a layer-cake reservoir in North America with moderate oil viscosity. We observed the fast propagation of water fronts and small fingering fraction in high permeability layers during the waterflooding phase, indicating active channeling and viscous fingering. The subsequent polymer flooding minimized both factors of oil bypassing and led to stable flow and high sweep efficiency. Without the implicit well-rate-allocation model, crossflow was overestimated and wellbore pressures of different well blocks were not consistent. Without the effective-fingering model, oil recovery was overestimated due to the lack of accounting for viscous fingering. The simulation results indicated that polymer flooding improved both displacement and sweep efficiencies. The model has shown comprehensive capabilities in reservoir simulations of polymer floods including unstable floods and crossflows between layers. This is a major significance to optimization of non-thermal viscous-oil EOR projects and also making more informed operational decisions for field developments. "

The scaling parameter showed excellent fit with experimental data of 68 corefloods. A lumped finger model was developed to modify multiphase flow equations and to yield pseudorelative permeability functions that account for viscous fingering.

                    "abstract": "The amount of synthetic surfactants required for a surfactant flood can be minimized by the addition of an alkali. An alkali reduces surfactant adsorption on sandstone and carbonate rocks, and generates in-situ surfactant with acidic crude oils. Many reservoirs, especially carbonates, contain gypsum (or anhydrite), which is sparingly soluble in water. In such cases, a conventional alkali such as sodium carbonate cannot be added to alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) formulations because it precipitates as CaCO3 on interacting with gypsum (or anhydrite). In this study, we test ammonia as an alkali to perform ASP floods in carbonate cores containing gypsum. The concentration of calcium ions in the presence of gypsum when ammonia is used as alkali can be as high as 2000 ppm, depending on the brine salinity and composition. Therefore, surfactant and polymer selection study was performed to identify suitable candidates under high calcium concentrations. Oil recovery experiments were performed in carbonate cores containing gypsum, using ammonia as the alkali. PHREEQC, the USGS geochemical simulator, was used for reactive transport modeling and was found to be an effective tool for designing these corefloods. High pH propagation and good oil recovery was observed in the ASP coreflood performed in a carbonate core containing gypsum. Addition of sodium sulfate in injection brines decreased gypsum dissolution. Gypsum dissolution was also lower at higher temperatures and lower NaCl concentrations. The surfactant retention in the ASP coreflood using ammonia, however, was found to be about the same as that of the SP coreflood, even though a high pH propagation was observed during the ASP coreflood. A good agreement was observed between the measured concentration of the effluent ions from the corefloods and the PHREEQC simulations. "

                    "abstract": "The upscaling of unstable immiscible flow remains an unsolved challenge for the oil industry. The absence of a reliable upscaling approach hinders effective reservoir simulation and optimization of heavy-oil recoveries by use of waterflood, polymer flood, and other chemical floods, which are inherently unstable processes. The difficulty in scaling up unstable flow lies in estimating the propagation of fingers smaller than the gridblock size. Using classical relative permeabilities obtained from stable flow analysis can lead to incorrect oil recovery and pressure drop in reservoir simulations. Extensive experimental data in water-wet cores indicate that the heavy-oil recovery by waterfloods and polymer floods has a power-law correlation with a dimensionless number (named “viscous-finger number” in this paper), a combination of viscosity ratio, capillary number, permeability, and the cross-sectional area of the core. On the basis of the features of unstable immiscible floods, an effective-fingering model is developed in this paper. A porous-medium domain is dynamically identified as three effective regions, which are two-phase flow, oil single-phase flow, and bypassed-oil region, respectively. Flow functions are derived according to effective flows in these regions. Model parameters represent viscous-fingering strength and growth rates. The new model is capable of history matching a set of heavy-oil waterflood corefloods under different conditions. Model parameters obtained from the history match also have power-law correlations with the viscous-finger number. This model is applicable to water-wet reservoirs; it has not been tested for mixed-wet and oil-wet systems, low-interfacial-tension (IFT) environments, low permeability, and heavy-oil reservoirs with free gas cap. In reservoir simulations, having such a correlation enables the estimation of model parameters in any gridblock of the reservoir by knowing the local viscous-finger number. The model was first applied to a heavy-oil field case with channelized permeability by waterfloods. Simulation results with the new model indicated that viscous fingering strengthened the channeling. Also, the new model shows that a lower injection rate leads to a higher oil recovery. In contrast, oil recovery in waterflooding of viscous oils is overpredicted by classical simulation methods that do not incorporate viscous fingering properly. We further showed that coarse grid simulations with the new model were able to obtain saturation and pressure maps consistent with fine-grid simulations. The new model was then used to model a real field case in the Pelican Lake heavy-oil field. It was able to match the field-production data without major adjustment of reservoir/fluid properties from the literature, showing its competence in capturing subgrid viscous-fingering effects. Overall, the new model shows encouraging capability to simulate unstable water and polymer floods in heavy-oil reservoirs, and hence can facilitate the optimization of heavy-oil enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) projects.

                    "abstract": "With the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs, stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have received greater attention in recent years. The post-fracture productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix/fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity. Although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that production increases with the proppant amount injected. This paper presents an approach to assess the proppant amount injected by determining the optimum post-fracture conductivity. First, through use of 3D finite-difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete gridblocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity. For a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity. The critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time. The numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time. The effect of stimulated natural-fracture properties (spacing and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated. For reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range of 20 to 1,000 nd, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity, but decrease the medium- to long-term conductivity. The paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and flowing bottomhole pressure (BHP) on the critical conductivity. This study demonstrates that fracture designs that are based on pseudosteady-state solutions are not appropriate for naturally fractured shale reservoirs and can lead to significantly lower initial production. Considering conductivity degradation over time, fracture designs that target achieving 1-year critical conductivity are recommended. A simple, yet robust workflow that is based on knowledge of 1-year critical conductivity is also presented for systematically selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation treatment. Such a workflow can mitigate trial-and-error-based and data-driven approaches in the industry. An example is demonstrated for the Marcellus play. "

A large fraction of the fractured area is not usually propped due to the high density of typical proppants (sand) and low viscosity of the fracturing fluid. The goal of this work is to understand and optimize proppant transport in complex fracture networks. In this paper, proppant transport in fracture intersections is studied experimentally (using laboratory size slots) and numerically (using a multiphase dense discrete phase model). The orientation of natural fractures, proppant size and shear rate have been varied and the injected proppant volume is kept constant. Both experiments and simulations show three zones: bottom immobile sand bed zone, middle flowing slurry zone, and top clear fluid zone. The sand injected early forms the bottom of the sand bed; the sand injected later moves downstream and forms the top part of the bed. The entrance eroded region increases as the shear rate (or equivalently the water injection rate) increases. The sand bed length increases as the shear rate increases. The equilibrium sand bed height decreases as the shear rate increases and the sand size decreases. Proppant placement in the bypass slot increases as the shear rate increases and the bypass angle decreases. The numerical model using a dense discrete phase model (DDPM) captures the key features of the sand bed formation and transport. "

In this study, the core scale manifestation of these mechanisms is evaluated, and a geochemical model is developed for further insight into reaction pathways. Brines of different compositions were injected into carbonate cores with no oil and the effluent was analyzed for ionic composition. Seawater, sulfate-rich seawater, and dilutions of seawater were tested. Two phase oil displacement core floods were performed for the same brine cases to correlate the oil recovery to the geochemistry. A mechanistic model was developed using our in-house reservoir simulator UTCHEM-IPHREEQC for the wettability alteration process. The single phase core floods with all test brines indicate retention of SO42- within the core, seen by a delay in its effluent concentration reaching the injection concentration. Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cl- ions mostly behave as tracers in the system. In oil displacement core floods, formation brine recovers 40% OOIP on average and seawater recovers an incremental 7% OOIP. Sulfate-rich seawater and dilutions of seawater increase the recovery to 65-80% OOIP in secondary and tertiary modes, requiring more than 5 PVI. SO42- ion delay is not observed in the two phase core floods. Ca2+ concentrations remain high after 5 PVI of diluted seawater, indicating a slow dissolution process in the low salinity floods. The mechanistic model results were in good agreement with the single phase coreflood experiments and oil recovery experiments. The model showed that the reduction in surface concentration of naphthenic acids was responsible for altering the wettability on the injection of modified brines. "

The surfactant systems were first tested in outcrop cores. The cumulative oil recovery was not very high (below 90% OOIP) initially. The surfactant system was modified again to achieve a negative slope in the activity diagram; the preflush was modified to not have any alkali. These modifications were tried first in the field core with the simulated live oil and the oil recovery was very high (98% OOIP). The same formulation was then tested in the field core with the live oil and the cumulative oil recovery was 95% OOIP. The pressure gradients were reasonable and adsorption was low. This study showed that sodium carbonate can be used in an ASP formulation in a field brine if enough EDTA can be added to sequester the divalent ions. The ASP formulation should be such that the optimal salinity (and the three-phase salinity range) should increase with water-oil-ratio.

After secondary waterfloods, surfactant solutions were coinjected with methane gas at a fixed foam quality (gas-volume fraction). Contact-angle and spontaneous-imbibition experiments showed that AOS can act as a wettability-altering surfactant in the presence of sodium carbonate, but not alone. No synergy was observed in foam stabilization by means of the blend of zwitterionic surfactant and AOS solution (1:1) in a water-wet carbonate core. Oil-displacement experiments in oil-wet carbonate core revealed that coinjection of wettability-altering surfactant and gas can recover a significant amount of oil [33% original oil in place (OOIP)] over waterflood. During foam flooding, with AOS as the foaming agent, only a weak foam was propagated in a carbonate core, irrespective of the core wettability. A blend of wettability-altering surfactant, AOS, and zwitterionic surfactant not only altered the wettability of carbonate core from oil-wet to water-wet, but also significantly increased the foam-pressure gradient in the presence of crude oil.

An ACP formulation was developed by studying the phase behavior of the oil with several alkaline-cosolvent formulations. The effectiveness of the ACP formulation was validated in a 1D sand pack by conducting a waterflood followed by a stable ACP flood. Sand was then packed into a 2D square steel cell equivalent to a quarter five-spot pattern. Several ACP floods were then conducted in this 2D cell to study both the displacement and sweep efficiency of ACP floods. First, the polymer concentration in the ACP formulation was varied to find an optimum ACP slug viscosity where the oil recovery and pressure gradients are acceptable. When the ACP slug viscosity was about 1/4 of the oil viscosity, oil recovery was 76% OOIP; we adopted this viscosity as the optimum viscosity. Then, using this ACP slug viscosity, the waterflood extent, after which the ACP flood was initiated, was varied (0-1 pore volume). The oil recovery, oil cut, effluent concentration and pressure drop were monitored during the floods. The timing of the tertiary flood did not change the tertiary oil recovery very much. However, shorter the waterflood, faster was the oil recovery under the constant injection rate constraint. Sweep efficiency during secondary ACP flood was lower than that in the tertiary ACP injection. Gravity effect on sweep was significant under ultralow IFT. "

However, foams have to overcome two adverse conditions in carbonates: oil-wettability and low permeability. This study evaluates several foam formulations that combine wettability alteration and foaming in low permeability oil-wet carbonate cores. Contact angle experiments were performed on oil-wet calcite plates to evaluate the wettability altering capabilities of the surfactant formulations. Static foam stability tests were conducted to evaluate their foaming performance in bulk. Finally, oil displacement experiments were performed using Texas Cream and Estaillades Limestone cores with crude oil. Two different injection strategies were studied in this work: alternating gas-surfactant-gas injection and co-injection of wettability alteration surfactant with gas at a constant foam quality. Cationic surfactants DTAB and BTC altered the wettability of the oil-wet calcite plate to water-wet, but were ineffective in forming foam. The addition of a non-ionic surfactant Tergitol NP helped in the foaming ability of these formulations. In-house developed Gemini cationic surfactant GC 580 was able to alter the wettability from oil-wet to water-wet and also formed strong bulk foam. Static foam tests showed increase in bulk foam stability with the addition of zwitterionic surfactants to GC 580. Oil displacement experiments in oil-wet carbonate cores revealed that tertiary oil-recovery with injection of a wettability-altering surfactant can recover a significant amount of oil (about 20–25% OOIP) over the secondary water flood and gas flood. The foam rheology in the presence of oil suggested propagation of only weak foam in oil-wet low permeability carbonate cores. "

The 2D tertiary ASP flood also recovered most of the oil (~98% of OOIP) when the ASP slug viscosity exceeded the oil viscosity, but the pressure gradients were high at ~ 1ft/d injection. When the ASP slug viscosity was lowered to ~1/3 of oil viscosity, oil recovery dropped slightly to 90% OOIP. However, it also decreased the pressure gradient 5 times, which would give good flow rates in the field conditions. As the extent of waterflood preceding ASP got shorter, the oil was recovered faster (for the same pore volumes injected), but the pressure gradient was higher for the ASP flood than the water flood.

The swelling of the particles is independent of pH in the range of 2 to 12.6. The swelling process is reversible with salinity. These particles are stable at 60 °C for at least several months. Core flood results show that these small particles can be transported through fractures during high salinity brine injection and plug the fractures during low salinity brine injection.

Zeta potential measurements showed a reduction in zeta potential of Bandera brown and Silurian dolomite by adding ammonia to increase the pH. Surfactant adsorption experiments showed that ammonia was able to reduce the adsorption on sandstones, but not much difference was observed for carbonates.

                    "abstract": "Upscaling of unstable immiscible flow remains an unsolved challenge for the oil industry. The absence of a reliable upscaling approach greatly hinders the effective reservoir simulation and optimization of heavy oil recoveries using waterflood, polymer flood and other chemical floods, which are inherently unstable processes. The difficulty in upscaling unstable flow lies in estimating the propagation of fingers smaller than the gridblock size. Using classical relative permeabilities obtained from stable flow analysis can lead to incorrect oil recovery and pressure drop in reservoir simulations. In a recent study based on abundant experimental data, it is found that the heavy-oil recovery by waterfloods and polymer floods has a power-law correlation with a dimensionless number (named viscous finger number in this paper), which is a combination of viscosity ratio, capillary number, permeability, and the cross-section area of the core. Based upon this important finding as well as the features of unstable immiscible floods, an effective-finger model is developed in this paper. A porous medium domain is dynamically identified as three effective zones, which are two-phase flow zone, oil single-phase flow zone, and bypassed oil (isolated oil island) zone, respectively. Flow functions are derived according to effective flows in these zones. This new model is capable of history-matching a set of heavy-oil waterflood corefloods under different viscosity ratios and injection rates. Model parameters obtained from the history match also have a power-law correlation with the viscous finger number. The build-up of this correlation contains reasonable physical meanings to quantitatively characterize the upscaled behavior of viscous fingering effects. Having such a correlation enables the estimation of model parameters in any gridblock of the reservoir by knowing the local viscous finger number in reservoir simulations. The model is applied to several heavy-oil field cases with waterfloods and polymer floods with different heterogeneities. Oil recovery in water flooding of viscous oils is overpredicted by classical simulation methods which do not incorporate viscous fingering properly. Simulation results indicate that the new model reasonably differentiates the oil recoveries at different viscous finger numbers, e.g., lower injection rate leads to higher oil recovery. In contrast, classical simulations obtain close oil recoveries under different injection rates or degrees of polymer shear-thinning, which is apparently incorrect for unstable floods. Moreover, coarse-grid simulations using the new model are able to obtain consistent saturation and pressure maps with fine-grid simulations when the correlation lengths are not smaller than the coarse gridblock size. Furthermore, it is well captured by the model that the shear-shinning polymer solution can strengthen the fingering in high-permeability regions due to increased capillary number and viscosity ratio, which is not observed in waterflood. As a whole, the new model shows encouraging capability to simulate unstable water and polymer floods in heavy oil reservoirs, and hence can facilitate the optimization of heavy-oil EOR projects. "

The goal of this work is to study foam stabilization by nanoparticles—in particular, by in-situ surface hydrophobization of hydrophilic nanoparticles. The interfacial properties of the nanoparticles were modulated by the attachment of short-chain surface modifiers (alkyl gallates) that render them partially hydrophobic, but still fully dispersible in water. First, static foams were generated with nanoparticles with varying concentrations of surface modifiers. The decay of foam height with time was measured, and half-lives were determined. Optical micrographs of foam stabilized by surface-modified nanoparticles (SMNPs) and surfactant were recorded. Second, aqueous foams were created in-situ by coinjecting the SMNP solutions with nitrogen gas through a Berea sandstone core at a fixed quality. Pressure drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved resistance factor. These pressure-drop results were then compared with those of a typical surfactant (alpha olefin sulfonate, alkyl polyglucoside) under similar conditions. Finally, oil-displacement experiments were conducted in Berea cores with surfactant and SMNP solutions as foaming agents (coinjection with nitrogen gas). A Bartsch shake test revealed the strong foaming tendency of SMNPs even with a very low initial surface-modifier concentration (0.05 wt%), whereas hydrophilic nanoparticles alone could not stabilize foam. The bubble texture of foam stabilized by SMNPs was finer than that with surfactants, indicating a stronger foam. As the degree of surface coating increased, the resistance factor of SMNP foam in a Berea core increased significantly. The corefloods in the sandstone cores with a reservoir crude oil showed that immiscible foams with SMNP solution can recover a significant amount of oil (20.6% of original oil in place) over waterfloods.

The fly ash samples containing carbonaceous material produced more emulsion phases with denser structures. It was difficult to generate stable CO2 foams without additives.

Polymer-free aqueous foams can be used in shale fracturing because of their capacity to suspend proppants and lower water consumption than commonly used water-based fracturing fluids. In this work, the rheology of three kinds of polymer-free foams (A: 0.5 wt% regular anionic surfactant, B: Fluid A+2 wt% glycerol, C: 0.5 wt% viscoelastic surfactant or VES) are studied in a recirculating pipe rheometer up to 155 °F and 2000 psi. These temperature and pressure conditions are lower than those for typical shales of current interest. All three foams exhibit power-law rheological behavior. The regular surfactant foams (A and B) show shear thinning behavior at qualities above 60%, non-shear dependent behavior from 50% to 60% and shear thickening below 50% (due to turbulence). The VES foams show shear thinning at qualities less than 60%. Temperature lowers the viscosity of foams by decreasing the liquid phase viscosity and the stability of the bubbles, but the temperature effect is small for foams A and B. Pressure increases foam viscosity; the increase is higher for higher quality foams. As the pressure increases, the rate of viscosity increase decreases. The aqueous foams A and B are both less viscous than typical guar foams (0.24 wt% polymer), while the VES foam C has a similar viscosity. The model proposed by Brouwers (2010) for suspensions agrees the best with the measured data for quality under 60%; the model proposed by Princen and Kiss (1989) for high quality does not match the experimental data. New correlations have been developed to describe the aqueous foam rheology as a function of shear rate, quality, and pressure at the parameter range typical of hydraulic fracturing. The correlations can be incorporated in a fracture propagation simulator to evaluate the foam fracturing efficiency. "

The ultra-low permeability of shale makes injection from well to well difficult; thus it is proposed that gas is injected into a hydraulic fracture along a horizontal well and production occurs from an adjacent fracture, intersecting the same well. Compositional reservoir modeling was performed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed gas injection scheme. The computational domain consists of two hydrofrac half-stages along a horizontal well to capture detailed information of the fluid flow near the well bore. The results show 15.7% OOIP incremental recovery for the base model with matrix permeability kmatrix = 10 µD over 5000 days (nearly 14 years) of CO2 injection, and 12.5% OOIP for the one with kmatrix = 1 µD, indicating that the gas injection scheme has the potential to vastly improve oil recovery in oil-rich shale formations. The effects of reservoir properties and injection conditions on oil recovery were investigated by changing the injection pressure, reservoir heterogeneity, hydrofrac spacing, dispersion, and compositions of the injection gas. Increasing injection pressure leads to higher production before breakthrough and faster recovery of the oil in the stimulated region. Reducing the hydrofrac spacing has similar effect, although the production declines more rapidly after breakthrough. Introducing heterogeneity to the reservoir results in lower recovery, but the effect of spatial continuity (correlation length) on recovery is insignificant. It was also found that dispersion is mainly dominated by diffusion and mechanical dispersion is less important in most cases. Injection of hydrocarbon gas outperforms CO2, especially if the economics is also taken into account. "

First, as the grain size of fly ash is generally too large for injection into reservoirs, it was reduced to nano-size by the ball-milling process. Second, dispersion stability analysis was performed to evaluate a suitable dispersing agent for fly ash nanoparticles (FA-NP). A range of surfactants (anionic, cationic, and non-ionic) was used in dilute concentrations. Surfactants were screened based on particle-hydrodynamic diameters and polydispersity index of the dispersion as measured by dynamic light scattering. Third, foam flow experiments were performed using combinations of FA-NP and various surfactants. Aqueous foam was created in-situ by coinjecting the FA-NP and/or surfactants with liquid CO2 through a sandpack at a fixed foam quality. Foam texture, as seen in the view-cell, was used to screen suitable surfactants that stabilized strong foams. Finally, the foam flow experiments were conducted in a Berea sandstone core. Pressure drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved foam resistance factor and the apparent viscosity of the generated foam. Nano-milling and thermal treatment processes were able to yield thermally-treated fly ash (TTFA) nanoparticles with an average size of 180 nm. Dispersion stability analysis revealed that anionic and non-ionic surfactants are suitable in dispersing these nanoparticles. Foam texture visualization demonstrated that strong carbon dioxide-in-water foam/emulsion with fine texture can be generated using TTFA nanoparticles in porous media in conjunction with a non-ionic surfactant or an anionic surfactant in dilute concentrations. Foam flow experiments in a Berea core showed that TTFA nanoparticles even in low concentrations (0.4 wt%) can significantly improve the foam stability and foam resistance factor of an anionic surfactant (in the absence of oil). Antagonistic effects were observed in foam stability in Berea core by addition of TTFA nanoparticles to nonionic surfactants. This study has the potential of not only to minimize the surfactant usage for foam-based CO2 EOR mobility control, but also to sequester both CO2 and fly ash in subsurface formations. "

                    "abstract": "Horizontal wells with long propped fractures are needed to maximize productivity for ultra-low permeability shale and tight reservoirs. Conventional slickwater fracturing with sand can produce long fractures, but only the near wellbore region is propped due to fast settling of sand in water. Ultra-light weight proppants (ULWPs) can be used to reduce proppant settling. A comprehensive investigation of ULWP performance in shale reservoirs has been conducted by utilizing fracture conductivity experiments, fracture modeling and reservoir simulation. Based on experimental fracture conductivity measurements, empirical conductivity correlations are developed for the three ULWPs as a function of proppant areal concentration at reservoir confining stress and temperature. A fracturing model is used to predict the proppant concentration distributions during fracturing operations from which conductivity distribution along fractures is estimated. The conductivity distribution is then put into a reservoir simulator to predict gas production from a fractured shale well. Simulation study shows that at the same injection concentration in slickwater, all three ULWPs create more propped area and longer propped distance than sand, but the fracture conductivity is significantly lower. ULWPs have strong productivity advantages over sand in 0.1 μD gas reservoir by creating more propped areas. The productivity advantage of using ULWPs decreases with increasing reservoir permeability and decreasing production time. For 1 year production and 0.1 μD shale reservoirs, the acceptable maximum price is $10/lb for ULW-1, $6/lb for ULW-2, and $2.5/lb for ULW-3. The maximum price increases as production time increases. By adding small amount of ULWPs into sand, both the high conductivity zone at the bottom and low conductivity zone at the upper and deeper zones can be achieved, which benefits both short and long-term production.

                    "abstract": "A numerical reservoir model was created to optimize Huff-and-Puff operations in the Bakken Shale. Huff-and-Puff is an enhanced oil recovery method in which a well alternates between injection, soaking, and production. Injecting CO2 (or other gases) into the formation and allowing it to “soak” re-pressurizes the reservoir and improves oil mobility, boosting production from the well. A compositional reservoir simulator (CMG GEM) was used to study various design components of the Huff-and-Puff process in order to identify the parameters with the largest impact on recovery and understand the reservoir’s response to cyclical gas injection. It was found that starting Huff-and-Puff too early in the life of the well diminishes its effectiveness, and that shorter soaking periods are preferable over longer waiting times. Huff-and-Puff works best in reservoirs with highly-conductive natural fracture networks, which allow CO2 to migrate deep into the formation and mix with the reservoir fluids. Doubling the number of hydraulic fractures per stage results in considerably greater gas injection requirements without proportionally larger incremental recovery factors. Incremental recovery from CO2 Huff-and-Puff appears to be insufficient to make the process commercially feasible under current economic conditions. However, re-injecting mixtures of CO2 and produced hydrocarbon gases was shown to be technically and economically viable, and could significantly improve profit margins of Huff-and-Puff operations.

                    "abstract": "The performance of surfactant-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in fractured carbonates relies on spontaneous imbibition or low IFT-aided gravity drainage. This work investigated the synergism between wettability effects and IFT reduction mediated by a variety of surfactants through experiments and numerical simulation studies. Experiments have shown that oil can be recovered from oil-wet Silurian dolomite fracture blocks either by capillarity driven imbibition, gravity-driven imbibition or low tension-aided gravity drainage. The mixture of wettability alteration (WA) surfacant with IFT reduction surfactant exhibits the synergistic effect on the imbibition oil recovery from oil-wet carbonate rocks. It was found that divalent ion scavengers help the wettability altertion capability of some sulfonate surfactants in hard brine, which leads to the high oil recovery up to 70% OOIP (IFT+WA), compared with oil recovery of 30-50% OOIP by sulfonate surfactant only (only IFT reduction). We proposed a mechanism that the presence of a sufficient amount of divalent ion scavengers in the anionic surfactant formulation reduces the free divalent cations in hard brine, which then promotes the release of surfactant monomers from the micelles and enhances wettability alteration by surfactant adsorption. The UTCHEM simulation results confirmed the existence of synergism between IFT reduction and WA in spontaneous imbibition processes. According to the capillary desaturation curve (CDC), that residual oil saturation after gravity drainage is approximately 10% to 20% higher than gravity-driven spontaneous imbibition when two processes have the similar trapping numbers, confirming that the wettability alteration contributes to the ultimate oil recovery.

                    "abstract": "Oil recovery from fractured carbonate reservoirs by water flooding is often inefficient due to the commonly oil-wet nature of these rocks and the lack of sufficient spontaneous capillary imbibition driving force to push oil out from the matrix to the fracture network. Chemical processes such as surfactant/alkali-induced wettability alteration and interfacial tension (IFT) reduction have shown great potential to reduce the residual oil saturation in matrix blocks, leading to significant incremental oil recovery (IOR). However, the time required to achieve a significant amount of oil recovery is the most crucial deciding factor in field projects. The magnitude of recovery and response time of any chemical process depends on the degree of wettability alteration and IFT reduction, the nature and density of fracture network, and the matrix block size. Oil recovery experiments were performed for the same matrix rock and chemical formulation, but for different sized cores to gain a better understanding of the time dependence of the recovery process. The measured oil recoveries were history-matched. The simulation models were then used to predict the recovery response times for larger cores. The controlled and systematic laboratory measurements for several core sizes helped in developing dimensionless scaling groups to aid in understanding the time dependence and the upscaling of laboratory results to field-scale applications. This finding is significant as it illustrates the extent of wettability alteration and IFT reduction needed in fractured reservoirs. Laboratory measurements and simulation work substantiate the validity and the range of applicability of upscaled procedures and indicate the importance of viscous and buoyancy forces in larger field cases. The results of this work will be useful for the design of future field projects. "

                    "abstract": "Water floods are often very inefficient in naturally fractured carbonate oil reservoirs because many of these reservoirs are mixed-wet or oil-wet as well as extremely heterogeneous. Naturally fractured reservoirs are challenging targets for chemical flooding because they typically have a high permeability contrast between the fractures and the matrix with a low matrix permeability. Some of the world׳s largest oil reservoirs are fractured carbonates with a high reservoir temperature and a high salinity formation brine. Some of them also have low API gravity oils, which also increases the difficulty of recovering the oil. A surfactant formulation has been developed that shows promising results for such difficult reservoirs. Ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) and good aqueous stability were achieved with this new carboxylate surfactant in a hard brine at a high reservoir temperature of 100 °C. Both static and dynamic imbibition experiments were conducted using a fractured carbonate core. 65.9% Oil recovery was obtained in fractured coreflood compared to 33.3% oil recovery in static imbibition test. The surfactant retention was low at 0.086 mg/g of rock. The oil recovery is excellent taking into account that the temperature and salinity conditions were harsh, the core was extremely vuggy and fractured, no mobility control was used, and only a small surfactant slug was injected. The coreflood results were interpreted using a mechanistic chemical reservoir simulator. It showed that both the mechanisms of IFT reduction and wettability alteration were important for oil recovery. Neither IFT reduction nor wettability alteration alone recovered oil as high as the combined contributions from both. "

The interfacial properties of the nanoparticles were modulated by attachment of short chain surface modifiers which render them partially hydrophobic. Static foams were generated using nanoparticles with varying concentrations of surface modifiers. The decay of foam height with time was studied and half-lives were determined. Optical micrographs of foams stabilized by surface-modified nanoparticles (SM-NP) and surfactants were recorded. Aqueous foams were created in-situ by co-injecting the SM-NP solutions with nitrogen gas through a Berea sandstone core at a fixed quality. Pressure drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved mobility reduction factor (MRF). The results were then compared with a typical surfactant under similar conditions. Oil displacement experiments were conducted in Berea cores using surfactant and SM-NP solutions as foaming agents. Bartsch shake test revealed strong foaming tendency of SM-NP even with a very low initial surface-modifier concentration (0.05 wt%), whereas hydrophilic nanoparticles alone could not stabilize foam. The bubble texture of foam stabilized by SM-NP was finer than that with surfactant which indicated a stronger foam. As the degree of surface coating increased, mobility reduction factor (MRF) of SM-NP foam in a Berea core increased significantly. The core floods in the sandstone cores with a reservoir crude oil showed that immiscible foams using SM-NP solution can recover significant amount of oil over water flood. Introduction With the surging energy demand and consumption globally, there is an inevitable need to exploit the existing oil reserves efficiently. Pressure depletion (primary), water flooding, and gas drainage (secondary) are the common techniques that are employed to recover oil, but more than half of the original oil is still left behind in reservoirs (Mohanty, 2003). Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques like miscible gas injection, chemical flooding, and thermal recovery are being developed to recover the residual oil. Gas flooding is one of the most accepted and widely applied EOR method (Orr, 2007). It comprises injection of hydrocarbon components like methane, propane and enriched-gases, and non-hydrocarbon components like carbon dioxide (primarily), nitrogen and flue gas into oil reservoirs that have been typically waterflooded. CO2 flooding is now quite environmentally and economically feasible due to current high oil prices and availability of large anthropogenic CO2 sources through carbon capture (Enick et al., 2012). In principle, gas flooding is quite effective in improving microscopic sweep efficiency (Lake, 1989). In fact, if the gas is first or multicontact miscible with the oil, it can displace virtually all the oil in the volume swept by the gas (Orr et al., 1982). However, the volumetric sweep efficiency of gas flood is often very poor due to reservoir heterogeneity, gravity segregation, and viscous instability. "

                    "abstract": "In alkali surfactant polymer (ASP) floods, alkali reduces surfactant adsorption and forms in situ surfactant with active oils, thus reducing synthetic surfactant requirement. Many reservoirs, especially carbonates, contain gypsum or anhydrite. In such cases, a conventional alkali like sodium carbonate cannot be used in ASP formulations because it precipitates as calcite.  However, it was found that the calcium concentration in the presence of gypsum can be as high as 2000 ppm without causing any precipitation when ammonia is used as the alkali.   Ultralow IFT surfactant formulations were obtained in the presence of up to 1200 ppm Ca2+. Propagation of high pH, good oil recovery and low surfactant retention were observed in an ASP coreflood performed in a carbonate core containing gypsum. The Phreeqc geochemical simulator was used for reactive transport modeling and was found to be an effective tool for designing these corefloods.  A good match was observed between the measured concentration of the effluent ions from a coreflood experiment and the Phreeqc simulations. Introduction After primary and secondary recovery in oil reservoirs, a large amount of residual oil is unrecovered due to trapping in the pores of the reservoir rock by capillary forces. Surfactants are able to mobilize this trapped oil by lowering the interfacial tension.  Surfactants are retained in the reservoir by various mechanisms such as adsorption on mineral surfaces and phase trapping (Solairaj et al., 2012). Since a limited amount of surfactant can be used for an economical flood, the surfactant retention needs to be minimized. One of the ways of doing this is by incorporating an alkali into the surfactant formulation to increase the pH, which reduces the adsorption of anionic surfactants by making the surface charge negative (Somasundaran, 1979; Hirasaki et al., 2008). Alkali also helps in minimizing the amount of surfactant needed for oils that contain organic acids by generating soap. Many carbonate reservoirs contain either gypsum or anhydrite. Levitt et al. (2011) discuss various challenges encountered in the application of chemical EOR in carbonate reservoirs, especially in the presence of gypsum. Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) or anhydrite (CaSO4) differ in the water of hydration. The transition from gypsum to anhydrite takes place around 45 °C. Gypsum (or anhydrite depending on the temperature, but for convenience we refer to gypsum unless we are describing a specific instance of anhydrite) is commonly present in carbonate reservoirs, especially dolomite formations as well as some sandstones, but it is less common in sandstone reservoirs. Under these circumstances, a conventional alkali such as sodium carbonate cannot be used because of precipitation of calcite by the reaction, "

                    "abstract": "With the development of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs, stimulation treatments that place multiple transverse fractures have received a greater attention in recent years. The post-frac productivity of such low-permeability reservoirs is largely determined by the matrix-fracture contact area with appropriate fracture conductivity. Although it is often anticipated that the fractures are infinitely conductive, the general belief is that the production increases with the proppant amount injected. This paper presents an approach to assess the optimum proppant amount injected by determining the post-frac conductivity. First, using three-dimensional finite difference reservoir simulations in a naturally fractured reservoir, which has both the hydraulic fracture and natural fractures modeled explicitly as discrete grid blocks, we find cumulative production as a function of fracture conductivity. For a fixed propped length and production time, we observe a critical conductivity beyond which the production is insensitive to the conductivity. The critical conductivity is then obtained as a function of the propped length and production time. The numerical results show that the critical conductivity increases with propped length and decreases with production time. The effect of stimulated natural fracture properties (intensity and permeability) on the critical conductivity is then investigated. For reservoirs with matrix permeability in the range 20-1000 nD, natural fractures increase the short-term critical conductivity but decrease the medium to long-term ones. The paper also evaluates the influence of water production, cluster spacing, and BHP flowing pressure on the critical conductivity. This study demonstrates that Agarwal type curves based on linear flow are not appropriate for naturally fractured reservoirs and lead to errors in estimation of critical conductivity. The results of this study can be useful for selecting the type and amount of proppant for stimulation of unconventional reservoirs. Introduction Recent advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enabled economic production from North American shale and tight reservoirs. These include multi-stage fracturing using plug-and-perf method, use of slickwater as fracturing fluid and various completion tools. Due to low recovery factors and fast declining rates, well productivity in such low-permeability reservoirs is driven by the stimulation effectiveness to create a large matrix-fracture contact area. Therefore, optimizing the completions parameters (stage spacing, proppant and fluid type, open-hole vs. cemented etc.) has become an integral part of the field-development program. Shale reservoirs are complex, heterogeneous and often characterized by the presence of natural fractures, faults and planes of weakness. The interactions between hydraulic and natural fractures can lead to non-planar, complex fracture growths. However, such network growth is not fully understood and the field validation has been challenging. Although microseismic measurements have provided some insight into the complex fracture network growth (King 2010), microseimics can only capture a small portion of rock deformation and cannot provide any information about proppant and conductivity distribution (Cipolla and Wallace, 2014). Diagnostic tools such as production logs, fiber optics, tracers etc. are often qualitative and severely limited by non-uniqueness of the interpretation. In addition, the accuracy of current fracture models to simulate the network fracture growth is limited to only 2D (McClure 2014) and pseudo-3D models (Weng et al., 2011; Meyer et al. 2013). All these factors have made completion engineers to choose the optimization parameters based on ad-hoc, trial-and-error approaches. "

A numerical model of fracture propagation is developed which incorporates a 2D fracture model, proppant transport, and foam rheology. The fracture conductivity distribution is computed from the local proppant concentration, which is incorporated in a reservoir simulation model to predict the gas production by depressurization. Given the rock mechanical properties, the fracturing fluid, proppants, and rock permeability control the shape and conductivity of the fractures created during hydraulic fracturing. The shape and conductivity of the fracture, in turn, control the gas productivity of such a well. Foam quality, proppant size, proppant concentration, and rock permeability are varied. The results show that, in most cases, the gas production is optimum at an intermediate foam quality (of about 65%) because it creates the largest propped fracture area and minimizes leak-off. Only for the case of 0.1 micro-Darcy rock, low proppant concentration and large proppant size, the gas production increases monotonically with foam quality because high quality foam can place a partial monolayer of proppants. Fracturing with water as the initial pad and a high quality (65–85%) foam as the proppant carrier is more effective than using the same foam for both pad and slurry. "

Nonaqueous components are carefully lumped into seven pseudocomponents. Permeability fields with various heterogeneity and correlation lengths are generated. UT-COMP is able to solve the compositional model, despite the permeability difference between the fracture and matrix being six orders of magnitude. The effects of both primary recovery and CO2 huff 'n' puff recovery depend significantly on reservoir heterogeneity. In primary recovery, the recovery factor can be fit by a two-parameter exponential formula; higher heterogeneity reduces the rate coefficient in the formula. Permeability fields with identical or similar heterogeneity have similar rate coefficients, even if the correlation lengths are different, which implies that the recovery depends primarily on heterogeneity and is insensitive to correlation length. Multiple-cycle CO2 huff 'n' puff processes are simulated in both homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. Recovery rate in the production stage rises to a peak value much higher than that in the primary recovery, and then declines dramatically. The peak recovery rate decreases with increasing huff 'n' puff cycles, resulting from depleted reservoir pressure and hydrocarbons. The final recovery factor in the huff 'n' puff recovery is lower than that in the primary recovery, because the incremental recovery in the production stage is unable to compensate the loss in the injection and shut-in stages. Use of a longer shut-in time does not help increase the recovery rate in the production stage, because CO2 migration into the shale matrix is very limited because of the low matrix permeability. Reservoir heterogeneity leads to a faster decline of recovery rate in the production stage. "

The use of sodium metaborate was investigated as a possible solution to this problem. We measured the interaction and transport of sodium metaborate in sandstone and carbonate cores containing gypsum or anhydrite. First static experiments were performed with sodium metaborate in the presence of excess anhydrite for more than one month. Then single-phase dynamic core flood experiments were performed with both sodium carbonate and sodium metaborate at different injection rates and concentrations in cores containing anhydrite. Effluent pH and ion concentrations including boron, calcium and sulfate were measured using an ion chromatograph (IC) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Finally, ASP corefloods were performed in reservoir cores containing anhydrite at 1 ft/day and 0.25 ft/day to determine the effect of residence time.  Sodium metaborate was found to maintain a high pH of more than 10 in the batch samples for more than a month while sodium carbonate pH dropped to low values within a day. The effluent sulfate concentrations (or anhydrite dissolution) in the dynamic experiments were dependent on the alkali injection rates, concentrations and salinity. The residence times in these experiments were therefore increased up to 15 days, corresponding to a frontal velocity of 1/15 ft/day. The effluent sulfate increased from about 1000 ppm at 1ft/day to an apparent equilibrium value of about 5000 ppm at 1/15 ft/day, indicating the importance of the kinetics when scaling up from a core flood to a reservoir flood. Sodium metaborate was able to propagate a pH of 10 (even at 1/15 ft/day), making it suitable for ASP flooding, without significant changes in permeability or anhydrite dissolution. Oil recoveries of more than 90% of the water flood residual oil were obtained in the ASP corefloods along with very low surfactant retention due to the high pH. The permeability changes in these experiments were negligible. An ASP process has been developed for rocks containing gypsum or anhydrite. "

                    "title": "Polymer Flood of Viscous Oils in Complex Carbonates",
                    "abstract": "Application: Some of the viscous oil reserves are in carbonate rocks and thermal methods in carbonate formations are complicated by mineral dissolution and re-precipitation. Simple non-thermal methods such as polymer floods should be developed for viscous oils in carbonates. The goal of this work is to identify the optimal viscosity and timing of polymer injection. Description of the material: In this study, vuggy Silurian dolomite cores were saturated with a formation brine and a reservoir oil (150-200 cp). They were then displaced by a polymeric solution either in the secondary mode or in the tertiary mode. The effect of timing of polymer injection and polymer concentration is studied. These experiments were repeated for oil-wet dolomite and water-wet Berea cores for comparison. Complimentary pore scale investigation was conducted using 2D homogeneous and heterogeneous glass micromodels. Isolated and connected heterogeneities were introduced in the micromodel to mimic the vugs and fractures typical of dolomite reservoirs. A series of water flood and polymer flood were conducted. Results: It was observed that the polymer solution viscosity can be at least five times lower than the oil viscosity for stable floods. Typically, a tertiary polymer flood would not result in an incremental oil recovery in a core flood for a light oil, but for viscous oil it recovered a significant amount of oil. The waterflood and tertiary polymer flood together recovered similar amount of oil as a secondary polymer flood. In some cases (water-wet vuggy dolomite cores) even higher recovery was observed for tertiary polymer floods. The micromodel model experiments indicated that the extra recovery during tertiary flood could be due to the counter-current imbibition of injected water. The micromodel study also helped visualize the effect of viscosity ratio and wettability on the finger size and spacing, and water oil distribution in the porous medium. New Contribution: New heterogeneous micromodels were created and used to visualize the impact of wettability and heterogeneity on viscous instability in flow through porous media. Corefloods showed that tertiary polymer flood is more effective in viscous oils than in light oils. "

                    "abstract": "Description of the material: The objective of this study is to develop strategies to improve oil recovery in highly fractured carbonate reservoirs at a high temperature. Such reservoirs have high salinity and high hardness formation brines. Nonionic surfactants (Ethoxylated amines) and anionic surfactants (Ethoxylated sulfonates) were investigated due to their compatibility with hard brine and thermal hydrolytic stability properties. Chelating agents were added with anionic surfactants to produce non-precipitating solutions and achieve robust wettability alteration. The performance of surfactant formulation with or without chelating agents was evaluated on wettability alteration based on contact angle measurement on calcites and oil recovery through spontaneous imbibition and surfactant core flood. Application: Oil recovery from fractured carbonates by waterflood is often inefficient due to a combination of poor sweep and the commonly oil-wet nature of the rocks. However, high temperatures (>80oC), high salinity, and especially high hardness, pose challenges to development of high performance surfactant formulations such as precipitation of calcium and magnesium salts. This work is identifies a strategy to develop surfactant systems which can improve oil recovery by wettability alteration at such harsh conditions. Results and Conclusions: Ethoxylated amines (nonionic surfactant at pH>7) were found to be good wettability alteration agents, which also have good thermal stability and solubility in hard brines at high temperatures. Anionic surfactants, e.g., ethoxylated sulfonates, form thermally stable surfactant formulation at higher temperatures (>80oC) in the presence of chelating agents. Three chelating agents have been tested for their compatibility with anionic surfactants. Only with chelating agents, these anionic surfactants achieved high performance in wettability alteration and improved oil recovery through spontaneous imbibition. The anionic surfactants and chelating agents could recover up to 50-60% OOIP by spontaneous imbibition at 100oC. Chelating agents promoted mineral dissolution, but by themselves they caused little spontaneous imbibition. Chelating agents softened the injection brine, reactivated anionic surfactants to alter the wettability. Significant New Contribution:Surfactants and chelating agents have been identified which can cause wettability alteration in originally oil-wet carbonates and recover oil by spontaneous imbibition at high temperature with high hardness brines.

                    "abstract": "Description of Material: The goal of this work is to evaluate stabilization of foams by a combination of nanoparticles and surfactants. Hydrophilic silica nanoparticles (NP) and anionic surfactants were used to stabilize foams. Static foams were generated with just surfactants and surfactant-NP mixtures with and without a crude oil. The decay of the foam height with time was studied and half-lives were determined. The thickness of the foam lamella was studied by fluorescence microscopy. Aqueous foams were created in porous media in-situ by co-injecting the surfactant and/or nanoparticles with nitrogen gas through a Berea sandstone core at a fixed quality. Pressure drop across the core was measured to estimate the achieved mobility reduction factor (MRF). These experiments were also conducted in the presence of residual oil. Application: Surfactant stabilized foams have been used for vertical conformance and mobility control in gas enhanced oil recovery processes. However, surfactants cannot stabilize foams for long periods of time, especially in the presence of oil, high salinity and high temperature. The robustness of surfactant can be increased significantly by addition of surface-modified nanoparticles. Results: Static foam tests revealed strong stabilizing effects of nanoparticle addition. Lighter crude oils are more destabilizing to foams than heavier oils. Foam flow experiments showed that adding nanoparticles even in low concentration (0.3 wt%) can significantly improve the foam stability and mobility reduction factor in the absence of oil. The core floods with a crude oil revealed that the incremental oil recovery by surfactant-NP blend over water flood was about 10% OOIP with an immiscible gas. Fluorescence microscopy of vertical foam films elucidates the stabilization mechanism of how nanoparticles are trapped in the Gibbs-Plateau border as well as lamellas between two bubbles which retards bubble coalescence and enhances foam stability. Significant New Contribution: This study offers a new systematic evaluation of foam performance of surfactant-nanoparticle blends in bulk and in porous media. Such foams may be able to provide mobility control in miscible and immscible gas displacements and in conformance control in harsh conditions. "

The objective of this work is to evaluate small polymeric surfactants for their viscosifying capacity in reservoir brines and oil displacement ability. The phase behavior and viscosity of a triblock copolymer (P123) are studied as a function of brine salinity and temperature. Its flow through a porous rock and oil displacement is evaluated and compared with that of a Newtonian fluid (glycerol) and a non-Newtonian fluid with a high molecular weight polymer (HPAM) of similar viscosity. P123 forms cylindrical micelles in brine to give high viscosity. The viscosity increases with salinity at a low salinity, but decreases at a higher salinity. In the secondary mode, both the polymers (P123 and HPAM) and glycerol solutions increase the oil recovery significantly over the water flood. The oil recovery is similar for the three viscous fluids. In the tertiary mode, none of the viscous fluids increased oil recovery over the waterflood at typical field rates. Pressure drop during P123 flood is significantly lower than the pressure drop during HPAM and glycerol floods of similar initial viscosity. Viscosity of the aqueous P123 solution decreases when it is equilibrated with oil. Some of the cylindrical micelles are converted to spherical micelles in the presence of solubilized oil. P123 is not as cost effective as HPAM because it is slightly more expensive and needs a higher concentration for a similar viscosity. "

If the permeability is low and the reservoir is oil-wet, the remaining oil saturation can be quite high. The goal of this work is to mobilize a part of this oil by surfactant injection. An anionic-surfactant formulation was developed to alter wettability and lower interfacial tension (IFT) for a gasflooded, carbonate reservoir. Different coreflood strategies, including gas/water/surfactant/water (GWSW), gas/surfactant/gas (GSG), gas/surfactant/water (GSW), and gas/surfactant/water/gas (GSWG) floods, were investigated. GSG, GWSW, and GSWG corefloods conducted in limestone cores recovered an additional 40–50% of the original oil in place (OOIP) because of the injection of surfactant. GSW corefloods conducted in a vuggy dolomite recovered less: an approximately 20%-of-OOIP incremental recovery. Numerical simulation was used to match GSG and GSW corefloods and estimate multiphase-flow functions. A 2D conceptual simulation model using these functions was built for an anticline reservoir for gas and surfactant-solution injection. GSG flooding using wettability-altering surfactant exhibited high oil recovery at the field scale. IFT reduction, wettability alteration, and foam formation contributed to enhanced oil recovery (EOR). "

                    "abstract": "Despite the possible detrimental effect of oil on foam displacement processes in CO2 EOR the effect of oil on dense CO2 foams has received little attention relative to air foams or low density CO2 foams. Herein, the effect of both a first contact miscible hydrocarbon (dodecane) and crude oil on CO2/water (C/W) foams generated by a switchable surfactant, C12–14N(EO)2 was examined at dense CO2 conditions at temperatures up to 120 °C (393 K) and 3400 psia (23 MPa). Upon increasing the fractional flow of dodecane, a gradual decrease in foam viscosity was observed as the foam becomes unstable. Since only two phases are present, traditional destabilization mechanisms for three phase oil/gas/water systems based on the entering and spreading are invalid. Therefore, an alternative mechanism is suggested whereby added dodecane strengthen the surfactant tail interactions with the nonaqueous phase (mixture of CO2 and dodecane) to shift the hydrophilic-CO2 philic balance (HCB) towards an unstable region. This mechanism is supported by a decrease of the CO2–water interfacial tension from ∼5 mN/m to 0.5 mN/m for dodecane–water systems at 120 °C and 3400 psia. The effect of crude oil was more profound than for dodecane, whereby rapid destabilization of foam occurred at an oil fractional flow as low as 0.2. In this case, the immiscible portion of the crude oil can enter and spread at the lamellae to destabilize the foam as is evident in positive entering and spreading coefficients. Also, other foam destabilizing parameters such as temperature and capillary pressure were studied in the presence of oil and the results were consistent with those in the absence of oil. "

The slow thinning of these viscoelastic lamellae leads to greater foam stability upon slowing down Ostwald ripening and coalescence. In the aqueous phase, the viscoelasticity may be increased by increasing the surfactant tail length to form more entangled micelles even at high temperatures and salinity. Systematic measurements of the steady state shear viscosity of aqueous solutions of the diamine surfactant (C16-18N(CH3)C3N(CH3)2) were conducted at varying surfactant concentrations and salinity to determine the parameters for formation of entangled wormlike micelles. The apparent viscosity and stability of CO2/water foams were compared for systems with viscoelastic entangled micellar aqueous phases relative to those with much less viscous spherical micelles.

                    "abstract": "Miscible CO2 flooding has been used as an EOR method for carbonate reservoirs which hold around 60% of the world's oil reserves. However, natural fractures, unfavorable mobility ratio and gravity segregation in carbonate reservoirs often lead to premature CO2 breakthrough and bypassed oil. To remedy this situation, CO2 foam has been used to reduce the mobility of the injected CO2. Typically, this employed a water soluble surfactant for foam propagation. However, surfactant transport in the aqueous phase was often hindered by surfactant adsorption and undesirable chemical reactions with reservoir minerals. In this study, we investigated whether CO2-soluble surfactants were more effective than water-soluble surfactant in oil recovery of fractured carbonate reservoirs under miscible conditions. A series of corefloods were conducted to determine the oil recovery factor (RF), speed of foam propagation and foam strength in artificially fractured carbonate cores at 35 °C (308.15 K) and 1500 psi (1.034*107 Pa) which was above minimum miscibility pressure. Silurian Dolomite outcrop with permeability of 150 md and West Texas Wasson crude were used. The cores were intermediate-wet indicated by both qualitative and quantitative tests. Three different surfactants were compared including an anionic water-soluble surfactant and other two nonionic CO2 soluble surfactants (2-ethyl-1-hexanol with different ethylene oxide groups) with distinct degree of solubility in CO2. Phase behavior experiments indicated these surfactants did not lower the interfacial tension significantly between the crude and water. RF of CO2 flooding was only 24% due to the heterogeneous nature of the fractured core. Co-injection of CO2 and water increased the RF to 35%, which was further increased to 54% when a water-soluble only surfactant presented. However, use of CO2 foam by the two CO2-soluble surfactants increased the RF to 71% and 92% respectively, with a higher RF for the surfactant that partitioned more to the CO2 phase. Also, pressure drop in different sections of the core confirmed that the surfactant which partitioned more into the CO2 phase gave a faster-propagating and stronger foam. These results educated that the partitioning of surfactant into the CO2 phase has several advantages. First, it allows surfactant to be transported in the CO2 phase ahead of the aqueous phase thus leading to faster foam propagation. Second, it generated a stronger foam. The combined effect of the two leaded to higher RF in current scenarios. Several hypotheses based on literature were raised and listed to further interpret the observations. Our results also reinforce that the so-called optimal CO2 soluble surfactant is case dependent and is the function of injection strategy, reservoir environment, and operation pressure or rates as well as other specific conditions. One could tailor a surfactant with suitable solubility in the CO2 phase to optimize oil recovery in fractured carbonates. We believed the results were encouraging enough to warrant further R&D and eventual field piloting. "

However, gas injection often associates with fingering due to high gas mobility, which leaves a large portion of the reservoir unswept. This study addresses gas mobility control observations through novel X-ray microfocus visualization of core-flood experiments and interpretation aided by numerical simulation. We use foam as our primary mobility control agent for improving conformance. The experimental setup utilizes an automated fluid injection system monitored by an X-ray microfocus scanner to quantify displacement patterns and saturations during WAG core-flood experiments. The core-flood device – placed within an X-ray shielded cabinet – is wirelessly operated through a computer. The resolution of the images permits observation of not only core scale fingering but also pore-scale displacement. We use a metastable foam with surfactant dissolved in the liquid phase to stabilize the gas diffusion in the liquid and to decrease the permeability and/or lower the apparent gas viscosity. Results show that saturation patterns and displacement front during WAG injection are highly influenced by bedding orientation and rock heterogeneity. Without gas mobility control during WAG injection, fingering and early breakthrough occur in those cases in which bedding orientation facilitates gas to flow through high permeability layers. In these cases, sweep efficiency is low during early time injection of nitrogen and only improves after injection is prolonged. With gas mobility control, the displacement efficiency is significantly improved. Also, dynamic processes like phase trapping, which could severely impair permeability and overall sweep efficiency, is more clearly visualized with the microfocus technique. Simulation work matches experimental data well and replicates saturation patterns measured experimentally in laminated Berea sandstone samples. The novel visualization technique presented here provides new pore-scale experimental insight to quantifying WAG displacement in heterogeneous media, a resolution one order of magnitude higher than with medical X-ray CT or other core-scale visualization techniques. The findings are useful for understanding flow regimes in structurally complex and heterogeneous formations. "

Conformance control of CO2 by creating foam between supercritical CO2 and brine to improve the sweep efficiency is documented in this paper. The foam was implemented in an inverted fivespot pattern in the Salt Creek field where the second Wall Creek (WC2) sandstone formation is the primary producing interval, with a net thickness of about 80 ft and at a depth of approximately 2,200 ft. The initial phase of the foam pilot design involving identifying the pilot area, performing coreflood experiments, performaing dynamic reservoir simulation for history match, and forecasting with foam have been documented in the literature. As a part of the foam pilot monitoring, a gas tracer study was performed before and after the injection of foam in the reservoir. The initial planning, monitoring, and part of foam response is covered in earlier publications. The last surfactant injection in the field was in June 2016. This paper provides the complete analysis of the results from the foam pilot. The foam pilot was successful in demonstrating the deeper conformance control and improvement in sweep efficiency, which resulted in 25,000 bbl of incremental oil. Also overall, a 22% decrease in CO2 injection amount is realized due to better utilization of CO2 compared to the baseline. "

                    "abstract": "The Vapor-Oil Gravity Drainage (VOGD) is a low temperature, solvent-enhanced gas-oil gravity drainage (GOGD) process targeting naturally fractured viscous reservoirs. The experimental set up and corresponding acquired data was previously introduced by the authors (Anand et al., 2017) in which the effects of temperature, solvent injection rate, and solvent type (n-Butane and dichloromethane (DCM)) were investigated. Results from Anand et al. work indicated encouraging high oil rates and ultimate recoveries; results also demonstrated that the oil rates and recovery were impacted by diffusion and dispersion (in the form of intrinsic gas rate), asphaltene precipitation, and capillary pressure. The intent of this work is to further study the mechanisms behind VOGD; in particular those related to operating pressure and solvent vapor-oil capillary pressure. The results from this work show that the ultimate recovery and oil rate are positively correlated to the operating pressure; experiments conducted at 50% and 75% saturation pressure (Psat) yielded lower ultimate oil recoveries, ranging from 33% to 68% of original oil in place (OOIP), when compared to the experiments conducted at 90% Psat (70% of OOIP). Moreover, n-butane performed better than DCM and lesser asphaltene precipitation was seen at lower Psat. The main drivers for these observations were found to be lower solvent solubility and larger capillary pressure values at lower values of Psat. "

                    "abstract": "Aqueous foam has been demonstrated through laboratory and field experiments to be a promising conformance control technique. This study explores the foaming behavior of a CO2-soluble, cationic, amine-based surfactant. A distinguishing feature of this surfactant is its ability to dissolve in supercritical CO2 and to form Wormlike Micelles (WLM) at elevated salinity. Presence of WLM led to an increase in viscosity of the aqueous surfactant solution. Our study investigates how the presence of WLM structures affect transient foam behavior in a homogenous porous media (sand pack). Sand pack foam flooding experiments were performed with two aqueous phase salinities: low salinity (15 wt. % NaCl) associated with spherical-shaped micelle and high salinity (20 wt. % NaCl) associated with WLM. We compared the onset of strong foam propagation and foam apparent viscosity buildup rate between the two salinity cases. The effect of WLM presence in transient foam behavior was investigated for co-injection and water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection strategies. In all foam flooding experiments, the surfactant was delivered in the CO2 phase. Strong foam was generated in all foam flooding experiments, with an apparent foam viscosity of at least 600 cp for co-injection and 200 cp for WAG floods after five total injected pore volumes. The observed strong foam indicated that the delivery of surfactant in the CO2 phase was successful and that the surfactant molecules partition to the water phase in the sand pack. In comparison to the low salinity cases, the high salinity foam floods associated with the presence of WLM led to better foam performance. We observed an earlier onset of strong foam propagation as well as a higher apparent viscosity buildup rate. Better foam performance at higher salinity may be attributed in large part to the presence of WLM structures in the foam liquid phase. Entanglement of these WLM structures may have led to in-situ viscosification of the foam liquid phase and an increase in disjoining pressure between foam films. Both phenomena may have reduced the rate of foam film coalescence. WLM structures behave similarly to polymer molecules. Our study may offer evidence that WLM is a valid alternative to polymer as an additive to enhance foam conformance control performance. Some potential advantages of WLM over polymer include: Delivery of surfactant in the gas phase (to alleviate the injectivity issue typically associated with high viscosity polymer-surfactant solution), resistance to extreme temperature and salinity, and reversible shear degradation.

                    "abstract": "Application of thermal and solvent EOR technologies for heavy oil recovery in naturally fractured reservoirs is generally challenging due to low permeability, unfavorable wettability and mobility, and considerable heat losses. Vapor-Oil Gravity Drainage (VOGD) is a modified low temperature, solventonly injection technology, targeted at improving heavy oil recovery in fractured reservoirs. It utilizes high fluid conductivity in vertical fractures to establish large solvent-oil contact area rapidly and eliminates the need for massive energy and water inputs as compared to thermal processes, by operating at significantly lower temperatures with no water requirement. Investigation of the effect of solvent injection rate, temperature and solvent-type (n-Butane and dichloromethane (DCM)) on the recovery profile was carried out on a single-fracture core model. This work combines the knowledge obtained from experimental investigation and analytical modeling using Butler's correlation with validated fluid property models to understand the relative importance of various recovery mechanisms behind VOGD, namely molecular diffusion, asphaltene precipitation and deposition, capillarity, and viscosity reduction. Experimental and analytical model studies indicated that molecular diffusion, convective dispersion, viscosity reduction via solvent dissolution and gravity drainage are dominant phenomena in the recovery process. Material balance analysis indicated limited asphaltene precipitation. High fluid transmissibility in the fracture along with gravity drainage led to early solvent breakthroughs and oil recoveries as high as 75% OOIP. Injecting butane at higher rate and operating temperature enhanced vapor solvent rate inside the core leading to highest ultimate recovery. Increasing operating temperature alone did not improve ultimate recovery due to decreased solvent solubility in the oil. Although with DCM, lower asphaltene precipitation should maximize oil recovery rate, its higher solvent (vapor)-oil interfacial tension resulted in lower ultimate recovery than butane. Ideal density and non-ideal double-log viscosity mixing rules along with molecular diffusivity as a power function of oil viscosity were used to obtain an accurate physical description of the fluids for modeling solvent-oil behavior. With critical phenomena such as capillarity and asphaltene precipitation missing, Butler's analytical model under predicts recovery rates by as much as 70%. "

                    "abstract": "It has been experimentally observed that Low-Tension-Gas (LTG) flooding can be a suitable enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method for low-permeability carbonate reservoirs with high salinity and hard formation brine. LTG flooding improves oil recovery by combining two effects: a reduction of the interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water and mobility control through the formation of in-situ foam with an injected gas. However, the high cost of chemicals and/or the limited supply of gas can make this process economically challenging. In order to optimize the LTG process, an injection strategy has been designed such that the oil recovery can be maximized, using a minimum amount of the injected gas and the surfactant, thereby ensuring a more economically-viable recovery process. A low-permeable (<10 md) Middle Eastern limestone reservoir with a high formation brine salinity (~200,000 ppm and hardness 19,000 ppm) is the target reservoir of this study. Surfactant injection strategy was optimized by varying the concentration and pore volumes of the surfactant slug injected. Nitrogen gas was co-injected during select time periods throughout the entire chemical injection in order to identify the significance of mobility control during the crucial phases of the LTG flooding. The coreflood results emphasized the significance of the injection of gas, even at lower foam quality, for the maintenance of mobility control. Ultimate oil recovery of over 60% (residual oil post waterflood) was achieved, even after reducing the surfactant concentration by 75% and inducing a different in-situ salinity profile as compared to earlier studies. An innovative method for measuring surfactant adsorption using Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) was developed, which could provide individual dynamic adsorption data for each of the three classes of surfactants used.

                    "abstract": "Steam override and channeling due to high steam mobility during steam injection for heavy oil recovery can result in high operating costs and low oil recovery. The high steam mobility issue can be overcome with a sufficient increase in the apparent steam viscosity by surfactant stabilized foams. The objective of this research is to identify surfactants that are thermally stable and can generate stable foam at typical conditions of steam injection for thermal steam EOR processes. Proprietary surfactant structures were found to be stable at up to 250 °C for at least 2 weeks. It was also found that these surfactants at 0.5 wt% concentration were able to generate stable foam in the sandpack with steam at 75% quality (i.e. volume fraction of steam in the injected mixture of steam and surfactant solution) and up to 250 °C. Foam increased the apparent steam viscosity by three orders of magnitude without bitumen and by two orders of magnitude in the presence of bitumen. The results demonstrate that this type of surfactant significantly reduces steam mobility, which is needed to overcome steam gravity override and channeling issues. The study of structure-property relationship shows that the foaming efficiency and effectiveness depend on the temperature and the hydrophobicity of the surfactants. Past research reported in literature focused mostly on sulfonate surfactants as foaming agents for steam EOR processes at operating temperatures up to 200 °C and in the absence of oil. This work has extended the scope of steam foam research as it identified surfactants that are thermally stable and could stabilize foam at up to 250 °C even in the presence of oil. In addition, the structures of the identified surfactants in this study could be optimized with respect to surfactant hydrophobicity to tailor the transport and thermodynamic properties as well as the foam property of the surfactants to target specific reservoir temperature and salinity condition.

A computed-tomography (CT) scanner is used to obtain the saturation profile within the core throughout the experiment, while the overall hydrocarbon productivity is measured from the overall pressure drop across the core. On the basis of the saturation and pressure measurements, we interpret the potential physical mechanism regarding the productivity reduction from water block and its self-mitigation facilitated by the capillary imbibition.

                    "abstract": "The repeatability of steady-state foam experiments in porous media had been a major concern due to either alterations in core petrophysical properties or the impact of trapped gas. Trapped gas is an important cause of history-dependent foam behavior known as foam hysteresis. The removal of trapped gas generated in a previous foam experiment can sometimes be difficult when one tries to restore the core for a subsequent experiment. This paper presents systematic studies of steady-state foam behavior without hysteresis and foam transport with hysteresis. We developed a procedure to restore a sand-pack system after a foam flood, which ensured that every foam experiment started with the same condition of the sand pack saturated with 100% surfactant solution and ruled out the impact of surfactant adsorption or gas trapping. An experimental design composed of 24 steady-state foam core floods were carried out and the local pressure drops were measured and correlated with varying phase (gas and water) velocity and foam quality. Next, two groups of foam hysteresis experiments were conducted by varying either the foam quality or the total fluid velocity. The results showed that the repeatability of the experimental data was excellent in the hysteresis-free experiments. In addition to the steady-state data obtained in traditional high- and low-quality flow regimes, we have also identified a transition to highly viscous foam where the pressure gradient increased significantly from the entrance to the exit of the sand pack at steady state. This transition has only been observed with relatively low foam qualities and high liquid velocities. Multiple pore volumes of injection before foam reached a steady state in most of the experiments were observed. Various possible reasons, such as the requirement of minimum pressure gradient and the homogeneity of the system, are discussed. In the subsequent study of foam hysteresis, the first group of experiments showed that the final steady states of foam apparent viscosity at fixed foam quality and total fluid rate were generally repeatable regardless of initial state (phase saturations) of the sand pack in the high-quality regime; however, the initial state had a significant impact on the transient process before reaching a steady state. In the second group of experiments, the results indicated that foam hysteresis had a significant influence on the final foam steady state. To our knowledge, it is the first time that such reliable and systematic data base for steady-state foam behavior in porous media without hysteresis was provided. This comprehensive data set in combination with foam-hysteresis data could therefore be used for foam-model evaluation and improvement with high confidence. "

However, a significant fraction of the fracturing fluid is never recovered, and thus may reduce the hydrocarbon permeability near the fracture. Here, we experimentally mimic the water-invasion process during fracturing, and measure the effective permeability changes in a low-permeability core. Measurements of water flowback and effective permeability as a function of interfacial tension (IFT), flow rate, and shut-in time suggest that water is being held at the fracture face because of the capillary discontinuity (i.e., when the water leaves the matrix and enters a space with minimal capillary pressure). This effect arises from the capillary interaction between the matrix and the fracture, and is akin to the capillary end effect in coreflood experiments. The results show that this effect, although only a laboratory experimental artifact for conventional reservoirs, can be a significant source of effective hydrocarbon-permeability reduction by fracturing-fluid invasion into the formation in unconventional and tight reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "Nanotechnology is the design and application of engineered or naturally occurring nanoparticles with at least one dimension of the order of 1–100 nm to accomplish specific purposes. Nanoparticles possess three unique properties. First, their small size enables nanoparticles to be transported into formation pores not accessible to larger particles. Second, at nanoscale, material properties are size dependent. Therefore nanoparticles can be engineered to contain specific optical, magnetic, interfacial, electrical or chemical properties to perform specific functions. Third, they have a very large surface-to-area ratio. Combined together, these unique properties allow nanoparticles to be used for many purposes in the oilfield. The objective of this paper is to conduct a critical review of the recent literature to determine the status of research and development and field application of nanotechnology to the oilfield. Most of the proposed applications of nanotechnology in the oilfield can be classified into the following six areas: (1) sensing or imaging, (2) enhanced oil recovery (EOR), (3) gas mobility control, (4) drilling and completion, (5) produced fluid treatment, and (6) tight reservoir application. Our review shows that much of the current research is focused on the performance of nanoparticles in the reservoir. Some work is done of the propagation of nanoparticles and very little work is done on the delivery and recovery of nanoparticles. In addition, a lack of well-defined health, safety and environmental protocols for safe delivery and recovery of nanoparticles can be a showstopper and more focused research is needed in this area. Our work also shows that affordability of nanoparticles is another showstopper due to the large quantity needed for oilfield applications and the current lack of vendors. As a remedy, we propose focused research and development on the use of naturally-occurring and industrial waste nanoparticles for oilfield applications. Of the six application areas, we rank imaging, drilling through unstable zones, tight reservoir applications and EOR as ones having the biggest potential impact. Using nanoparticles to detect hydrocarbon saturation in a reservoir can significantly impact how we plan field development, such as well placement. Similarly, using nano-enhanced drilling fluid to stabilize and drill through unstable zones can increase rate of penetration, reduce drilling cost and minimize environmental impact. Furthermore, using specially-designed nanoparticles to image and prop up induced and naturally occurring fractures in tight reservoirs can lead to sweet spot identification and more prolific wells. With its ability to make reservoir rocks more water-wet, waterflooding by nanofluids also has the potential to augment or replace low-salinity waterflooding as an EOR method. "

The major mechanism for increased oil recovery is a wettability change from oil-wet to water-wet, which is induced by ion exchange between the injected fluid and the clay surface. This paper presents a framework for field scale modeling, assisted history match, and robust optimization of LSW under geological uncertainties that has rarely been discussed in the past. To handle this complex recovery process, a comprehensive ion-exchange model has been implemented, fully coupled with geochemistry specially designed for the modeling of LSW physical phenomena in an EOS reservoir simulator. This model is capable of accounting for the critical role of the properties, quantity, and distributions of clay minerals. A systematic study was performed to evaluate the critical effects of geology on large scale LSW performance. Numerous geostatistical realizations of a five-spot LSW pattern were generated to evaluate the effect of clay on LSW. The numerical simulation results indicate that LSW's performance depends critically on the reservoir geological characteristics. Based on the integrated modeling approach presented in this paper, multiple geological realizations can be automatically generated from a big-loop approach that is needed for fast and accurate HM and optimization of LSW. The key parameters for successful field scale LSW HM include: clay distribution/quantity associated with different facies, relative permeability modification, wettability alteration thresholds, reservoir minerals, geochemical reactions, and operating conditions. More importantly, LSW HM by tuning reservoir parameters may only lead to poor prediction results, while the integrated modeling approach provides much better forecasting results to true history data. Finally, a new concept for LSW robust optimization under geological uncertainty is introduced and demonstrated with reservoir simulation. As there are uncertainties associated with the geological modeling of the clay distribution, this paper shows how robust optimization can be applied to reduce uncertainties in the LSW optimization through well placement.

A coreflood workflow was designed in this work to explore the mechanisms behind the formation and mitigation of water blocking in rock matrix. Since shale is typically considered as mixed-wet, one core sample was altered from natively water-wet into oil-wet and tested through an identical experimental procedure; this provided a direct comparison of water blocking in water-wet and oil-wet states. Recently, surfactants have been widely proposed to enhance the oil production from shales, through either wettability alteration or interfacial tension (i.e., IFT) reduction. A microemulsion-forming surfactant was then tested in the core sample at the oil-wet state, also through the identical experimental procedure; this provided another direct comparison on rock permeability enhancement from either one of these two techniques on the same porous media. Our results showed the increase of rock permeability to hydrocarbon is a naturally-triggered process under the water-wet condition, where higher pressure-drawdown delays the increase; however, it is a pressure-drawdown-driven process under the oil-wet condition, where higher pressure-drawdown promotes the permeability increase. Moreover, when oil-wet rock is altered into water-wet, the late-time rock permeability is enhanced but the amount of flowback water is significantly reduced. However, permeability reduction due to matrix-fracture interaction may take place at the early time, the degree of which depends on the level of IFT reduction. For low-permeability rocks that the steady state requires long time to achieve, it might be a better option to use surfactants that give ultralow IFT reductions. "

However, the capability of reservoir simulators to model accurately this process is very limited. This paper provides a critical review of the state of the art in research and field applications of LSW. The focus is on a widely agreed mechanism that is the wettability alteration from preferential oil wetness to water wetness of formation rock surfaces. Ion exchange and geochemical reactions have been experimentally found to be important in oil mobilization due to enhanced water spreading at low salinity. To evaluate the significance of this surface wetting mechanism, a comprehensive ion exchange model with geochemical processes has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. This new model captures most of the important physical and chemical phenomena that occur in LSW, including intra-aqueous reactions, mineral dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange and wettability alteration. The proposed LSW model is tested using the low-salinity core-flood experiments reported by Fjelde et al. (2012) for a North Sea reservoir and the low-salinity and high-salinity heterogeneous core-flood experiments by Rivet (2009) for a Texas reservoir. Excellent agreements between the model and the experiments in terms of effluent ion concentrations, effluent pH, and oil recovery were achieved. In addition, the model was also proved to be highly comparable with the ion-exchange model of the geochemistry software PHREEQC for both low salinity and high salinity (Appelo, 1994). Important observations in laboratory and field tests such as a local pH increase, a decrease in divalent effluent concentration, mineralogy contributions, and the influence of connate water and injected brine compositions can be reproduced with the proposed LSW model. Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for LSW design and the interpretation of process performance in field tests. Although the advantages of LSW have been reported, none of the systematic approaches has addressed the issues of modeling and predicting LSW field-scale performance. The new modeling approach introduced in this research can effectively capture the critical effects of geology in the LSW process. This integrated modeling approach involves the use of geological software, a reservoir simulator, and a robust optimizer in a closed loop for sensitivity analysis, history matching, optimization, and uncertainty assessment. The field-scale benefits of secondary and tertiary LSW are then addressed. "

                    "title": "Evaluation of CO2 Low Salinity Water-Alternating-Gas for enhanced oil recovery",
                    "abstract": "Low Salinity Waterflooding (LSW) is an emerging attractive enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method because of its oil recovery performance and relatively simple, environmentally friendly implementation, when compared with conventional high salinity waterflooding and EOR approaches. More importantly, another advantage of LSW is that it can be integrated with other EOR methods (in hybrid LSW processes), i.e. chemical or miscible gas flooding. The merits of combining LSW with CO2 injection is investigated in this paper, and a novel EOR method, Low Salinity Water Alternating CO2 (CO2 LSWAG), is proposed. CO2 LSWAG injection promotes the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these methods which further enhances oil recovery and overcomes the late production problems frequently encountered in conventional WAG. CO2 LSWAG has been evaluated in both one-dimensional and full-field scale with positive results compared with conventional high salinity WAG. To investigate the advantages of CO2 LSWAG, a comprehensive ion exchange model associated with geochemical processes has been implemented and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. 1D simulation of different CO2 LSWAG schemes are first conducted to understand the combined effects of solubility of CO2 in brine, dissolution of carbonate minerals, ion exchange, and wettability alteration. CO2 LSWAG performance is then evaluated on a field scale through an integrated workflow that includes geological modeling, multi-phase multi component reservoir flow modeling and process optimization. The simulation results indicate that CO2 LSWAG has the highest oil recovery compared to conventional high salinity waterflood, high salinity WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and low salinity waterflood. A number of geological realizations are generated to assess the geological uncertainty effect, in particular clay distribution uncertainties, on CO2 LSWAG efficiency. CO2 LSWAG injection strategies are optimized by identifying key WAG parameters. Finally, CO2 LSWAG is evaluated in the full field scale for a North Sea reservoir and the simulation results shows that CO2 LSWAG yields about 4.5% incremental OOIP compared to the conventional high salinity WAG. The proposed workflow demonstrates the synergy between CO2 WAG and LSW. Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for screening, design, optimization, and uncertainty assessment of the process. CO2 LSWAG is a promising EOR technique as it not only combines the benefits of CO2 injection and low salinity water floods but also promotes the synergy between these processes through the interactions between geochemical reactions associated with CO2 injection, ion exchange process, and wettability alteration. This paper demonstrates the merits of this process through modeling, optimization and uncertainty assessment. "

It focuses on oil/water miscible methods – titled ‘Low-Tension-Gas (LTG)’ in this manuscript – for mobilizing and displacing the remaining crude oil after waterflood. This manuscript builds on previous work establishing Low-Tension-Gas (LTG) as an effective method for (oil to gas) sub-miscible tertiary recovery in tight sandstone and carbonate reservoirs (Szlendak et al., 2013). Such work determined that a high tertiary recovery of 75–90% could be demonstrated with many of the same process attributes of Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flooding but without many of the limitations associated with polymer application in tight formations. To better understand actual displacement phenomenon, where gas fractional flow can substantially vary, this paper presents two sets of data that empirically express LTG behavior. The first dataset was performed at differing (but constant) gas fractional flow (co-injection). Results show substantially higher oil recovery for floods with higher gas fractional flow (50% and 85%) during co-injection. The second dataset was performed at (cycle dependent) changing gas fractional flow (SAG). Comparison to co-injection results indicates that surfactant-alternating-gas (SAG) injection demonstrated improved displacement and overall recovery versus co-injection at the same overall average gas fractional flow (50%). Finally, a mechanism for the displacement of in-situ fluids in tight formations during LTG injection is presented. It is based upon: the strong correlation between flood evolution and recovery attributes; and the high and consistent mobility reduction observed during extended liquid cycling in SAG injection. "

This work shows IGA's potential as a useful tool for next generation reservoir simulation, highlighting its ability to exactly capture complex-shaped geometrical features in the reservoir and, consequentially, accurately model the pressure fields. First, an IGA code is validated against the analytic solution for a quarter five-spot pattern as well as a reference solution for a straight line source problem with pressure enforced at the corners of the domain. Next, the numerical efficiency of IGA is compared against a finite element method solution of single phase flow in a 2D representative reservoir containing a centralized \"S-shaped\" line source. Results suggest a clear advantage of the IGA method over the classical finite element method, which has lower convergence rates in terms of number of degrees of freedom. "

                    "abstract": "The interfacial properties for surfactants at the supercritical CO2–water (C–W) interface at temperatures above 80 °C have very rarely been reported given limitations in surfactant solubility and chemical stability. These limitations, along with the weak solvent strength of CO2, make it challenging to design surfactants that adsorb at the C–W interface, despite the interest in CO2-in-water (C/W) foams (also referred to as macroemulsions). Herein, we examine the thermodynamic, interfacial and rheological properties of the surfactant C12–14N(EO)2 in systems containing brine and/or supercritical CO2 at elevated temperatures and pressures. Because the surfactant is switchable from the nonionic state to the protonated cationic state as the pH is lowered over a wide range in temperature, it is readily soluble in brine in the cationic state below pH 5.5, even up to 120 °C, and also in supercritical CO2 in the nonionic state. As a consequence of the affinity for both phases, the surfactant adsorption at the CO2–water interface was high, with an area of 207 Å2/molecule. Remarkably, the surfactant lowered the interfacial tension (IFT) down to ∼5 mN/m at 120 °C and 3400 psia (23 MPa), despite the low CO2 density of 0.48 g/ml, indicating sufficient solvation of the surfactant tails. The phase behavior and interfacial properties of the surfactant in the cationic form were favorable for the formation and stabilization of bulk C/W foam at high temperature and high salinity. Additionally, in a 1.2 Darcy glass bead pack at 120 °C, a very high foam apparent viscosity of 146 cP was observed at low interstitial velocities given the low degree of shear thinning. For a calcium carbonate pack, C/W foam was formed upon addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the feed brine to keep the pH below 4, by the common ion effect, in order to sufficiently protonate the surfactant. The ability to form C/W foams at high temperatures is of interest for a variety of applications in chemical synthesis, separations, materials science, and subsurface energy production. "

                    "abstract": "Low Tension Gas (LTG) flooding is a novel EOR process which can address challenging reservoir conditions such as high salinity, high temperature, and tight rock. Current process understanding is limited, and a joint experimental and modeling approach allows for both interpretation and insight into the complex interactions between the key process parameters of salinity gradient, foam strength, microemulsion phase behavior, and phase desaturation in order to achieve a physically correct and predictive process model. We performed a series of corefloods in high permeability Berea sandstones (~500 mD) to demonstrate the impact of salinity gradient on the LTG process and interactions between key mechanisms such as microemulsion phase behavior and foam stability. In order to provide additional insight into the experimental study and improve understanding of the LTG process, we used our newly developed LTG simulator which we built within CMG GEM. The results demonstrate that decreasing slug injection salinity can lead to a 15% increase in residual oil in place (ROIP) recovery over a slug injected at optimum salinity, with earlier breakthrough and steeper recovery slope. In addition, there is evidence of a late time pressure buildup as salinity is decreased through mixing with drive salinity which is indicative of increasing foam stability. This may be due to an inverse relationship between oil-water IFT and foam stability and thus designing an optimal salinity gradient for an LTG process requires balancing oil mobilization due to ultralow IFT and effectively displacing mobilized oil with adequate foam mobility control. We introduce and show the strength our compositional LTG simulator in a pioneering laboratory and simulation study that sheds light on the interaction between salinity, microemulsion phase behavior, and foam strength. Our conclusions indicate a significant departure from traditional ASP understanding and methodology when designing an LTG salinity gradient and serve as a foundation for future investigation. "

                    "abstract": "A systematic approach to characterize the mixed wet configurations of various reservoir rocks (sandstone and carbonates) by evaluating their surface energy distributions has been presented in this paper. This approach was tested against the macroscopic spatial distribution of oil-wet and water-wet sites and at different temperatures for validation. The new approach used to characterize the mixed wettability of a reservoir rock pertains to establishing a relation between the volume fraction of the mixed-wet reservoir rocks and surface energy of the mixture. This approach is based on an accurate description of the various physico-chemical interfacial forces present at the reservoir rock surface using Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC). Mixed-wet configurations of various reservoir rocks are created by combining water-wet and oil-wet samples of the rock in different volume fractions and shaken together to establish uniform distribution. These samples are then subjected to the IGC analysis at different temperatures to deduce their surface energy distribution. The relation developed herein is tested against spatial heterogeneity by combining the oil-wet and water-wet rock samples in a layered fashion to validate the approach. The complete method to deduce the surface energy distribution of a rock surface using IGC has also been explained in detail. A definite and conclusive relationship between the surface energy and mixed wettability of silica glass beads, calcite, and dolomite samples was established in this study. The mixed-wet configurations of the rock samples ranged from 0% oil-wet (meaning water-wet samples) to 100% oil-wet samples. The findings indicated that the Lifshitz-van der Waals component of the rock mixture did not undergo any change with change in the wetting state of the system under study. However the acid base components showed a marked decrease with increasing oil wetness before plateauing. Temperature was found to have a profound impact on the surface energy of a rock surface. Spatial heterogeneity by way of layered and segregated distribution of oil-wet and water-wet sites did not affect the eventual surface energy distribution thereby validating the new approach. "

In this paper we present a thorough analysis of the pilot performance data that has been collected to date from the field. A monitoring plan was developed to analyze the performance of the pilot area wells before and after the start of the foam pilot. The injection well tubing head pressure was controlled to maintain a constant bottom hole pressure and the fluid injection rates were monitored to capture the effect of foam generation on injectivity. Inter-well tracer studies were performed to analyze the change in CO2 flow patterns in the reservoir. Production response was monitored by performing frequent well tests. The CO2 injection rate profile monitored over several WAG cycles during the course of the implementation clearly indicates the formation and propagation of foam deep into the reservoir. CO2 soluble tracer studies performed before and after the start of the foam pilot indicate significant areal diversion of CO2. The production characteristics of the four producing wells in the pilot area indicate significant mobilization of reservoir fluids attributable to CO2 diversion in the pattern. The produced gas-liquid ratio has decreased in all four of the producing wells in the pattern. Analysis of the oil production rates shows a favorable slope change with respect to pore volumes of CO2 injected. Segregation of CO2 and water close to the injection well seems to be the primary factor adversely affecting CO2 sweep efficiency in the pilot area. Foam generation leads to a gradual expansion of the gas override zone. The gradual expansion of the gas override zone seems to be the principal mechanism behind the production responses observed from the pilot area wells. "

Different levels of IFT reductions are tested and compared in order to explore the best condition that maximizes the permeability enhancement. The effect of in-situ microemulsion generation to mobilize the trapped water is also studied.

Conventional Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flooding has limited application in low permeability (2-20 mD) and high salinity formations (~200,000 ppm TDS) with a large concentration of divalent cations. Also injectivity into such low permeability reservoirs can be a significant problem with polymer solutions. The process of low tension gas (LTG) in tight carbonates has exhibited good microscopic displacement and mobility control. It combines interfacial tension (IFT) reduction with improved mobility control by in-situ generation of foam in low-permeable heterogeneous formations. This process has been tested in the lab for a Middle Eastern carbonate reservoir, which is the subject of this paper. This strategy has been tested through either co-injection or alternating injection of slug/drive surfactant solution and gas (CO2, N2, or hydrocarbon) at low foam quality (high water content). A successful surfactant screening was performed to select the optimum surfactant formula that exhibits ultra-low IFT, good aqueous stability, and low microemulsion viscosity. The formulation allows tailoring of optimal salinity for ultra-low oil-water IFT to the variation of formation and produced water salinity. Core flood experiments have been performed, which demonstrated favorable mobilization and displacement of residual oil. Tertiary recoveries of up to 85% on remaining oil were achieved for cores with permeability less than 10 mD.

The LTG process involves the use of surfactant and gas to achieve the mobility control required to displace the micro-emulsions and the crude oil. The optimal formulation of surfactants is identified to obtain good oil/water microemulsion phase behavior and desirable high optimum salinity. The latter feature allows the LTG process to work with a wide variation of injection brine salinity or in-situ salinity gradient. The optimal injection strategies are then determined through a series of oil recovery core floods with co-injection of gas and the surfactant solution. Tertiary recovery of up to 90% of the residual OIP was achieved for cores with 150–400md air permeability. The high optimum salinity that is closest to the formation brine salinity was found to give the highest incremental oil recoveries. Macroscopic stability of displacement fronts was studied via pressure derived mobility ratios. Approximate parity of relative mobility of injected fluids was observed with respect to relative mobility of displaced water at true residual oil saturation and interpreted relative mobility of a formed oil bank. These results indicate that in-situ foam propagation was present which enabled mobility control, and that stable displacement of in-situ fluids was achieved during flooding. By replacing polymer with foam, chemical EOR methods can be expanded into formations where the use of polymer is impractical. "

The mechanism for increased oil recovery is a wettability change from oil-wet to water-wet, which is induced by ion exchange between the injected fluid and the clay surface. This paper presents the geochemistry that is required to model LSW and a method for shifting the relative permeabilities from oil-wet conditions to water-wet conditions. Excellent matches of core displacement data were achieved with a compositional simulator that incorporates those processes. As ion exchange with the clay surface is important for the success of LSW, a method for modeling clay distribution and content based on facies is proposed. A new concept for LSW optimization based on well placement is introduced and demonstrated with reservoir simulation. As there are uncertainties associated with the geological modeling of the clay distribution, this paper shows how robust optimization can be applied to reduce uncertainties in the LSW optimization through well placement.

Although the CO2 flood has been very successful at Salt Creek, it is recognized that certain isolated patterns have exhibited high CO2 production and inefficient CO2 utilization, most likely due to the channeling of fluids through high permeability, low volume zones (fractures, thief zones, etc.) and the gravity over-ride of the injected fluids.  Accordingly, a foam pilot was initiated to test the ability of CO2 to remediate these conditions. A change in the injection well rate (at constant surface injection pressure) was the first indicator to be observed; the injection rate decreased by approximately 40%, indicating a strong mobility reduction of the CO2 in the reservoir.  Production and injection profile logs were run before and after surfactant injection, and a change in profile was observed in one producer.  Chemical tracers were injected in both the gas and water phases before and after surfactant injection; results indicate that CO2 was diverted from high permeability, low volume conduits, such as fractures.  An analysis of the production data for the four offset producers show a definite increase in liquid production and a corresponding decrease in GLR (gas-liquid-ratio.)  Streamline analysis suggest areal diversion of CO2 over time.  Finally, reservoir simulation prediction cases are given and discussed. CO2 flooding has become a standard EOR technique for many water-flooded fields.  Methods for increasing the efficiency of these floods, such as the use of CO2 foam, can add great value. Introduction The Salt Creek Field in Natrona County, WY, has undergone CO2 injection since 2004.  The field has been developed in phases along the flank of the reservoir, where the minimum miscibility pressure is less than the parting pressure of the formation.  To date, over 25 MMSTB of oil have been recovered in this tertiary process.  Daily CO2 injection is approximately 675 MMcf/D at an average WAG (water-alternating-gas) ratio of 1:3, and the current oil production rate is approximately 13,500 STB/D.  Although the flood been very successful, it is recognized that certain isolated patterns have exhibited high CO2 production and inefficient CO2 utilization, most likely due to the channeling of fluids through high permeability, low volume zones (fractures, thief zones, etc.) and the gravity over-ride of the injected fluid.  A CO2 foam pilot was undertaken to see if these conditions could be remediated.

                    "abstract": "In this study, the mechanism and kinetics of asphaltene deposition in stainless steel tubes have been studied experimentally using n-heptane as the precipitant. The effects of oil velocity, temperature, and oil–precipitant volumetric dilution ratio on the rate of asphaltene deposition are investigated. Since the adhesion of asphaltenes on to the metal surface is controlled by its transport through the laminar sub layer, our focus was limited to studying the phenomena in laminar flow regime. The concentration of asphaltenes was measured using UV–visible spectrophotometer at 650 nm wavelength. This enabled us to accurately measure the amount and extent of asphaltene deposits in the stainless steel tube. It is observed that the deposition process is often accompanied by significant erosion due to the subsequent dominance of shear forces on the asphaltene deposits. However, the erosion is not complete and a certain layer of asphaltene deposits remain before the deposition process becomes dominant. The initial rate of asphaltene deposition increases with the increase in oil velocity and temperature. The deposition rates increase with the decrease in the oil–precipitant volumetric dilution ratio. The asphaltene deposits were also subjected to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize the surface composition of atoms responsible for the interfacial interaction forces due to the surface functional groups. The fundamental interaction forces between asphaltenes and a stainless steel surface was measured by using inverse gas chromatography. The surface energy of stainless steel indicated the amphoteric nature of the surface, with a slightly higher basic component. The surface energy of asphaltenes displayed a very high component of Lifshitz–van der Waals forces. However the polar component of surface energy of asphaltenes could not be measured due to its very strong interaction with the polar probes on account of its polarity. "

In this method, surfactant from a known amount of CO2 solution was transferred into an aqueous solution and the surfactant concentration of the aqueous solution was measured directly by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography). In this work, the partitioning of a series of 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) alkoxylate surfactants among an aqueous phase (water or brine) and scCO2 as a function of electrolyte concentration, temperature, and pressure was also investigated. Surfactant partition coefficient was determined based on the reduction of HPLC measured surfactant concentration in the aqueous phase due to surfactant partitioning into CO2. An understanding of surfactant partitioning between brine and scCO2 is particularly important in the design of CO2 foam processes, particularly for surfactant stabilized foam in subsurface systems, where it can affect surfactant transport and foam propagation. In general, the solubility in scCO2 increased with pressure and decreased with temperature. The partitioning of the surfactants between CO2 and water phases was almost proportional to pressure, and decreased as temperature increased, where the latter held more sensitivity. The partition coefficient was very sensitive to surfactant formula. For the 2-EH-PO5-EOx series, the partition coefficient between scCO2 and the aqueous phase increased with decreasing EO content. "

                    "abstract": "Description of the material. Stable CO2/water (C/W) foams at high temperatures and salinities have been achieved with substituted amines in limestone, sandstone and glass bead packs with permeabilities from 1 to 78 Darcy. Foams were formed upon injection of the CO2 soluble surfactant in the CO2 phase and would be beneficial for improving sweep efficiency in EOR process. Application. Despite significant interest in CO2 foams for EOR, very few studies have reported stable foams at high temperatures (120 °C) and high salinities, which are often encountered in the Middle East and elsewhere. The foams provide mobility control and stabilize the displacement front in CO2 flooded zones to improve sweep efficiency. Results, Observations, Conclusions. The amine surfactants are switchable between the nonionic and cationic states with pH or the nature of the solvent. They exhibit nonionic behavior when introduced in the CO2 phase, which favors injectivity, and cationic in the presence of concentrated brine with dissolved CO2. The hydrophilic/lipophilic balance of the amines was tuned by modification of the amine head group or tail length to design strong foams. It was important to increase the basicity of surfactants to enhance the solvation in the aqueous phase over a pH range of 4 to 7. These surfactants were effective in lowering the interfacial tension between water and CO2 at high temperature and salinity. They generated viscous C/W foams in limestone, sandstone and glass bead packs at 120 °C in the presence of 22% TDS brine when surfactants were injected from either the aqueous or CO2 phase. At pH below 6, these surfactants exhibited low oil/water partition coefficients on the order of 0.1 which suggests that these surfactants will have minimal retardation due to partitioning into oil in the EOR process. Significance of Subject Matter. These surfactants stabilized C/W foam at high temperature and salinity, and partitioned to the water phase over dodecane phase for efficient surfactant utilization. The high solubility in CO2 is beneficial for the surfactant to be available along CO2 flow pathways in a reservoir to minimize viscous fingering and gravity override. "

                    "abstract": "Description This paper proposes a novel concept of low salinity water-alternating-CO2 (CO2 LSWAG) injection under CO2 miscible displacement conditions. While LSW is an emerging EOR method based on modification of wettability and intrinsic permeability, WAG is a proven method for improving gas flooding performance by controlling the gas mobility. Therefore LSWAG injection promotes the synergy of the mechanisms underlying these methods (i.e. ion-exchange, wettability alteration, and CO2 dispersion) that further enhances oil recovery and overcomes the late production problem frequently encountered in the conventional WAG. These features are demonstrated in this work based on a field case study. Results To investigate the advantages of CO2 LSWAG, a comprehensive ion exchange model associated with geochemical processes has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. Laboratory core flood simulations of different CO2 LSWAG schemes are conducted to understand the solubility of CO2 in brine, dissolution of carbonate minerals, ion exchange, and wettability alteration. CO2 LSWAG performance is then evaluated on a field scale through an innovative workflow from geological modeling, multi-phase multi component flow modeling to process optimization. The simulation results indicate that CO2 LSWAG has the highest oil recovery compared to conventional high salinity waterflood, high salinity WAG injection, and low salinity waterflood. A number of geological realizations are generated to assess the geological uncertainties effect, in particular clay distribution uncertainties, on CO2 LSWAG efficiency. Finally, LSWAG injection strategies is optimized by identifying key important factors such as injected water salinity, WAG ratio, CO2 and water slug sizes. Application This model was built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for screening, design, optimization, and uncertainty assessment of process performance from laboratory to and field scales. Significance of Subject Matter CO2 LSWAG is a promising EOR technique as it not only combines the benefits of gas and low salinity water floods but also promotes the synergy between these processes through the interactions between geochemical reactions associated with CO2 injection, ion exchange process, and wettability alteration. This paper demonstrates the merits of this process through modeling, optimization and uncertainty assessment. "

                    "abstract": "To improve sweep efficiency for carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) up to 120°C in the presence of high-salinity brine (182 g/L NaCl), novel CO2/water (C/W) foams have been formed with surfactants composed of ethoxylated amine headgroups with cocoalkyl tails. These surfactants are switchable from the nonionic (unprotonated amine) state in dry CO2 to cationic (protonated amine) in the presence of an aqueous phase with a pH less than 6. The high hydrophilicity in the protonated cationic state was evident in the high cloudpoint temperature up to 120°C. The high cloudpoint facilitated stabilization of lamellae between bubbles in CO2/water foams. In the nonionic form, the surfactant was soluble in CO2 at 120°C, and 3,300 psia at a concentration of 0.2% (w/w). C/W foams were produced by injecting the surfactant into either the CO2 phase or the brine phase, which indicated good contact between phases for transport of surfactant to the interface. Solubility of the surfactant in CO2 and a favorable C/W partition coefficient are beneficial for transport of surfactant with CO2-flow pathways in the reservoir, to minimize viscous fingering and gravity override. The ethoxylated cocoamine with two ethylene oxide (EO) groups was shown to stabilize C/W foams in a 30-darcy sandpack with NaCl concentrations up to 182 g/L at 120°C, 3,400 psia, and foam qualities from 50 to 95%. The foam produces an apparent viscosity of 6.2 cp in the sandpack and 6.3 cp in a 762-µm-inner-diameter capillary tube (downstream of the sandpack) in contrast with values well below 1 cp without surfactant present. Moreover, the cationic headgroup reduces the adsorption of ethoxylated alkyl amines on calcite, which is also positively charged in the presence of CO2 dissolved in brine. The surfactant partition coefficients (0 to 0.04) favored the water phase over the oil phase, which is beneficial for minimizing losses of surfactant to the oil phase for efficient surfactant usage. Furthermore, the surfactant was used to form C/W foams, without forming stable/viscous oil/water (O/W) emulsions. This selectivity is desirable for mobility control whereby CO2 will have low mobility in regions in which oil is not present and high contact with oil at the displacement front. In summary, the switchable ethoxylated alkyl amine surfactants provide both high cloudpoints in brine and high interfacial activities of ionic surfactants in water for foam generation, as well as significant solubilities in CO2 in the nonionic dry state for surfactant injection.

                    "abstract": "Summary Low salinity waterflooding (LSW) is an emerging enhanced oil recovery technique in which the salinity of the injected water is controlled to improve oil recovery vs. conventional, higher salinity waterflooding. Despite significant growing interest in LSW, a consistent mechanistic study has not yet emerged, and the mechanisms behind the LSW process have been debated for the last decade due to the complexity of the crude oil-brine-rock interactions. The intent of this paper is to: Introduction Waterflooding is currently accepted worldwide as a simple, reliable, and economic technique; most of conventional oil reservoirs have been, are being, or will be considered for waterflooding during secondary recovery. Unquestionably, waterflooding will continue to be applied to unlock huge hydrocarbon reserves left behind by primary recovery. In most waterflooding projects, especially in offshore oil fields, the injected brine is normally chosen to be compatible with the existing reservoir brine so that damage to the formation does not occur. However, several authors have reported that injecting low salinity brine can increase oil recovery, compared to conventional high salinity waterflooding in sandstone reservoirs. The original ideas of LSW came from Morrow and his research colleagues at the University of Wyoming in the early 1990's during their experiments to determine the interactions and effects of brine, crude oil, and mineralogy on wettability (Morrow, etal., 1998). Subsequently, numerous evaluations in laboratories and in the fields have proven the possibility of higher oil recovery factor by LSW. Although people widely agree with this point, the underlying mechanisms of additional oil recovery are still being debated. Several hypotheses have been proposed during last two decades including fines migration, wettability alteration, multi-component ionic exchange (MIE), pH modification, desorption, and double layer effects. Up to now, the mechanism responsible for increased oil recovery is poorly understood with many contradictory published results. "

                    "abstract": "Low salinity waterflood (LSW) has become an attractive enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method as it shows more advantages than conventional chemical EOR methods in terms of chemical costs, environmental impact, and field process implementation. Extensive laboratory studies in the past two decades have proposed several pore-scale mechanisms of oil displacement during LSW flooding, which are still open for discussion. However, the capability of reservoir simulators to model accurately this process is very limited. This paper provides a critical review of the state of the art in research and field applications of LSW. The focus is on a widely agreed mechanism that is the wettability alteration from preferential oil wetness to water wetness of formation rock surfaces. Ion exchange and geochemical reactions have been experimentally found to be important in oil mobilization due to enhanced water spreading at low salinity. To evaluate the significance of this surface wetting mechanism, a comprehensive ion exchange model with geochemical processes has been developed and coupled to the multi-phase multi-component flow equations in an equation-of-state compositional simulator. This new model captures most of the important physical and chemical phenomena that occur in LSW, including intra-aqueous reactions, mineral dissolution/precipitation, ion exchange and wettability alteration. The proposed LSW model is tested using the low-salinity core-flood experiments reported by Fjelde et al. (2012) for a North Sea reservoir and the low-salinity and high-salinity heterogeneous core-flood experiments by Rivet (2009) for a Texas reservoir. Excellent agreements between the model and the experiments in terms of effluent ion concentrations, effluent pH, and oil recovery were achieved. In addition, the model was also proved to be highly comparable with the ion-exchange model of the geochemistry software PHREEQC for both low salinity and high salinity (Appelo, 1994). Important observations in laboratory and field tests such as local pH increase, decrease in divalent effluent concentration, mineralogy contributions, and the influence of connate water and injected brine compositions can be reproduced with the proposed LSW model. Built in a robust reservoir simulator, it serves as a powerful tool for LSW design and the interpretation of process performance in field tests. "

The LTG processinvolves the use of surfactant and gas to mobilize and then displace residualcrude after waterflood at greatly reduced oil/water interface tension (IFT).This method allows extending surfactant enhanced oil recovery (EOR) insub-20-mD formations in which polymer is impractical because of plugging,shear, or the requirement to use a low-molecular-weight polymer. The proposed strategy is tested through the coinjection of nitrogen and aslug/drive surfactant solution. Results indicate favorable mobilization anddisplacement of residual crude oil in both tight-carbonate and tight-sandstonereservoirs. Tertiary recovery of 75-90% of residual oil in place (ROIP) wasachieved for cores with 2- to 15-mD permeability. High LTG tertiary recovery iscontrasted with results from reference surfactant (no gas) flooding (28% ROIPtertiary recovery) and immiscible gas coinjection (no surfactant) flooding (13%ROIP tertiary recovery). In addition, high initial oil saturation was tested todetermine the process tolerance to oil and to evaluate the potential forapplication during secondary recovery. Under such conditions, this methodachieved recovery of 84% of oil originally in place (OOIP), suggesting thepotential application of this process at secondary recovery. To better understand the physical mechanisms that affect mobilization anddisplacement, the early production of an elongated oil bank at reducedfractional flow of oil was shown to be an attribute of high crude-oil relativemobility and low pore volume (PV) available to mobile oil. This shouldfavorably affect economics during chemical flooding by accelerating productionof an oil bank. Next, by application of salinity as a conservative tracer andoil material balance, gas saturation during LTG floods was calculated to be 18to 22%. By comparing effluent salinity profiles across floods, a qualitativeunderstanding of in-situ fluid dispersion associated with macroscopicdisplacement stability is developed. The results indicate that in-situ foamingwas present, which enabled mobility control, and that stable displacement ofin-situ fluids was achieved during flooding. "

The modeling of nanoparticle transport in hydrocarbon reservoirs requires a comprehensive understanding of the rheological behavior of these nanofluids. Silica nanoparticles have been commonly used because of their low-cost fabrication and cost-effective surface modification. The aqueous silica-nanoparticle dispersions show Newtonian behavior under steady shear measurements controlled by a rheometer, as discussed by Metin et al. (2011b). The viscosity of nanoparticle dispersions depends strongly on the particle concentration, and that this correlation can be depicted by a unified rheological model (Metin et al. 2011b). In addition, during flow in permeable media, the variation of shear associated with complex pore morphology and the interactions between the nanoparticles and tortuous flow channels can affect the viscosity of nanoparticle dispersion. The latter is particularly important if the concentration of nanoparticles in dispersion may change because of nanoparticle adsorption on mineral/fluid and oil/water interfaces or by mechanical trapping of nanoparticles. In this paper, the flow of silicananoparticle dispersions through different permeable media is investigated. The rheological behaviors of the dispersions are compared with those determined by use of a rheometer. We established a correlation between the nanoparticle concentration and dispersion viscosity in porous media for various nanoparticle sizes. The effects of pore structure and shear rate are also studied. We have confirmed that the concept of effective maximum packing fraction can be applied to describe the viscosity of aqueous nanoparticle dispersions in both bulk flow and flow in porous media with high permeability and regular pore structures, but not at low permeability because of mechanical trapping. Our work provides new insight to engineering nanoparticle rheology for subsurface applications. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of the effect of surfactant partitioning between supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) and water on surfactant transport and foam propagation during a two-phase flow. A series of corefloods was conducted on Silurian dolomite cores with different nonionic and anionic surfactants that represent respective wide ranges of partition coefficients and solubility in SCCO2. Foam robustness (i.e., rate of foam development) and displacement efficiency were related to these surfactant properties. Coreflood results and all measured surfactant properties were used in a commercial reservoir simulator to determine the variation of the surfactant-partitioning effect from laboratory to field scale. The optimization of the surfactant-partition coefficient for field-scale foam process was performed with different injection strategies. The results from this study enable us to tailor the properties of CO2-soluble surfactants (i.e., partition coefficients) to a wide range of reservoir conditions and optimal injection strategies. The understanding of the surfactant-partitioning effect is also important in overcoming technical challenges encountered in the injection of surfactant in CO2. The partition between CO2 and water phases was much more sensitive to surfactant structure than temperature and pressure. Strong foam development was observed for all nonionic and anionic surfactants, whereas an increase in surfactant-partition coefficient lowered the rate of foam propagation. Field-scale foam simulations indicate that foam performance and surfactant transport are governed not only by constrained injection strategies, but also by a surfactant-partition coefficient. This novel CO2-soluble-surfactant concept diversifies injection strategies with respect to operational constraints, thus broadening the application of foam process. For a given injection strategy, a surfactant-partition coefficient could be optimized to improve injectivity and sweep efficiency. The optimal partition of the surfactant between the CO2 and aqueous phases minimizes the wasting of expensive surfactant in water that never comes in contact with CO2. "

                    "title": "Successful Test of Low-Tension-Gas (LTG) Flooding for Tertiary Oil Recovery in Tight Formations (<10mD to Gas",
                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper establishes Low-Tension-Gas (LTG) as a method for sub-miscible tertiary recovery in tight sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. The LTG process involves the use of a low foam quality surfactant-gas solution to mobilize and then displace residual crude after waterflood. It replicates the existing Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) process in its creation of an ultra low oil-water interfacial tension (IFT) environment for oil mobilization, but instead supplements the use of foam over polymer for mobility control. By replacing polymer with foam, chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods can be expanded into sub-30 mD formations where polymer is impractical due to plugging, shear, or the requirement to use a low molecular weight polymer. The proposed strategy is tested through low-quality, low rate co-injection of nitrogen and a slug/drive surfactant solution. Results indicate favorable mobilization and displacement of residual crude oil in both tight carbonate and tight sandstone reservoirs. Tertiary recovery of 75-90% ROIP was achieved for cores with 2-15 mD permeability. Consistent with successful ASP floods typically observed in high permeability rocks, a large oil bank was observed at the effluent before the production of Windsor Type III and Type II(-) microemulsion. High LTG tertiary recovery is contrasted with results from reference surfactant (no gas) flooding (28% ROIP tertiary recovery) and immiscible gas co-injection (no surfactant) flooding (28% ROIP tertiary recovery). Additionally, high initial oil saturation was tested to determine process tolerance to oil and evaluate potential for application during secondary recovery. During flooding at initial oil saturation (1-Swi), LTG injection achieved recovery of 84% of OOIP with similar fractional flow, mobility, and other process attributes to those exhibited during LTG tertiary flooding. This reduces the risk that in-situ oil may cause unfavorable displacement due to destabilization of liquid lamellae which provide mobility control by creation of a dispersed gas phase (foam). Potential application at secondary recovery is suggested which would improve reserve capture and reduce high pressure gradients typically associated with flooding tight reservoirs. To better understand the physical mechanisms which impact mobilization and displacement, early production of an elongate oil bank at reduced fractional flow of oil was shown to be an attribute of high crude oil relative mobility and low pore volume available to mobile oil. This should favorably impact economics during chemical flooding by accelerating production of an oil bank. Next, by application of salinity as a conservative tracer and oil material balance, gas saturation during LTG floods was calculated to be 18-22%. This is contrasted with gas saturation during co-injection of 5% and indicates that a large dispersed gas phase was present during LTG flooding and is consistent with stable lamellae production during flooding. Finally, by comparing effluent salinity profiles across floods, qualitative understanding of dispersion and macroscopic stability is developed. Plots show a reduction in dispersion for LTG flooding versus surfactant flooding, which indicates improvement in mobility ratios across the displacement fronts. Macroscopic stability of displacement fronts was studied via pressure derived mobility ratios. Approximate parity of relative mobility of injected fluids was observed with respect to relative mobility of displaced water at true residual oil saturation and interpreted relative mobility of a formed oil bank. These results indicate that in-situ foaming was present which enabled mobility control, and that stable displacement of in-situ fluids was achieved during flooding. "

                    "title": "Modeling of Foamed Gas Mobility in Permeable Porous Media",
                    "abstract": "Abstract In mechanistic modeling of foam in porous media, reduced gas mobility is attributed to viscous resistance of flowing foam lamellas to gas flow, while gas trapping significantly modifies relative permeability. By using pore-network models representative of real porous media, we previously developed a relationship between flowing gas fraction and pressure gradient for strong foam (high lamella density). In this study, we expand our model to describe the effects of foam strength and pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models on both relative gas permeability and effective gas viscosity. Dimensional analysis in scaling of these two rheological quantities with pressure gradient and lamella density is discussed.  One of our important findings is that relative gas permeability is poorly sensitive to total lamella density while it is a strong non-linear function of flowing gas fraction, opposing to most of the existing theoretical models describing the effect of gas trapping on relative gas permeability. This is consistently observed for all the pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models. It is also found that effective gas viscosity increases exponentially with flowing lamella density. This result implies that the use of the commonly used apparent gas viscosity model for straight capillary tubes is not accurate for foam flow in porous media.  In addition, shear thinning foam flow is more obvious at high flowing lamella density while Newtonian flow becomes significant at relatively low flowing lamella density. Furthermore, scaling of effective gas viscosity with flowing lamella density depends on how the later quantity is defined. Both empirical and mechanistic pore-scale apparent gas viscosity models give almost the same functional relationship between flowing gas fraction and pressure gradient. This would facilitate scaling of flow rate with pressure gradient and testing a range of shear-thinning and yield-stress behavior in a simple format. Our results necessitate the need for further improving the existing mechanistic foam modeling methods with focus on process upscaling.  Introduction Aqueous foam flooding is an effective technique to control gas mobility in permeable porous media with successful applications to improving volumetric sweep efficiency in miscible/immiscible gas flooding and steam flooding (Schramm, 1994; Rossen, 1996; Patzek, 1996). Recently, foam has proved to be the low-cost alternative to polymer in chemical flooding in difficult reservoir conditions such as very low permeability rocks and high temperature (Srivastava and Nguyen, 2010; Srivastava et al., 2010). In addition to the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications, foam has been routinely used to direct flow of cleaning fluids such as surfactant and acid solutions in aquifer remediation (Hirasaki et al., 2000) and well stimulation (Gdanski, 1993), respectively.  The physical principle of foam-induced fluid mobility control in the above applications is based on the resistance of aqueous foam films (or lamellas) to gas flow and the reduction of available flow area to gas and liquid phases due to gas trapping during multi-phase flow. Experimental studies show that the flowing gas fraction in foam in porous media ranges from 50% to less than 1% (Radke and Gillis, 1990; Friedmann et al., 1991; Tang and Kovscek, 2006; Nguyen et al., 2009; Kil et al., 2011). The flowing gas moves in discrete \"bubble trains?? through beds of trapped bubbles (Falls et al., 1989). The gas blocking in porous media results from the resistance of individual lamellas to stretching and the pressure difference across them. Lamellas move to the pore throats, if foam is at rest, due to the gas diffusion between bubbles (Rossen, 1996; Cohen et al., 1997). Resistance to the movement of a lamella is at highest level at the pore throat as it scales with the inverse of the pore-throat radius. The capacity of foam-induced fluid blocking on a field scale in acid diversion, reduction of gas channeling, and reduced liquid injectivity in surfactant alternating gas (SAG) process is thus strongly influenced by the level of gas trapping. Moreover, accurate prediction of flowing gas fraction under reservoir conditions plays a major role in designing mass exchange between injected gas and oil in place in miscible gas processes. "

                    "title": "Understanding Foam Flow With a New Foam EOR Model Developed From Laboratory and Field Data of the Naturally Fractured Cantarell Field",
                    "abstract": "Abstract As much of the oil in the Akal field of the Cantarell complex is contained in the low permeability oil wet matrix, foam injection has been proposed as a method to control fluid mobility in the fracture, with the possible added benefit of transporting surfactant into the matrix so that additional oil could be liberated through a reduction of interfacial tension between oil and water (if this effect is significant for the surfactant in question). Presented in this paper is the work flow undertaken during an extensive study of all available laboratory experiments and pilot single well foam injection tests. Laboratory experiments ranged from simple water plus surfactant imbibition tests and surfactant flooding tests, to more complex foam flooding in split core experiments and co-injection of surfactant and gas for generation of foam in-situ. There were three field pilot single well foam injection tests that were included in this analysis that were of the huff-and-puff design. This extensive analysis was done with the aid of numerical simulation that resulted in the development of a novel foam model that handles both mobility control and interfacial tension reduction effects, and is capable of simulating foam degradation, foam regeneration, and trapped foam phenomena. Previous foam models available in commercial numerical simulators were not capable of simulating all of these foam effects together. It is shown that with identical foam parameters, this model matches all laboratory core flood studies as well as the field pilot tests, showing that this foam model is capable of predicting foam performance in both laboratory and field settings. The foam components can be chosen to be defined as either gaseous or aqueous components and this choice is shown to affect the impact of capillary pressure on foam flow into the matrix.  Also discussed in this paper are details of how the foam behaves when injected into a gas saturated zone where the foam combines with in-situ gas, resulting in higher foam qualities than was injected. It is demonstrated that foam mobility control as a function of foam quality is an important aspect for matching field performance. The significance of correct foam density calculations is also discussed using field scale models.  The work done to match the many laboratory and field scale foam tests resulted in a significant improvement of the understanding of foam degradation, regeneration, permeability blockage, and flow in porous media and the phenomena responsible for generating incremental oil.  Introduction Foam as a means for mobility control has long been recognized as a promising aid to EOR processes17,18,19,20,. There have been many field tests of steam foam22,23and CO2 foam. One of the most successful demonstrations of foam mobility control was in the Snorre field24. Foam was used as mobility control for surfactant aquifer remediation at Hill Air Force Base in Utah25,26. Foam was used as mobility control for alkaline surfactant flooding in China27,28. A favorable property of foam in heterogeneous porous media is that in-situ foam generation will occur in the high permeability zones first, thereby causing more fluid to flow to lower permeability zones. This behavior was confirmed by Casteel and Djabbarah29, Llave et al30, and Zerhboub et al31. When rocks of different permeabilities are in capillary contact and cross-flow between these zones can occur, such as the case with fractured systems, foam moves with equal velocity in both the low and high permeability regions32,33.

                    "title": "Ethoxylated Cationic Surfactants For CO2 EOR In High Temperature, High Salinity Reservoirs",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Despite significant interest in CO2 foams for EOR, very few studies have reported stable foams at high temperatures and high salinities, which are often encountered in the Middle East and elsewhere. Stable CO2/water (C/W) foams at high temperatures up to 120 oC and salinities have been achieved with ethoxylated cationic surfactants. The surfactants were shown to stabilize C/W foams with high salinity brine with NaCl concentration up to 182 g/L at 120 °C, 3400 psia, and to form unstable dodecane/water emulsions with the 120 g/L NaCl brine solutions. Thus, the foams have the potential to provide mobility control to prevent loses of CO2 in high permeability regions, but simultaneously allow high permeability in the presence of residual oil. The surfactants are soluble in CO2 and thus may be injected in the CO2 phase to simplify the EOR process. The aqueous solubility of the surfactant at high temperatures is enhanced with the appropriate number of EO groups on the amine head group. Viscosities of high-pressure C/W foams (emulsions) formed with these surfactants were investigated by capillary rheology. These hybrid cationic/nonionic surfactants combine the high cloud points of ionic surfactants with high solubilities in CO2 of nonionic surfactants. Furthermore, the variation of the tail length and the degree of ethoxylation offer great flexibility for stabilizing CO2 foams for EOR at high temperatures and high salinities. Ethoxylated cocoamine exhibited lower adsorption on calcite than that on dolomite, given the presence of silica sites in the latter. High divalent ion concentrations in 22% total dissolved solids (TDS) brine contributed to the reduction of surfactant adsorption on silica sites in the dolomite powder.  Introduction The interest in CO2 EOR has grown significantly over the past 30 years throughout the world (Stevens, Kunskraa et al. 1999; Gozalpour, Ren et al. 2005; Enick and Olsen 2012). The sweep efficiency for oil recovery can be improved by raising the viscosity of CO2 relative to oil and water by forming CO2/water foams. These foams may be considered to be C/W emulsions given the moderate CO2 density and substantial solvent strength of CO2 (Rossen 1996; Zhu, Ogbe et al. 2004). Nonionic surfactant are often soluble in the CO2 phase and may be injected in the CO2 phase (Wolthers, Charlet et al. 2008; Adkins, Chen et al. 2010) However, the cloud points of ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are typically well below 120 °C. Above the cloud point temperature, precipitation of the surfactant from water limits the ability of the surfactant to stabilize water lamellae in CO2/water foams (Adkins, Chen et al. 2010). Although ionic surfactants may potentially have high cloud points, solubilities of ionic surfactants are very limited in CO2 (Gupta and Shim 2007).  Another major challenge is to limit adsorption of surfactant on positively charged limestone surfaces at pH values on the order of 4-5 produced by dissolved CO2 in the aqueous phase (Holmes, Ziegler et al. 1999). Cationic surfactants may exhibit significantly less adsorption on carbonate minerals than that exhibited by anionic surfactants as a result of electrostatic repulsion(Tabatabal, Gonzalez et al. 1993). However, these surfactants are rarely soluble in CO2, although a few exceptions have been reported (Smith, Dhanuka et al. 2007). Given all these limitations, it remains a major challenge to design CO2 soluble surfactants that form C/W foams at high temperature with small levels of adsorption on limestone surfaces. "

Ultimately, the process can improve the profitability of existing wells by enhancing reservoir sweep efficiency, thereby allowing access to previously bypassed oil.  This report describes the technology development process and documents successful field trial results from Kinder Morgan's SACROC field.  Introduction Operators are demanding solutions that maximize recovery from existing reservoirs, capturing the high value of remaining oil and avoiding the risk and high costs associated with new exploration.  A new conformance solution has been developed to help producers reach and recover more oil from existing wells while simultaneously reducing operating expenditures.  This report describes an experimental field trial of a new technology to address shortcomings associated with existing miscible gas EOR processes by generating foams of supercritical CO2 fluid and water in the formation to alter mobility and improve vertical conformance.  The history match and foam modeling work for the project are discussed, including the forecasted production curves derived from the optimization of the injection strategy. A field trial was carried out in west Texas at the Scurry Area Canyon Reef Operational Committee (SACROC) field, which is owned and operated by Kinder Morgan LLC.  The purpose of the program was to use surfactant injection in the CO2 phase to create a CO2-in-water emulsion or foamto improve vertical conformance, and create in-depth mobility control.  The project was funded independently by The Dow Chemical Company and Kinder Morgan LLC and was not part of a government subsidized program or grant. Background The SACROC field had an estimated original oil in place (OOIP) of 2.8Billion barrels, when it was discovered in 1948 (Mathis 1964).  Primary production and a successful waterflood yielded 1.2B barrels of oil from the 1950's through the 1970's (Kane 1979).  Aspects of the field's history have been covered previously including: field characteristics, CO2 project planning and design, reservoir and fluid properties, and this paper will only briefly discuss aspects as they are relevant to the current discussion (Simon and Fesmire 1977, Crameik 1972, Chaback and Williams 1988, Swulius 1986, Gill 1982).  The SACROC field has been under CO2 flood since 1972.  Production in the field had been on a steady decline prior to being purchased by Kinder Morgan in 2001, when its production had decreased to ~8500 b/d.  Through the use of a miscible CO2 5-spot pattern injection program, Kinder Morgan was able to increase production to ~32,000 b/d by 2002 and is currently producing 28,000 BOPD) (Brnak and Petrich et al. 2006).

                    "abstract": "Many operations involve the injection of fluids into the formation around a well. In many cases, the fluids contain colloidal particles, either initially present or introduced during the operation through dirt or naturally occurring particles. Therefore, all injection schemes potentially suffer from injectivity decline. This injectivity decline is caused by clogging of the formation by particles, forming an external filter cake on the surface of the formation and blocking the pores inside the formation. This paper reports on the effects of gas on the injectivity of particles in sandstone. Experiments were performed in which water containing micron-sized particles (hematite) was injected into sandstone cores with or without small gas bubbles (nitrogen) present in the water. The position and amount of particle deposition could be determined both visually and by chemical analysis. It was found that the presence of gas reduces the external filter cake formed on the inlet surface of the core. Also, with gas, the particles penetrate deeper inside the core and more particles pass through the core and are detected in the effluent stream. The same effects are enhanced when the mixture of gas bubbles and water is replaced by foam. This suggests that the presence of gas/water interfaces has a major influence on the retention of particles in the sandstone. Possible mechanisms are discussed. The pressure drop across the core when gas or foam is present is initially higher than in an identical test without gas because of relative permeability effects or foam-flow resistance. However, because fewer particles are retained, ultimately the pressure drop is significantly less when gas is present. This effect may be significant in injection operations involving foam and offers ways to mitigate injectivity loss. "

The main objective of this research is to investigate the flow characteristics of heterogeneous reservoirs in which solvent is more likely to lower SOR of SAGD. SAGD and ES-SAGD with normal hexane are simulated for fifty geostatistical realizations consisting of clean sand and shale, qualitatively representative of the middle member of the McMurray formation. Thermodynamic models are calibrated with experimental phase behavior data for reliable comparison between SAGD and ES-SAGD, including the water solubility in oil at elevated temperatures. Results show that the SOR reduction by steam-solvent coinjection is positively correlated with the increase in SAGD's SOR due to heterogeneity. Enhancement of bitumen flow by dilution is more important for lowering SOR for those reservoirs in which the permeability variation makes slow-flow regions during SAGD. Simulation results show that a larger amount of bitumen tends to be diluted by solvent in those reservoirs for which SAGD exhibits slow production of bitumen. Then, the observed results are analyzed by use of SAGD analytical equations that clarify several influential factors for bitumen flow beyond the edge of a steam chamber. It is shown that dilution of bitumen by solvent in steam-solvent coinjection becomes more significant where flow barriers limit the local bitumen flow under SAGD even at high temperatures. In such slow-flow regions, the bitumen flow rate can be substantially increased by accumulation of solvent in ES-SAGD, which reduces the oleic-phase viscosity and increases the oleic-phase saturation and, therefore, relative permeability. Solvent accumulation within a steam chamber can also reduce thermal losses because of lower operating-chamber temperatures. "

                    "title": "Emulsification of Athabasca bitumen by organic alkali: Emulsion phase behavior and viscosity for bitumen/brine/triethylenetetramine",
                    "abstract": "Recovery of bitumen commonly uses steam assisted-gravity drainage, in which water throughput is intrinsically high. A large amount of condensed water near thermal fronts tends to substantially decrease the effective permeability to bitumen in the conventional gravity drainage process. This research investigates a potential way to use the condensed-water phase as an effective carrier for bitumen by making oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. The expected mechanism depends on emulsification of bitumen into the water phase by natural surfactants that are generated through reactions of acidic oil components with organic alkali. The main objective of this paper is to study the ability of an organic alkali to create o/w emulsions that are much more mobile than the original bitumen. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) was selected as organic alkali for this paper with no other additives. The main contribution of this paper is a new set of experimental data (phase behavior and viscosities) for emulsions for mixtures of Athabasca bitumen, TETA, and NaCl brine at a wide range of alkali concentrations, salinities, and water-to-oil ratios (WORs) at temperatures up to 373 K. Results show that the o/w emulsions created by TETA can be an effective bitumen carrier with a low viscosity and high bitumen content in the emulsion. It is possible to create o/w emulsions by adding a small amount of TETA to Athabasca bitumen and NaCl brine. Single-phase o/w emulsions, which are desirable as a bitumen carrier, were observed for TETA concentrations below 5.0 wt% at salinities 0 ppm and 1000 ppm at 373 K. The bitumen content in o/w emulsion was the highest for 2.0 wt% TETA samples, and it increased with increasing temperature. In comparison to the original bitumen, o/w emulsions were 4–5 orders of magnitude less viscous at 298 K, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less viscous at 323 K, and 1 to 2 orders of magnitude less viscous at 353 K.

                    "abstract": "Water is the dominant component in steam injection processes, such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The central hypothesis in this research is that in-situ oil transport can be enhanced by generating oil-in-water emulsion, where the water-continuous phase acts as an effective oil carrier. As part of the research project, this paper presents an experimental study of how oil-in-water emulsion can improve oil transport in porous media at elevated temperatures from 373 K to 443 K. Diethyl amine (DEA) was selected as the organic alkali to form oil-in-water emulsions with Athabasca bitumen and NaCl brine at 1000 ppm salinity and 0.5 wt% alkali concentration. This composition had been confirmed to be optimal in terms of oil solubility in the water-external emulsion phase at a wide range of temperatures. Then, flow experiments with a glass-beads pack were conducted to measure effective viscosities for emulsion samples at shear rates from 5 to 29 sec−1. Results show that the oil-in-water emulsions were more than 18 times less viscous than the original bitumen at 373 and 403 K. At an estimated shear rate of 5 sec−1, for example, the emulsion viscosity was 12 cp at 373 K, at which the bitumen viscosity was 273 cp. The efficiency of in-situ bitumen transport was evaluated by calculating bitumen molar flow rate under gravity drainage with the new experimental data. Results show that oil-in-water emulsion can enhance in-situ molar flow of bitumen by a factor of 64 at 403 K and 95 at 373 K, in comparison with the gravity drainage of oil-water two phases in conventional SAGD. This is mainly because the mobility of the bitumen-containing phase is enhanced by the reduced viscosity and increased effective permeability. A marked difference between alkaline solvents and conventional hydrocarbon solvents is that only a small amount of alkaline solvent enables to enhance in-situ transport of bitumen. "

                    "abstract": "Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a widely-used method for heavy-oil and bitumen recovery. Analytical SAGD models presented in the literature often overestimate bitumen-production rate substantially. Although bitumen-production rate and steam-oil ratio (SOR) depend significantly on temperature near the steam-chamber edge in SAGD, previous analytical models assumed the injected-steam temperature to uniformly distribute along the edge of a steam chamber. The main objective of this research is to develop the first analytical SAGD model that takes into account temperature variation along the edge of a steam chamber. Local material balance and Darcy’s law are applied to each cross section perpendicular to the edge of a steam chamber. Then, they are coupled with the global material balance for the chamber geometry that is an inverted triangle. New analytical equations are presented for bitumen-production rate and SOR, in addition to associated variables as functions of elevation from the production well, such as oil-flow rate and temperature along a linear chamber edge. Bitumen-production rate and SOR can be calculated for a representative chamber-edge temperature at a certain elevation from the production well. Comparison of the analytical model with numerical simulations shows that bitumen-production rate and SOR can be accurately estimated when the new model is used with the temperature taken from the midpoint of the edge of a steam chamber. The chamber-edge temperature used for the new analytical model that gives accurate results can be up to 100 Kelvin lower than the injected steam temperature for a given operating pressure in the cases tested. The previous assumption of the injected-steam temperature at the chamber edge gives overestimated oil-production rates for SAGD. The constant temperature along the edge of a steam chamber gives Butler’s concave interface of a steam chamber that is detached from the production well. For a chamber to exhibit a linear interface, temperature must vary along the chamber edge, which occurs in reality mainly because of heat losses to the over- and under-burden formations. "

                    "abstract": "Water is the most dominant component in steam-based oil recovery methods, such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The central question that motivated this research is whether in-situ bitumen transport in SAGD can be substantially enhanced by generating oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion, in which the water-continuous phase acts as an effective bitumen carrier. As part of the initial stage of the research project, the main objective of this paper is to present the ability of organic alkali to form oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions that are substantially less viscous than the original bitumen. Experimental studies were conducted for emulsion phase behavior and viscosity for mixtures of Athabasca bitumen, organic alkali, and NaCl brine. Experimental variables included brine salinity, alkali concentration, water-to-oil (WOR) ratio, temperature, and sample-aging time. The phase behavior study indicated that conditions conducive to o/w emulsions are low alkali concentrations at salinities below 1,000 ppm. At a WOR of 7:3, a single phase of o/w emulsion was observed for 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 wt% alkali with no NaCl, and 0.5 wt% alkali at a salinity of 1,000 ppm at 373 K. At lower temperatures, 323 K and 298 K, flocculation of emulsions in these samples resulted in separation between the bitumen-rich and water-rich o/w emulsions. However, essentially all bitumen content was measured from the bitumen-rich o/w emulsion. The oil contents in these emulsions were more than 70 vol.% at 298 K and 57 vol.% at 323 K. Viscosities of these o/w emulsions ranged between 85 cp and 115 cp at 1.0 s−1, and between 31 cp and 34 cp at 10.0 s−1 at 323 K. At 298 K, they ranged between 105 cp and 250 cp at 1.0 s−1 and between 48 cp and 74 cp at 10.0 s−1. Results in this research show that, in comparison with the original bitumen, bitumen-rich o/w emulsions were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude less viscous at 298 K, and 2 orders of magnitude less viscous at 323 K.

                    "abstract": "Coinjection of solvent with steam results in lower chamber-edge temperatures than those in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), which enables the decrease of heat losses to the overlying formation rocks. However, use of highly volatile solvents, such as propane, can yield significantly slow bitumen production because of low chamber-edge temperatures. The suitability of alkane solvents for SAGD in terms of phase behavior has been reported to increase with increasing carbon number and tends to level off at a certain carbon number, which is approximately C6 for Athabasca bitumen reservoirs. The main objective of this research is to investigate the potential of dimethyl ether (DME), a water-soluble solvent, as an additive to steam for reducing steam/oil ratio (SOR) while keeping SAGD-like rates of bitumen production. The chamber-edge temperature for a given overall composition and operating pressure is defined as the temperature at which the vapor phase completely condenses with decreasing temperature. Thermodynamic predictions show that the chamber-edge temperature so defined will increase substantially if the solvent can partition into the aqueous phase at chamber-edge conditions. This is confirmed in numerical-reservoir simulation for coinjection of steam with DME, as a water-soluble solvent, for Athabasca bitumen. In simulation case studies, coinjection of steam with DME (DME-SAGD) is compared with SAGD and coinjection of steam with C4 (C4-SAGD), in terms of SOR, bitumen production, local displacement efficiency, and solvent recovery. The steam-injection pressure is 35 bar for all cases, and 2 mol% of solvent is coinjected in solvent-SAGD simulations until the steam chamber reaches the side boundary of a 2D homogeneous reservoir model. Because the DME volatility is between C3 and C4, C4 is selected as the alkane counterpart in this simulation study to see the effect of the solvent solubility in water on oil recovery in solvent-SAGD. DME is more volatile and less soluble in bitumen than C4 at their corresponding chamber-edge conditions. However, results show that DME-SAGD results in 35% lower SOR than SAGD while being able to increase bitumen-production rates of SAGD. Analysis of simulation results indicates that the solubility of DME in water not only makes the chamber-edge temperature higher than that of C4-SAGD, but also yields 15% higher solvent-recovery factor than C4-SAGD. The main reason for the latter observation is that a much-smaller fraction of the injected solvent is present in the vapor phase in DME-SAGD than in C4-SAGD. Also, DME dissolves in both water and bitumen, which results in the aqueous and oleic phases of nearly equal density within the gravity-drainage zone near the edge of a steam chamber. This is the neutral regime of oil/water two-phase flow along the chamber edge between the two extreme cases: SAGD and C4-SAGD. Unlike in C4-SAGD, the reduced gravity segregation in DME-SAGD is expected to facilitate the mixing of condensed solvent with bitumen near the edge of a steam chamber. "

This paper presents a new set of experimental data for phase equilibrium, viscosity, density, and asphaltene precipitation for 11 mixtures of Athabasca bitumen with n-hexane and 10 mixtures of the same bitumen with n-octane. Phase-boundary measurements were conducted at temperatures up to 160°C and pressures up to 10 MPa. The bitumen sample used in this research was studied in our previous research, in which the same bitumen was not effectively diluted by n-butane because of the coexistence of a butane-rich liquid with a bitumen-rich liquid phase. In this research, the liquid/liquid separation of hydrocarbons was not observed for n-hexane/bitumen (HB) and n-octane/bitumen (OB) mixtures for the range of temperatures and pressures tested, even at solvent concentrations higher than 90 mol%. This observation indicates that the amount of solvent available near the edge of a steam chamber is expected to be entirely used for bitumen dilution beyond the chamber edge in coinjection of steam with heavier hydrocarbon solvents, such as n-hexane and n-octane. Experiments for asphaltene precipitation at atmospheric pressure showed a larger amount of precipitates with n-hexane than with n-octane at a given solvent concentration higher than 50 wt%.

                    "abstract": "Phase behavior of shale fluids in small pores is not well understood. One complexity comes from the fact that sorption of components by organic-rich shale can be significant and selective. In an attempt to elucidate the effect of sorption on phase behavior of shale fluids, we present a new experimental method that can be used to measure the bubble-point pressures of N2/n-C4H10 mixtures in the presence of an actual shale sample. Pressure/volume (P/V) isotherms for a given mixture were firstly measured in a PVT cell. Then, the measurements of the P/V isotherms for the same mixture were repeated in a partially confined space by opening a valve between the PVT cell and a shale container. The so-called partially confined space consists of the pore space inside the shale sample, the bulk space in the PVT cell and in the connecting tubing, and the non-cementing pore spaces among the shale particles. Results show that, the measured bubble-point pressure of the N2/n-C4H10 mixture in the partially confined space was higher than the corresponding bubble-point pressure in the bulk space. A detailed analysis indicates that, when loaded in the partially confined space, n-C4H10 exhibits a higher level of sorption capacity on the shale sample than N2, resulting in a higher concentration of N2 left in the free fluid than that in the initial mixture, which is the so-called selective sorption. The higher concentration of N2 led to the higher bubble-point pressure as observed in the measurements. The increase of the bubble-point pressure due to the selective sorption was observed to be greater at a lower temperature. This is because the sorption of n-C4H10 relative to that of N2 is more significant at a lower temperature. A higher temperature did not lead to a higher increment in the bubble-point pressure likely because bubble-point is more sensitive to composition than to temperature for these mixtures at the conditions tested. This emphasizes the importance of considering sorption in phase behavior for small pores. "

                    "abstract": "The conventional method for multiphase flash is the sequential usage of phase-stability and phase-split calculations. Multiphase flash requires the conventional method to obtain multiple false solutions in phase-split calculations and correct them in phase-stability analysis. Improvement of the robustness and efficiency of multiphase flash is important for compositional flow simulation with complex phase behavior. This paper presents a new algorithm that solves for stationary points of the tangent-plane-distance (TPD) function defined at an equilibrium-phase composition for isobaric-isothermal (PT) flash. A solution from the new algorithm consists of two groups of stationary points: tangent and nontangent stationary points of the TPD function. Hence, equilibrium phases, at which the Gibbs free energy is tangent to the TPD function, are found as a subset of the solution. Unlike the conventional method, the new algorithm does not require finding false solutions for robust multiphase flash. The advantage of the new algorithm in terms of robustness is more pronounced for more-complex phase behavior, for which multiple local minima of the Gibbs free energy are present. Case studies show that the new algorithm converges to a lower Gibbs free energy compared with the conventional method for the complex fluids tested. It is straightforward to implement the algorithm because of the simple formulation, which also allows for an arbitrary number of iterative compositions. It can be robustly initialized even when no K value correlation is available for the fluid of interest. Although the main focus of this paper is on robust solution of multiphase flash, the new algorithm can be used to initialize a second-order convergent method in the vicinity of a solution. "

In addition, new experimental data are presented for bubble point pressures, densities, and viscosities of Athabasca bitumen and its mixtures with DME and n-hexane. Results show that DME results in slightly higher viscosity than n-hexane when they are mixed with the same Athabasca bitumen at a given pressure, temperature, and molar concentration. For example, the equimolar mixture of DME with Athabasca bitumen is 79 cp, and that of n-hexane with the same bitumen is 49 cp at 328 K and 60 bars. However, the two solvents are equivalent as diluent at temperatures above 380 K. The new experimental data and previous data in the literature indicate that the viscosity of n-alkanes/bitumen mixtures does not follow the trend given by the classical Arrhenius mixing rule. That is, heavier solvent can give lower viscosity than lighter solvent when they are mixed with the same bitumen at a given pressure, temperature, and molar concentration. Viscosities for DME/bitumen mixtures deviate from the Arrhenius equation more than those for n-hexane/bitumen mixtures. The Arrhenius equation can be modified to correlate the measured data more accurately.

                    "abstract": "Asphaltene is a group of complex compounds commonly present in reservoir fluids, especially in viscous oils. It is conceivable that asphaltene strongly interacts with water through hydrogen bonding, affecting phase behavior of water/oil mixtures with/without forming an asphaltene-rich phase. Modeling of these polar components in reservoir fluids is challenging with cubic equations of state (EOS) due to the size-symmetricity and self- and cross-associations of asphaltene and water. In this research, the cubic-plus-association (CPA) EOS is applied to represent complex multiphase behavior associated with water and asphaltene. Asphaltene-containing heavy oils are characterized by the CPA EOS with four pseudo components (asphaltene and the other three pseudo components) based on their experimental data. Asphaltene is the only associating component in the oil models. Then, multiphase behavior data for mixtures of water with each of these oils are represented by the CPA EOS. Calculated phase behavior by the CPA EOS models is compared with experimental data and also with the Peng-Robinson EOS for several cases. This paper also presents a new correlation for binary interaction parameters (BIPs) for water with n-alkanes for the CPA EOS on the basis of experimental data for three-phase coexistence for water/n-alkane binaries (Brunner 1990). In case studies, the CPA EOS is shown to be able to represent multiphase behavior for water/oil mixtures with up to four equilibrium phases: asphaltene-rich, solvent-rich, aqueous, and vapor phases. In particular, the CPA EOS is successfully applied to bitumen/water mixtures, involving asphaltene-water emulsion, water solubility in bitumen, and their continuous transition with varying temperature. Furthermore, results show that the CPA EOS can reasonably represent the multiphase data measured for a n-butane/bitumen/water mixture that were not accurately correlated with the PR EOS in the literature. Modeling an asphaltene-rich phase in several cases is possible only with consideration of the water-asphaltene interaction, which is worth the additional complexities of the CPA EOS in comparison with the PR EOS.

The main objective of this research is to present a detailed study of compositional mechanisms in SAGD and ES-SAGD simulation by considering xwL. The phase-behavior models used in this research are carefully created on the basis of experimental studies presented in the literature. Mechanistic simulation studies are then conducted for SAGD and ES-SAGD. Coinjectants used in ES-SAGD simulations range from propane through n-decane. Results show that xwL enhances bitumen production in both SAGD and ES-SAGD, mainly because xwL results in reduction of L-phase viscosity. The enhancement is more significant when the chamber-edge temperature is higher, because xwL increases with temperature. The enhancement of bitumen production observed in the case studies is 7.66% for SAGD, 4.08% for n-C6-SAGD, and 4.85% for n-C8-SAGD for a fixed period of operation at 35 bar. It is important to consider xwL in SAGD and ES-SAGD simulations, because the performance of ES-SAGD relative to SAGD tends to be overestimated without considering xwL. A guideline is presented to leverage xwL to improve bitumen production in ES-SAGD. As discussed in our prior research, solvent becomes effective in diluting bitumen and reducing the steam requirement only when it sufficiently accumulates near the chamber edge.

Reliable design of coinjection requires reliable pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) data for bitumen/solvent/water mixtures, which are scarce and fragmentary in the literature. The main objective of this research was to present a new set of PVT and multiphase data for n-butane/Athabasca-bitumen/water mixtures at pressures up to 10 MPa and temperatures up to 160°C. Experiments were conducted with a conventional PVT apparatus. The data presented include multiphase equilibria up to four coexisting phases and liquid densities for 100% bitumen, two mixtures of n-butane/bitumen, and one mixture of n-butane/bitumen/water. Liquid/liquid separation of hydrocarbons was experimentally observed at the n-butane concentration of 97 mol% in the n-butane/bitumen system with/without water, for a wide range of temperatures at operating pressures for expanding-solvent SAGD (ES-SAGD). This may indicate the limited solubility of n-butane in bitumen even when a high level of accumulation of n-butane takes place near a chamber edge in ES-SAGD for Athabasca bitumen. The multiphase transition that involves appearance/disappearance of the vapor phase was observed to occur near the vapor pressure of n-butane or its extension. Such phase transition occurs at a higher pressure in the presence of water, because of its vapor pressure, than in the absence of water at a given temperature. This is the first time four coexisting phases are reported for n-butane/Athabasca-bitumen/water mixtures at temperature/pressure conditions relevant to ES-SAGD. "

                    "abstract": "Expanding-solvent steam-assisted gravity drainage (ES-SAGD) is a widely-investigated alternative to SAGD, considering its potential to reduce thermal losses while enhancing bitumen recovery. However, most prior studies on ES-SAGD were limited to homogeneous reservoirs. This research presents a mechanistic analysis of ES-SAGD in heterogeneous reservoirs in terms of cumulative steam-oil ratio (SOR) as a function of steam-chamber size. Simulation case studies for SAGD and ES-SAGD with normal hexane are conducted for geostatistical realizations of two types of heterogeneous Athabasca-bitumen reservoirs. For the first type, shale barriers are oriented horizontally relative to the top and basal planes of the reservoir. For the second type, they are inclined and more representative of the middle McMurray member. The solubility of water in the oleic phase at elevated temperatures is properly modeled to ensure reliable comparison between SAGD and ES-SAGD. Results show that ES-SAGD is less sensitive to heterogeneity than SAGD in terms of cumulative SOR for simulations at 35 bars and 2 mol% solvent-injection concentration for a reservoir thickness of 20 m. On average, the reduction in SOR due to steam-solvent coinjection is simulated to be greater under heterogeneity. The margin of SOR reduction is greater in reservoirs with inclined shale barriers than in those with horizontal shale barriers. Analysis of simulation results indicates that the injected solvent tends to accumulate more significantly under heterogeneity, which enhances the mechanisms of ES-SAGD, such as dilution of bitumen by solvent and reduced thermal losses to the overburden. Tortuous hydraulic paths and slower gravity drainage under heterogeneity enhance the mixing between solvent and bitumen in the transverse direction along the edge of a steam chamber. Then, a larger amount of the accumulated solvent tends to facilitate lower temperatures near the chamber edge. Lower chamber-edge temperatures combined with restricted access to the overburden under heterogeneity alter the chamber geometry such that the contact area for overburden heat losses is further reduced.

                    "abstract": "Coinjection of solvent with steam results in lower chamber-edge temperatures than those in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), which enable to decrease heat losses to the overlying formation rocks. However, use of highly volatile solvents, such as propane, can yield significantly slow bitumen production due to low chamber-edge temperatures. The objective of this research is to investigate the potential of water-soluble solvent as an additive to steam for reducing steam-oil ratio (SOR) while keeping SAGD-like rates of bitumen production. The chamber-edge temperature for a given overall composition and operating pressure is defined as the temperature at which the vapor phase completely condenses with decreasing temperature. Thermodynamic predictions show that the chamber-edge temperature so defined will increase substantially if the solvent can partition into the aqueous phase at chamber-edge conditions. This is confirmedin numerical reservoir simulation for coinjection of steam with dimethyl ether (DME), as a water-soluble solvent, for Athabasca bitumen. In simulation case studies, coinjection of steam with DME (DME-SAGD) is compared with SAGD and coinjection of steam with C4 (C4-SAGD), in terms of SOR, bitumen production, local displacement efficiency, and solvent recovery. The steam-injection pressure is 35 bars for all cases, and 2 mol% of solvent is coinjected in solvent-SAGD simulations until the steam chamber reaches the side boundary of a 2-D homogeneous reservoir model. DME is more volatile and less soluble in bitumen than C4 at their corresponding chamber-edge conditions. However, results show that DME-SAGD results in 35% lower SOR than SAGD while being able to increase bitumen-production rates of SAGD. Analysis of simulation results indicates that the solubility of DME in water not only makes the chamber-edge temperature higher than that of C4-SAGD, but also yields15% higher solvent-recovery factor than C4-SAGD. The main reason for the latter observation is that a much smaller fraction of the injected solvent is present in the vapor phase in DME-SAGD than in C4-SAGD. Also, DME dissolves in both water and bitumen, which results in the aqueous and oleic phases of nearly-equal density within the gravity-drainage zone near the edge of a steam chamber. This is the neutral regime of oil-water two-phase flow along the chamber edge between the two extreme cases: SAGD and C4-SAGD. Unlike in C4-SAGD, the reduced gravity segregation in DME-SAGD is expected to facilitate the mixing of condensed solvent with bitumen near the edge of a steam chamber. "

Reliable design of such processes requires reservoir flow simulation based on a proper phase-behavior model so that the oleic-phase viscosity near the steam-chamber edge can be modeled reliably. However, the effect of bitumen characterization (e.g., the number of pseudo components used) on steam-solvent coinjection simulation has not been studied in detail, and can be realized only after running multiple reservoir simulations, which is time consuming. There are two main objectives in this paper. One is to develop a reliable method for bitumen characterization by improving the fluid characterization method that was recently developed based on perturbation from n-alkanes (PnA). The other is to develop a novel analytical method for assessing the sensitivity of a particular coinjection simulation to bitumen characterization without having to perform reservoir simulations. A simulation case study is given to validate this analytical method. A proper number of pseudo components for bitumen characterization cannot be determined without considering the effect of phase behavior on the oleic-phase viscosity at chamber-edge conditions in steam-solvent coinjection simulation. Results show that the analytical method developed in this research can detect the sensitivity of recovery simulation to bitumen characterization without performing multiple flow simulations using different sets of fluid models. The PnA-based method developed for bitumen characterization gives reliable predictions of phase behavior for bitumen/solvent mixtures with a small amount of experimental data. "

                    "abstract": "Compositional simulation of solvent injection requires reliable characterization of reservoir fluids by use of an equation of state (EOS). Under the uncertainty associated with nonidentifiable components, reservoir fluids are conventionally characterized in the absence of universal methodology. This is true even for relatively simple fluids involving only the gaseous (V) and oleic (L1) phases. No systematic method has been presented for characterization of more-complex fluids, exhibiting three hydrocarbon phases: the V, L1, and solvent-rich-liquid (L2) phases. This paper presents a new algorithm for systematic characterization of multiphase behavior for solvent-injection simulation. The reliability of the method comes mainly from the binary-interaction parameters (BIPs) newly developed for the Peng-Robinson (PR) (Peng and Robinson 1976, 1978) EOS to represent three-phase behavior, including upper critical endpoints, for n-alkane and carbon dioxide (CO2)/n-alkane binaries. The regression part in fluid characterization broadly follows the concept of perturbation from n-alkanes, which was successfully applied for simpler two-phase fluids in our prior research. The algorithm, in its simplest form, uses only the saturation pressure and liquid density at a given composition and reservoir temperature. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the reliability of the algorithm for 90 reservoir fluids and their mixtures with solvents. Predictions are compared with experimental data for up to three phases. Results show that the simple algorithm developed in this research enables the PR-EOS to predict multiphase behavior in spite of the limited data used in the regression. Without the use of the BIPs developed in this research, the PR-EOS may fail to predict three phases, or may provide erroneous three-phase predictions. "

In this research, a new solubility model that accounts for the presence of particular ions has been developed using the Gibbs free energy minimization model. The Gibbs free energy function provides the advantage of combining different thermodynamic models - Equation of State (EOS) for hydrocarbon or gas phase components and activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components. The developed model uses Pitzer activity coefficients for aqueous phase components where experimental data available for individual salt mixtures have been used to tune coefficients. We use this solubility model to quantify the impact of particular ions for CO2 sequestration application. We discuss strategies for modifying the brine composition that can increase CO2 solubility and hence, aid CO2 sequestration. "

Its accurate description can lead to more accurate estimation of hydrocarbons in place in shale, as well as better understanding of the mechanisms governing hydrocarbon recovery from shale. This paper presents both experimental and modeling studies of the coupled effects of competitive adsorption, capillary pressure and pore size distribution on the phase behavior of fluid mixtures in partially confined spaces. Experimentally, we measured the pressure/volume (PV) relationships along isothermal temperatures for fluid mixtures (N2/n-C4H10 and CH4/n-C4H10 binaries) that were contained in bulk spaces (PVT cell) and in partially confined spaces, respectively. To make the so-called partially confined space, the PVT cell was connected to a container holding a shale core sample. The partially confined space consists of the pore space in the shale core and the bulk space in the PVT cell. Theoretically, we developed a phase-behavior model for partially confined fluids by considering competitive adsorption, capillary pressure and pore size distribution of the shale core. In this model, the bulk PVT space is considered to be a capillary tube with an infinite diameter, while the shale sample is deemed to comprise of a series of capillary tubes with various diameters. Test results show that, at the same temperature, the bubble point pressure of N2/n-C4H10 mixture in the partially confined space is higher than that in the bulk space, while the bubble point pressure of CH4/n-C4H10 mixture in the partially confined space is smaller than that in the bulk space. When a fluid mixture comes into contact with a shale sample, the individual components in the mixture may be preferentially adsorbed onto the shale sample, leading to the competitive adsorption phenomenon. The competitive adsorption of gas mixture onto shale can change the initial mixture composition, and thus affect the phase behavior of the mixture. The theoretical model can be properly tuned to yield bubble point pressures that are well matching the measured ones. "

This is because the number of equilibrium phases is unknown in temperature and composition space, and because the system of equations in PH flash becomes nearly degenerate for narrow-boiling fluids. The term “narrow-boiling” is used in the literature to refer to enthalpy that is sensitive to temperature. The primary objective of this research is to develop the multiphase PH-flash algorithm integrated with stability analysis that resolves the two technical challenges mentioned above. The secondary objective is to present a new analysis of narrow-boiling behavior by coupling energy and phase behavior equations through the temperature dependency of K values. The thermodynamic model used is the Peng-Robinson EOS with the van der Waals mixing rules. PH flash in this research is formulated by use of the tangent-plane-distance function, in which phase-split computation is integrated with phase-stability analysis. The formulated PH flash is solved by the direct-substitution algorithm with an arbitrary number of sampling compositions (NS), at which phase stability is measured during the iteration. The number of equilibrium phases is not required to be fixed in the new algorithm. Results in case studies show that the new algorithm can robustly handle phase appearance/disappearance with narrow-boiling behavior, including the case of one degree of freedom. The algorithm becomes more robust with increasing NS because the possibility of finding all stationary points of the tangent-plane-distance function increases. However, the number of iterations required tends to increase with increasing NS because the algorithm with more sampling compositions may take more iterations for merging and adding some of the sampling compositions. The general condition presented for narrow-boiling behavior is that the interplay between energy balance and phase behavior is significant. Two subsets of the condition are derived by analyzing the convex function whose gradient vectors consist of the Rachford-Rice equations; (i) the overall composition is near an edge of composition space, and (ii) the solution conditions (temperature, pressure, and overall composition) are near a critical point, including a critical endpoint. A special case of the first specific condition is the fluids with one degree of freedom. These conditions for narrow-boiling behavior are demonstrated in case studies. "

The algorithm developed is based on the direct substitution (DS) presented in our previous research for two phases.

The thermodynamic model used is the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the van der Waals mixing rules. The narrow-boiling behavior in isenthalpic flash occurs when a small temperature change yields significant changes of equilibrium-phase compositions relative to the overall composition. The system of equations used in the DS algorithm becomes degenerate for narrow-boiling fluids.

Oil bypassing by gas occurs at different scales because of micro and macroscopic heterogeneities, gravity segregation, and front instability. Part of the bypassed oil can be recovered by crossflow between the bypassed and flowing regions. This characteristic of reservoir flow is referred to as capacitance flow behavior in the literature. Modeling of such flow behavior at the sub-grid scale is challenging in the conventional flow simulation since fluids are perfectly mixed and in equilibrium within individual grid blocks under the local equilibrium assumption. This research investigates capacitance flow behavior in compositional reservoir simulation. An efficient two-step method is presented to model bypassed oil recovery in multiphase compositional flow simulation of gas floods. The oil bypassing is first quantified by use of the dual-porosity flow with two dimensionless groups; bypassed fraction and throughput ratio. To represent bypassed oil recovery in single-porosity flow, a new flow-based fluid characterization is applied to part of the heavy fractions of the fluid model used. Properties for pseudo components can be determined based on the throughput ratio estimated in the dual-porosity flow. Case studies for various reservoir/fluid properties show that single-porosity flow with the new method reasonably represents bypassed oil recovery observed in core floods and fine-scale heterogeneous simulations.

                    "abstract": "Numerical simulation of enhanced oil recovery processes, such as gas and steam floods, requires that the reservoir fluid of interest is reliably modeled by use of an equation of state (EOS). Reservoir fluid characterization using an EOS can be challenging because of the uncertainties associated with non-identifiable heavy fractions, which are characterized as a few pseudo components. This paper presents a new method for reservoir fluid characterization that directly perturbs the attraction and covolume parameters of pseudo components from the n-alkanes’ values (direct perturbation from n-alkanes, or direct PnA). The direct PnA method systematically adjusts the attraction and covolume parameters of all pseudo components within a given reservoir fluid through a few adjustable parameters. As in our prior research, the ψ(=a/b2) parameter is used to ensure the proper interrelationship between the attraction (a) and covolume (b) parameters. A new approach to adjustment of the ψ parameters is developed with a linear relationship of ψ with molecular weight. The Peng–Robinson (PR) EOS is used throughout the research. The direct PnA method is applied to 84 different reservoir fluids, such as gas condensates, volatile oils, and heavy oils. Characterization of each fluid uses the saturation pressure and liquid density data at different pressures at the reservoir temperature. Other phase behavior data available are used to test the predictive capability of the fluid models developed using the PR EOS with the direct PnA method. Results show that the reservoir fluids tested are reliably characterized by the systematic control over phase behavior predictions in the direct PnA method. Unlike prior characterization methods, the direct PnA method does not require estimation of apparent critical parameters of non-identifiable heavy fractions. "

                    "abstract": "Coinjection of a low concentration of solvent with steam has been studied as an alternative to steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). This research presents a semi-analytical method for comparing oil drainage rates of SAGD and coinjection processes using different single-component solvents for a given set of reservoir/operating conditions. The oil recovery in coinjection involves complex interaction of energy and mass balances with the effects of gravity, phase behavior, and multiphase flow. We simplify the complex interaction without loss of fundamental mechanisms, while retaining the phase behavior details near the chamber edge. The new method begins with solution for thermodynamic conditions at the chamber edge, where the phase transition occurs between two and three phases. Three components are considered; oil, solvent, and water. The chamber-edge conditions that are solved for are used to estimate distributions of solvent and temperature beyond the chamber edge. Darcy’s law and material balance are then applied to derive an analytical expression for oil-drainage ratio, the ratio of oil drainage in coinjection to that in SAGD. Since the chamber-edge temperature and composition are interdependent for this ternary phase behavior problem, oil-drainage ratio is solved for as a function of solvent concentration in the oleic (L) phase at the chamber edge (xsLedge). Case studies with the semi-analytical method show that oil-drainage ratio is higher in the higher xsLedge range than in the lower xsLedge range for a given coinjection solvent. This indicates that efficient oil recovery in coinjection requires high accumulation of solvent at the chamber edge. Oil-drainage ratios calculated for different coinjection solvents are compared in the high xsLedge range for preliminary screening of single-component coinjection solvents. This offers significant time savings in selecting a coinjection solvent by reducing the need for numerical reservoir simulation. The semi-analytical method also indicates that highly volatile solvents, which are relatively less expensive in general, tend to be more effective for less viscous reservoir oil and higher operating pressure. Less volatile solvents may offer more flexibility in operating conditions since they remain effective at lower pressures. These results are validated using fine-scale numerical reservoir simulations.

                    "abstract": "Low-temperature oil displacement by enriched-gas or carbon-dioxide (CO2) can exhibit multiphase flow of three hydrocarbon phases; the oleic (L1), solvent-rich liquid (L2), and gaseous (V) phases. The L2 phase can play a significant role in these oil recovery processes. Recently, oil displacement by three hydrocarbon phases was explained on the basis of interphase mass transfer on phase transitions in multiphase flow. However, systematic investigation into the complex interplay between phase behavior and mobilities has been hindered by issues in multiphase compositional flow simulation, such as incorrect phase identification. This paper presents the effect of relative permeability on oil displacement by three hydrocarbon phases. A new method for robust phase identification is developed and implemented in a 1D convective flow simulator with no volume change on mixing. The new method uses tie triangles and their normal unit vectors tabulated as part of the simulation input information. The extensions of the limiting tie triangles at the upper and lower critical endpoints (UCEP and LCEP) define three different regions in composition space; the super-UCEP, super-LCEP, and sub-CEP regions. The method can properly recognize five different two-phase regions surrounding the three-phase region; the two two-phase regions that are super-CEP, and the three different two-phase regions that originate with the corresponding edges of the three-phase region in the sub-CEP region. Multiphase behavior calculations are conducted rigorously by use of the Peng-Robinson equation of state with the van der Waals mixing rules during the flow simulation. Simulation case studies are presented with a quaternary model and the West Sak oil model with 15 components. Results show that the phase-identification method developed in this research can correctly solve for phase identities in three-hydrocarbon-phase flow simulation. The method can quantify the relative location of the current overall composition to the three-phase region in composition space. Simulation results are analyzed by use of the distance parameters that describe interphase mass transfer on multiphase transitions in oil displacement. In the case study for the West Sak oil displacement, the analysis confirms that the miscibility level of oil displacement increases with increasing methane dilution. The effect of relative permeability diminishes as the miscibility level increases owing to methane dilution. The distance parameters can properly represent the interaction of phase behavior and mobilities since they are derived from mass conservation, not only from thermodynamic conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Thermal compositional simulation can be challenging when narrow-boiling behavior is involved. The term “narrow-boiling” is used in the literature to refer to enthalpy that is sensitive to temperature. This paper presents an analysis of narrow-boiling behavior on the basis of multiphase isenthalpic-flash equations, where energy and phase behavior equations are coupled through the temperature dependency of K values. The Peng-Robinson equation of state is the thermodynamic model used in the analysis. The general condition for narrow-boiling behavior is that the interplay between energy balance and phase behavior is significant. This is realized in engineering computations, such as flash calculations and reservoir simulation, as the sensitivity of K values to temperature. Two subsets of the condition are derived by analyzing the convex function whose gradient vectors consist of the Rachford-Rice equations; (i) the overall composition is near an edge of composition space, and (ii) the solution conditions (temperature, pressure, and overall composition) are near a critical point, including a critical endpoint. A special case of the first specific condition is the fluids with one degree of freedom, for which enthalpy is discontinuous in temperature. Case studies are given to confirm the narrow-boiling conditions for water-containing hydrocarbon mixtures. Narrow-boiling behavior tends to occur in thermal compositional simulation likely because water is by far the most dominant component in the fluid systems formed in the simulation. K values can be sensitive to temperature for those fluids with skewed concentration distributions. Decoupling of temperature from the other variables is confirmed to be robust in isenthalpic flash for narrow-boiling fluids. "

                    "abstract": "Laboratory and field data, although limited in number, have shown that steam/solvent coinjection can lead to a higher oil-production rate, higher ultimate oil recovery, and lower steam/oil ratio,compared with steam-only injection in steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). However, a critical question still remains unanswered: Under what circumstances can the previously mentioned benefits be obtained when steam and solvent are coinjected? To answer this question requires a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms involved in coinjection and an application of this knowledge to numerical simulation. Our earlier studies demonstrated that the determining factors for improved oil-production rates are relative positions with respect to the temperature and solvent fronts, the steam and solvent contents of the chamber at its interface with reservoir bitumen, and solvent-diluting effects on the mobilized bitumen just ahead of the chamber edge. Then, the keymechanisms for improved oil displacement are solvent propagation, solvent accumulation at the chamber edge, and phase transition. This paper deals with this unanswered question by providing some key guidelines for selecting an optimum solvent and its concentration in coinjection of a single-component solvent with steam. The optimization considers the oil-production rate, ultimate oil recovery, and solvent retention in situ. Multiphase behavior of water/hydrocarbon mixtures in the chamber is explained in detail analytically and numerically. The proposed guidelines are applied to simulation of the Senlac solvent-aided-process pilot and the Long Lake expanding-solvent SAGD pilot. Results show that an optimum volatility of solvent can be typically observed in terms of the oil-production rate for given operation conditions. This optimum volatility occurs as a result of the balance between two factors affecting the oil mobility along the chamber edge: reduction of the chamber-edge temperature and superior dilution of oil in coinjection of more-volatile solvent with steam. It is possible to maximize oil recovery and minimize solvent retention in situ by controlling the concentration of a given coinjection solvent. Beginning coinjection immediately after achieving interwell communication enables the enhancement of oil recovery early in the process. Subsequently, the solvent concentration should be gradually decreased until it becomes zero for the final period of the coinjection. Simulation case studies show the validity of the oil-recovery mechanisms described. In the final section of the paper, a limited economic analysis of SAGD and different coinjection cases is provided.

                    "abstract": "Mixtures of reservoir oil and carbon dioxide (CO2) can exhibit complex multiphase behavior at temperatures typically less than 120°F, in which a third CO2-rich liquid (L2) phase can coexist with the oleic (L1) and gaseous (V) phases. The three-phase behavior is bounded by two types of critical endpoints (CEPs) in composition space. The lower CEP (LCEP) is a tie line in which the two liquid phases merge in the presence of the V phase, and the upper CEP (UCEP) is a tie line in which the L2 and V phases merge in the presence of the L1 phase. Slimtube tests reported in the literature show that low-temperature oil displacement by CO2 can result in the high displacement efficiency of more than 90% when three phases are present during the displacement. The nearly piston-like displacements can be quantitatively reproduced in numerical simulations when the CEP behavior is properly considered. However, it is uncertain how multicontact miscibility (MCM) is developed through the interaction of flow and three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior. This research presents a detailed analysis of mass conservation on multiphase transitions between two and three phases for the limiting three-phase flow, where the L1 phase is completely displaced by the L2 phase on the LCEP. The analysis indicates that interphase mass transfer on multiphase transitions occurs in the most-efficient way for MCM development. Simple analytical conditions derived for MCM through three phases are applied to 1D fine-scale simulations of CO2 floods by use of four and more components. Results show that the MCM conditions are nearly satisfied when the effect of numerical dispersion is small. MCM is likely developed through three hydrocarbon phases on the LCEP in the cases studied. This is consistent with analytical solutions of water and gas injection presented in the literature, in which MCM is developed on a CEP for the aqueous, V, and L1 phases. For MCM cases in this research, the L2-V two phases are present upstream of the miscible front if the composition path does not go through the UCEP tie line. However, they also can be miscible on the non-L1 edge of the UCEP tie line if the MCM composition path goes through it. Three-phase flow gradually changes to two-phase flow with varying pressure in the presence of numerical dispersion. It is shown that interphase mass transfer on multiphase transitions becomes less efficient during the change until the three-phase region completely disappears. "

Three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior has been studied in the literature for carbon dioxide (CO2) floods and enriched-gas floods at relatively low temperatures. Prior research on heavy-oil displacement with enriched gas presented that displacement efficiency at a given throughput can be nonmonotonic with respect to gas enrichment. Slimtube experiments for such displacements showed that oil recovery increased first, then decreased, and increased again with increasing gas enrichment. An optimum displacement with a high efficiency of more than 90% was observed when three-hydrocarbon-phase flow was present. However, detailed mechanisms for such an optimum displacement with three phases have not been explained in the literature. In this research, we investigate mass transfer on multiphase transitions between two and three phases for three-hydrocarbon-phase displacements. Simple conditions are derived for the multiphase transitions that yield high local displacement efficiency by three hydrocarbon phases. The derivation is based on the generalized mass conservation for a multiphase transition in 1D gas injection. The conditions derived are applied to explain nonmonotonic oil recovery in quaternary displacements and the West Sak oil displacements. Oil recovery at a given throughput can be nonmonotonic with respect to pressure or gas enrichment. Such a nonmonotonic trend can occur when local oil displacement by three hydrocarbon phases becomes more efficient, but slower, with decreasing pressure or decreasing gas enrichment. An optimum pressure or enrichment can occur as a consequence of the balance between the local displacement efficiency and the propagation rate of three hydrocarbon phases. The West Sak oil displacement with enriched gas studied in this research yields a high displacement efficiency of more than 90% at 1.5 hydrocarbon pore volumes (PV) injected at 53% methane (C1) dilution.

Detailed oil recovery mechanisms near the chamber edge are little known due to the complex interaction of fluid and energy flow, and phase behavior. Prior research on ES-SAGD explains that coinjected solvent can further decrease oil viscosity near the chamber edge by dilution, in conjunction with heat. In this paper, we conduct a detailed investigation on oil displacement mechanisms and the placement of solvent near the chamber edge using fine-scale reservoir simulation. The importance of properly considering both phase behavior and flow to design ES-SAGD is demonstrated. Results show that ES-SAGD can achieve a higher displacement efficiency than SAGD. Oil production rate in ES-SAGD can be two times higher than that in SAGD. As a result, the ultimate oil recovery of ES-SAGD is enhanced by almost 20%, compared to SAGD in this research. The oil saturation reduction results from condensed solvent bank and phase transition near the chamber edge. The condensed solvent bank lowers the oil-component concentrations there. The diluted oil with solvent is then redistributed in the gaseous and oleic phases in the presence of the water phase on the phase transition at the chamber edge.

                    "abstract": "Mixtures of reservoir oil and CO2 can exhibit complex multiphase behavior at temperatures typically below 120°F, where a third CO2-rich liquid (L2) phase can coexist with the oleic (L1) and gaseous (V) phases.  The three-phase behavior is bounded by two types of critical endpoint (CEP) tie lines in composition space.  The lower CEP (LCEP) tie line is where the two liquid phases merge in the presence of the V phase, and the upper CEP (UCEP) tie line is where the L2 and V phases merge in the presence of the L1 phase.  Slim-tube tests reported in the literature show that low-temperature oil displacement by CO2 can result in high displacement efficiency of more than 90% when three phases are present during the displacement.  The nearly piston-like displacements can be quantitatively reproduced in numerical simulations when the CEP behavior is properly considered.  However, it is uncertain how multicontact miscibility (MCM) is developed through interaction of flow and three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior. In this research, we analyze mass conservation on multiphase transition between two and three phases for the limiting three-phase flow, where the L1 phase is completely displaced by the L2 phase on the LCEP.  The analysis indicates that mass transfer on multiphase transition occurs in the most efficient way for MCM development.  Simple analytical conditions derived for MCM through three phases are applied to 1-D fine-scale simulations of CO2 floods using four and more components.  Results show that the MCM conditions are nearly satisfied when the effect of numerical dispersion is small.  MCM is likely developed through three hydrocarbon phases on the LCEP in the cases studied.  This is consistent with analytical solutions of water and gas injection presented in the literature, where MCM is developed on a CEP for the aqueous, V, and L1 phases.  For MCM cases in this research, the L2-V two phases are present upstream of the miscible front, but can also be miscible on the non-L1 edge of the UCEP tie line. The limiting three-phase flow does not necessarily occur at the highest pressure for three-phase flow, especially when a heavy oil is displaced by solvent at low temperatures.  This is a marked difference from the conventional MCM development through two phases, where the limiting two-phase flow typically occurs at the highest pressure for two-phase flow. Three-phase flow gradually changes to two-phase flow with varying pressure in the presence of numerical dispersion.  We show that mass transfer on multiphase transition becomes less efficient during the change until the three-phase region completely disappear.

                    "abstract": "The conventional reservoir simulation uses the local equilibrium assumption, where fluids are completely mixed and at equilibrium within individual gridblocks.  This assumption allows for no bypassing of oil at the sub-grid scale in gas injection simulation.  Oil bypassing by gas, however, always occurs due to micro and macroscopic heterogeneities, gravity, and front instability. There are a few methods proposed in the literature that attempt to model the effects of sub-grid heterogeneity in gas injection simulation.  The concept of miscible residual oil saturation (i.e., the Sorm method) excludes the immobile oil from flash calculations and explicitly models bypassed oil.  However, the Sorm method cannot model bypassed oil recovery because it allows for no mass flux between the bypassed and flowing fractions.  The alpha-factor method uses transport coefficients to adjust components' flux in compositional simulation.  It has been used to retain a desired amount of residual oil in history matching for predominantly single-phase flow.  However, its applicability to partial miscibility conditions is not fully understood.  This is likely because the presence of more phases with partial miscibility yields more non-linearity and severer non-uniqueness in the history matching process. In this research, we develop an efficient method to model bypassed oil recovery in multiphase compositional simulation.  Oil bypassing in gas injection simulation is first explained using dual-porosity-flow (DPF) models.  We show that DPF can capture the characteristics of the dispersion-capacitance model, where oil held up in the bypassed fraction gradually migrates to the flowing fraction through intra-block mass flux.  Fluid flow in the presence of capacitance is characterized using the DPF parameters; the bypassed fraction, throughput ratio (RT), and Peclet number. A new fluid characterization method is then used to efficiently reproduce DPF characteristics using a single-porosity-flow (SPF) model.  An EOS fluid model is corrected for capacitance by adding heavier oil components that are characterized depending on RT.  A case study demonstrates successful application of the new method to reflect capacitance effects observed in corefloods in field-scale gas injection simulation.  Prediction of residual oil distribution within a reservoir depends significantly on how bypassed oil is modeled in the simulation.  Unlike the alpha-factor method, our method requires no changes in the governing equations and in relative permeabilities.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Mixtures of oil with solvent gas can exhibit three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior at reservoir conditions, where the solvent-rich liquid (L2) phase coexists with the gaseous (V) and oleic (L1) phases. Three-hydrocarbon-phase behavior has been studied in the literature for CO2 floods and enriched gas floods at relatively low temperatures. Prior research on heavy-oil displacement with enriched gas presented that displacement efficiency at a given throughput can be non-monotonic with respect to gas enrichment. Slim-tube experiments for such displacements showed that oil recovery increased first, then decreased, and increased again with increasing gas enrichment. An optimum displacement with a high efficiency of more than 90% was observed when three-hydrocarbon-phase flow was present. However, detailed mechanisms for such an optimum displacement with three phases have not been explained in the literature. In this research, we investigate mass transfer on multiphase transitions between two and three phases for three-hydrocarbon-phase displacements. Simple conditions are derived for the multiphase transitions that yield high local displacement efficiency by three hydrocarbon phases. The derivation is based on the generalized jump conditions for a multiphase transition shock from analytical theory of one-dimensional gas injection. The conditions derived are applied to explain non-monotonic oil recovery in quaternary displacements and the West Sak oil displacements. Oil recovery at a given throughput can be non-monotonic with respect to pressure or gas enrichment. Such a non-monotonic trend can occur when local oil displacement by three hydrocarbon phases becomes more efficient, but slower, with decreasing pressure or decreasing gas enrichment. An optimum pressure or enrichment can occur as a consequence of the balance between the local displacement efficiency and the propagation rate of three hydrocarbon phases. The West Sak oil displacement with enriched gas studied in this research yields a high displacement efficiency of more than 90% at 1.5 hydrocarbon-pore-volumes injected at 53% methane dilution. Introduction Solvent injection is a widely used method for enhanced oil recovery (Lake 1989; Taber et al. 1997; Orr 2007). Its implementation has been made for a wide variety of oil reservoirs; e.g., in West Texas (Mizenko 1992; Tanner et al. 1992; Stein et al. 1992), in Alaska (McGuire et al. 2001), in Canada (Malik and Islam 2000), and in the North Sea (Varotsis et al. 1986). Coinjection of steam and solvent could further widen the applicability of solvent to extra-heavy oil and bitumen reservoirs. A few pilot tests for the coinjection were reported in the literature (Gupta et al. 2005; Gupta and Gittins 2006; Dickson et al. 2011). Reliable design of solvent injection requires detailed understanding of oil displacement mechanisms. Displacement theory for solvent injection has been established for conventional two hydrocarbon phases (Orr 2007). Multicontact miscibility (MCM) between two phases can be developed through vaporizing, or condensing, or combined condensing/vaporizing mechanisms (Johns 1992; Dindoruk 1992). An important design parameter for solvent injection is the thermodynamic minimum miscibility pressure (MMP). The thermodynamic MMP is the minimum displacement pressure at which complete miscibility is developed along a composition path from the injection gas composition to the reservoir oil composition for one dimensional (1-D) flow in the absence of dispersion. Efficient methods have been developed for MMP calculation, where phase behavior and flow are effectively decoupled (e.g., Johns and Orr 1996; Ahmadi and Johns 2011). "

When applied to heavy hydrocarbons and their mixtures, however, the PR EOS can exhibit erroneous phase behavior predictions. In this research, we develop new correlations for critical temperatures (TC), critical pressures (PC), and acentric factors (ω) that enable the PR EOS to accurately predict phase behavior of n-alkanes up to C100. Predictions using the PR EOS with the new correlations give 3.0% average absolute deviation (AAD) for 3583 density data, and 3.4% AAD for 1525 vapor pressure data for n-alkanes from C7 to C100. Significant improvement is also observed for bubble point pressure and density predictions for n-alkane mixtures. The new correlations developed for TC, PC, and ω are then applied for characterizing 25 different reservoir oils. Results show that, compared to the conventional critical parameter correlations in the literature, our correlations give more accurate phase behavior predictions while requiring less adjustment of the parameters. The optimum TC and PC developed for n-alkanes can serve as useful lower limits for TC and PC of pseudo components of reservoir oils that are characterized using the PR EOS. "

                    "abstract": "Reliable design of solvent injection for enhanced heavy-oil recovery requires accurate representation of multiphase behavior for heavy-oil/solvent mixtures in a wide range of pressure-temperature-composition conditions.  Characterization of a heavy oil is more difficult than that of a conventional oil because the former is conducted under more uncertainties in composition and PVT data.  Volume-shift parameters are often required to improve density predictions, separately from compositional behavior predictions, in conventional fluid characterization methods (CM).  Thermodynamically, however, volumetric behavior predictions (e.g., densities) are consequences of compositional behavior predictions. In this paper, we develop a new fluid characterization method (NM) that gives accurate multiphase behavior representation for heavy-oil/solvent mixtures without using volume-shift parameters.  The Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS is used with the van der Waals mixing rules.  In the NM, pseudo components are initially assigned critical temperature (TC), critical pressure (PC), and acentric factor (?) values that are optimized for the PR EOS for accurate phase behavior predictions for n-alkanes from C7 to C100.  The subsequent regression process searches for an optimum set of TC, PC, and ? in physically justified directions.  The regression algorithm developed does not require user's experience of thermodynamic modeling for robust convergence.  The NM also satisfies Pitzer's definition of ? for each component. The NM is compared with the CM in terms of various types of phase diagrams, minimum miscibility pressure calculations, and 1-D oil displacement simulations.  Twenty two different reservoir oils are used in the comparisons.  Results show that the NM with 11 components gives phase behavior predictions that are nearly identical to those using the CM with 30 components.  A 1-D simulation case study presents that the NM can robustly reduce dimensionality of composition space while keeping accurate multiphase behavior predictions along composition paths at different dispersion levels tested.  We show that the CM with volume shift can give erroneous phase behavior and oil recovery predictions in compositional simulation.  The NM does not require volume shift to achieve accurate predictions of compositional and volumetric phase behaviors.  The two types of phase behaviors are properly coupled in the NM.  Introduction Solvent methods for enhanced heavy-oil recovery have been studied and implemented in oil fields (e.g., Mohanty et al. 1995; DeRuiter et al. 1994).  Various steam/solvent coinjection schemes are also proposed in the literature to improve efficiency of the conventional steam-assisted gravity drainage (e.g., Hornbrook et al. 1991; Nasr et al. 2003; Gupta et al. 2003; Li et al. 2011; Gates and Chakrabarty 2008).  Reliable design of such oil recovery processes requires compositional simulation to model mass transfer among phases using a cubic equation of state (EOS). Cubic EOSs are widely used in the petroleum industry to model volumetric and compositional phase behavior of conventional oils.  The most widely used cubic EOSs are the Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS (Peng and Robinson 1976, 1978) and the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS (Soave 1972).  These EOSs together with the van der Waals mixing rules are suitable for computationally efficient representation of vapor-liquid equilibria for hydrocarbon mixtures at a wide range of pressures (Okuno et al. 2010).

Results of slim-tube measurements in the literature show that an oil displacement by CO2 can achieve high displacement efficiency of more than 90% when three hydrocarbon phases coexist during the displacement. However, the mechanism for the high-displacement efficiency is uncertain because the complex interaction of phase behavior with flow during the displacement is not fully understood. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of three-phase behavior predictions and displacement efficiency for low-temperature CO2 floods. Four-component EOS models are initially used to investigate systematically the effects of pressure, temperature, and oil properties on development of three-phase regions and displacement efficiency. Multicomponent oil displacements by CO2 are then considered. We use a compositional reservoir simulator capable of robust three-phase equilibrium calculations. Results show that high displacement efficiency of low-temperature CO2 floods is a consequence of both condensing and vaporizing behavior. The L2 phase serves as a buffer between the immiscible V and L1 phases within the three-phase region. Components in the L1 phase first transfer efficiently to the L2 phase near a lower critical endpoint (LCEP). These oil components then transfer to the V phase near an upper critical endpoint (UCEP) at the trailing edge of the three-phase region. The CEPs are defined where two of the three coexisting phases merge in the presence of the other immiscible phase. Unlike two-phase displacements, condensation and vaporization of intermediate components occur simultaneously within the three-phase region. The simultaneous condensing/vaporizing behavior involving the CEPs is also confirmed for simulations of several west Texas oil displacements. Quaternary fluid models can predict qualitatively the complex displacements because four is the minimum number of components to develop CEP behavior in composition space at a fixed temperature and pressure.

We first demonstrate the importance of using three-phase flash calculations in compositional simulation by investigating difficulties with two-phase equilibrium approximations proposed in the literature. We then extend an algorithm for reduced two-phase flash calculations to three-phase calculations and show the efficiency and robustness of our algorithm. The reduced three-phase flash algorithm is implemented in a multiphase compositional simulator to demonstrate the speed-up and increased robustness of simulations in various case studies. Results show that use of a two-phase equilibrium approximation in reservoir simulation can result in a complete failure or erroneous simulation results. Simulation case studies show that our reduced method can decrease computational time significantly without loss of accuracy. Computational time is reduced using our reduced method because of the smaller number of equations to be solved and increased timestep sizes.

Because of its complexity many simulators do not even attempt to incorporate three or more hydrocarbon phases even though such cases are important in many low-temperature gas floods, or for high temperatures where hydrocarbons can partition into water. Multiphase flash algorithms typically use successive substitution (SS) followed by Newton's method. For NP-phase flash calculations, (NP-1) Rachford-Rice (RR) equations are solved in every iteration step in SS, and depending on the choice of independent variables, in Newton's method. Solution of RR equations determines both compositions and amounts of phases for a fixed overall composition and set of K -values. A robust algorithm for RR is critical to obtain convergence in multiphase compositional simulation, and has not been satisfactorily developed unlike the traditional two-phase flash. In this paper, we develop an algorithm for RR equations for multiphase compositional simulation that is guaranteed to converge to the correct solution independent of the number of phases for both positive and negative flash calculations.  We derive a function, whose gradient vector consists of RR equations. This correct solution to the RR equations is formulated as a minimization of the non-monotonic convex function using the independent variables of (NP-1) phase mole fractions. The key to obtaining a robust algorithm is that we specify non-negative constraints for the resulting equilibrium phase compositions, which are described by a very small region with no poles. The minimization uses Newton's direction with a line search technique to exhibit super-linear convergence. We show a case in which a previously developed method cannot converge while our algorithm rapidly converges in a few iterations. We implement the algorithm both in a stand-alone flash code and in UTCOMP, a multiphase compositional simulator, and show that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge when a multiphase region exists as indicated by stability analysis.

At the Crystal Geyser and Salt Wash field sites near Green River, Utah, sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation and Mancos Shale have undergone chemical alteration associated with flow of CO2-bearing water under natural conditions over geologic time scales of 103–105 yrs. To quantify the effects of these diagenetic changes on rock fracture mechanical properties we conducted opening-mode fracture mechanics tests using the double torsion method on a suite of CO2-altered and unaltered siliciclastic samples. We show that dissolution of hematite and carbonate cement in Entrada Sandstone by CO2-rich brine lowers fracture toughness by nearly 40% relative to adjacent, unaltered samples from the same unit. In contrast, precipitation of calcite pore cement in a sandstone of the Salt Wash Member of the Morrison Formation, attributed to CO2 degassing during upward fluid flow along the Little Grand Wash Fault, results in a 100–700% increase in fracture toughness. Similarly, precipitation of carbonate mineral cements and replacement of matrix measurably strengthens Mancos Shale, considered a regional top seal. Subcritical fracture growth index (SCI) which quantifies reaction-assisted subcritical fracture propagation is also affected by CO2-related alteration. Based on previous numerical simulations of fracture network growth with varying fracture mechanical parameters, we find that the measured variations in fracture mechanical properties qualitatively match observed differences in opening-mode fracture distributions along the fault, with short, non-connected fractures in CO2-bleached rock, long, throughgoing fractures in calcite-cemented shale, and short, closely spaced, interconnected fracture networks in highly altered rock directly adjacent to fault conduits. Our fracture mechanics tests demonstrate that fracture mechanical properties of reservoir and seal rock can change as a result of chemical CO2–brine–rock interaction. These chemical interactions may favor or inhibit subcritical fracture growth processes and thus reservoir and seal flow properties. In regions of CO2-related mineral dissolution, subcritical fracture growth may reduce seal integrity over time scales beyond those of active injection and reservoir monitoring, thus negatively affecting seal integrity over the expected design lifetime of a CO2 reservoir.

One reason for the complexity is the deformation along weak planes such as faults and cemented natural fractures. The interaction of cemented natural fractures with hydraulic fractures generated as part of reservoir stimulation may impede or terminate hydraulic fracture propagation, which depends on several factors such as interfacial bond strength between the cemented natural fractures and the reservoir rock. Most previous studies treat natural fractures as interfaces without considering their thickness. In this study, the semi−circular bend (SCB) tests for specimens with heterogeneity are used to study the fracture−fracture interactions, because the tensile fracture in the SCB test is analogous to the induced hydraulic fracture. With simple experimental setup and good repeatability, the SCB test results provide insights into real hydraulic fracture propagation behavior in naturally fractured reservoirs. We analyze the effects of natural fracture thickness and rock−cement interfacial bond strength, which are not commonly considered. Results show that hydraulic fracture crossing/diverting behavior depends on the approach angle, the rock−cement interfacial bond strength, and the thickness of natural fracture. Results also imply that as hydraulic fractures approach cemented natural fractures, the hydraulic fracture near‒tip stress state is influenced by the tensile and shear strength of the rock−cement interface. In the SCB test, the sample geometry induces shearing along the cemented natural fracture−rock interface, analogous to a frictionally slipping interface in the subsurface. Depending on the frictional strength and the approach angle, the interface may crack apart, and attract a propagating fracture. "

As the stiffness of the vein increased, the microcrack-related damage increased and the bond breakages extended longer to either side of the main fracture path. Samples with thicker veins and increasing penetration length showed a weaker vein response; the induced fracture propagated for a longer distance in veins before kinking back into the rock matrix. In addition, the numerical model confirmed that the opening mode fracture initiated from the notch tip and the intergranular bond failure created microcracks within the vein before the approaching fracture intersected the vein. The failure mode of the bonds between discrete elements in the vein was predominantly tensile mode rather than shear. "

Moreover, the magnitude of stress anisotropy can control the results of hydraulic fracture crossing or diverting into the vein. To study the effect of vein properties and the differential stress on the interaction of hydraulic fractures with mineral-filled veins, we employed a three-dimensional (3D) Discrete Element Method (DEM) model which couples the fluid flow and the bonded-particle assembly. The hydraulic fracture interaction with the vein was investigated by monitoring the bond breakages and measuring the fracture diversion distance along the vein before kinking back into the rock matrix. Numerical results are in good agreement with the fracture diversion results from the published experimental and numerical SCB tests of Marcellus shale with calcite-filled veins. The propagating hydraulic fracture is more likely to divert into the veins with smaller approach angle. Increasing the differential stress leads to fracture crossing than diversion into the vein. For veins with greater stiffness than the host rock, microcracks were generated in the vein before the hydraulic fracture intersected it. For tight formations with stiffer veins, the vein permeability did not have much influence on the fracture diversion result since the damage induced by the stress concentration ahead of the hydraulic fracture tip dominated the fluid flow in the vein.

                    "abstract": "Real-time analysis of drilling mud loss data is an effective tool to characterize the size, distribution and permeability of natural fractures. The estimated properties of natural fractures can then be used to modify the drilling fluid properties and design remedial mud loss treatment to stop further drilling fluid loss. Moreover, characterization of natural fracture provides crucial information for the design and application of reservoir stimulation operations. In this paper, we present a theoretical model to simulate the invasion of the drilling fluid into natural fractures. Mathematical modelling was performed for two types of rheology constitutive models which are commonly used for drilling fluids, namely Bingham Plastic and Herschel-Bulkley. The fluid leak-off into the formation is modelled using Carter's model. Moreover, a simplified local elasticity equation is used for the fracture width variation due to fluid pressure. A forward finite-difference numerical scheme is used to solve the pressure drop equation. The developed model is then validated against well-known analytical solutions and numerical simulations. Parametric studies were conducted to evaluate the impact of the fracture deformability, formation leak-off properties, drilling fluid rheology, and the pore fluid contribution. Finally, the output of the developed model is compared with the field data of a welldocumented mud loss incident. The obtained results indicate that the incorporating the effect of the fluid leak-off may significantly increase the rate of mud loss volume. Therefore, for highly permeable formations (such as carbonates), considering the impact of the fluid leak-off effect seems necessary for a realistic characterization of the mud loss problem. Fracture deformability affects the mud loss volume, with higher deformability leading to a larger mud loss volume. Also, the numerical results confirmed that the rate and magnitude of mud loss volume is significantly affected by the rheological properties of the drilling fluid, in particular the yield stress. In contrast, the effect of pore fluid seems relatively negligible for typical formation fluid types. Comparing the results of our simulation with mud loss field data shows that the developed model can accurately predict the rate and total volume of mud loss into the fractures. Moreover, it shows that incorporating the impact of the fluid leak-off and the fracture stiffness may significantly affect the fracture width prediction. Therefore, these factors should be considered to obtain an accurate estimate of the natural fracture aperture. "

The effect of fluid leak-off into the formation matrix is incorporated using Carter’s model. Various injection profiles from wellbore to natural fracture are accounted for by modeling both radial and linear flow for fluid invasion within the fractures. A finite difference scheme is employed to predict the invasion of the drilling fluid into the fracture. The results of the numerical solution were validated using well-known analytical solution for the mud invasion problem. Several parametric studies were conducted to demonstrate the effect of fluid leak-off and fracture width on the fluid invasion depth and mud loss volume for both radial and linear flow cases. The obtained results indicate that the fluid leak-off reduces the rate of fluid invasion within the fracture. However, it does not affect the maximum depth of the fluid invasion over long time periods. It is shown that the mud loss volume may be significantly varied using different flow types (radial or linear) and leak-off coefficients. The results of the theoretical model are also compared - and found to be in excellent agreement - with the field data of a drilling mud loss incident. It is shown that consideration of fluid leak-off effect can significantly improve the accuracy of the mud loss prediction, and thereby results in a more realistic characterization of naturally fractured reservoirs. 1. INTRODUCTION Accurate characterization of natural fractures is of crucial importance for well construction and reservoir stimulation. A reliable estimate of the natural fracture size is essential for the design of remedial mud loss treatments (Razavi et al., 2015, 2016, and 2017). Also, the knowledge of pre-existing natural fracture properties can significantly improve the application of hydraulic fracturing treatments and enhance the overall productivity of the reservoir (Olson et al., 2009, Bahorich et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2015 and 2016).

                    "abstract": "With the development of shale gas reservoirs, various fracture-propagation models have been developed to predict hydraulic-fracture geometry by considering the stress-shadow effects. Also, many researchers have been working on the development of various production/simulation approaches to simulate production from the complex fracture geometries. The objective of this study is to combine the fracture-propagation modeling and reservoir simulation to optimize production in shale gas reservoirs. First, we have developed a semianalytical model to simulate shale gas production from the nonplanar-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. The important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption are considered. Second, we have developed a fracture-propagation model to predict the nonplanar-fracture geometry by fully coupling elastic deformation of the rock and fluid flow. In this study, the effect of varying number of perforation clusters within a given stage ranging from two to six on the fracture propagation was investigated. Three values of stage spacing were considered including 100, 200, and 300 ft. After predicting the nonplanar-fracture geometry, the semianalytical model is used to simulate production from such fracture geometries. The effects of the number of clusters per stage for varying stage spacing on well productivity were examined. In addition, we compared the well performance with varying stage spacings of 100, 200, and 300 ft under a given lateral length of 2,500 ft. Furthermore, we coupled the fracture-propagation and semianalytical models to analyze a field well performance in a shale gas reservoir. Through the field-case study, a nonplanar-fracture geometry with a good history match was quantified. Also, the difference between the nonplanar-fracture geometry and the converted equivalent planar-fracture geometry with equal fracture length was examined. Finally, the optimal fracture-treatment design for the field well development was recommended. This work can provide new insights into optimization of the number of perforation clusters per stage within a given fracture stage in shale gas reservoirs. "

Accurate characterization of fracture complexity plays an important role in optimizing fracturing design, especially for shale reservoirs with high-density NFs. In this study, we simulated simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation within a single fracturing stage by use of a complex HF-development model. The model was developed to simulate complex fracture propagation by coupling rock mechanics and fluid mechanics. A simplified 3D displacement-discontinuity method (DDM) was implemented to more accurately calculate fracture displacements and fracture-induced dynamic-stress changes than our previously developed pseudo-3D model. The effects of perforation-cluster spacing, differential stress (SHmax–Shmin), and the geometry of various NF patterns on injection pressure and fracture complexity were investigated. The single-stage simulation results show that (1) higher differential stress suppresses fracture length and increases injection pressure; (2) there is an optimal choice for the number of fractures per stage to maximize effective fracture-surface contact area, beyond which increasing the number of fractures actually decreases effective fracture area; and (3) fracture complexity is a function of NF patterns (various regular-pattern geometries were investigated). NFs with small relative angle to HFs are more likely to control the fracture-propagation path. Also, NF patterns with more long fractures tend to increase the likelihood to dominate the preferential fracture trend of fracture trajectory. Our numerical model can provide a physics-based complex fracture network that can be imported into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis. The overall sensitivity results presented should serve as guidelines for fracture-complexity analysis. "

                    "abstract": "The presence of preexisting fractures and the need to place multiple hydraulic fractures in relatively close proximity from each other make stimulating unconventional formations a challenge. This paper experimentally reviews the geomechanical factors governing the hydraulic fracture interactions with the formation's preexisting fractures and the fracturing completion's simultaneous hydraulic fractures. The methodology followed in this study uses a series of laboratory fracturing tests. The experimental tests used rock samples made of synthetic, gypsum-based cements, such as hydrostone and plaster, and were performed in a number of experimental settings to investigate some geomechanical factors of relevance. Among such factors, the preexisting fracture's cementation, aperture, and relative height as well as the design of the fracturing stage completion were examined in the course of the experimental portion of the work. As a result of the laboratory experiments, it has been found that a hydraulic fracture crossing the preexisting fracture is largely dictated by the preexisting fracture's cement fill type relative to the matrix of the host rock. Likewise, the height of the hydraulic fracture relative to the preexisting fracture may govern their intersection mode, however, there seems to be an insignificant impact of the preexisting fracture aperture on the intersection outcome. Moreover, the fracturing stage completion design was found to have considerable impact on the hydraulic fracturing outcome. Stress interference between the fracturing sources in a stage highly affects the outcome of each fracturing source. Middle fracturing sources tend to result in inhibited hydraulic fracture propagations while outer fracturing sources achieve hydraulic fracture propagations with outward curvatures. Overall, the experimental data and findings enable us to validate some theories, calibrate numerical simulators, and answer some pressing questions. The results discussed in this paper provide very useful insights into fracturing unconventional formations. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs requires drilling and hydraulic fracturing within a layered reservoir, which is usually stratified with a variety of stiff and soft layers. The overall strength of layered rocks is useful for predicting their stability or failure under production conditions, which may contribute to vertical height containment of hydraulic fractures in an unconventional reservoir. In this work, triaxial experimental testing of reservoir-analog materials and three-dimensional Particle Flow Code (PFC3D) simulations were used to evaluate the contributions of layer properties, such as number, thickness, and sequence, on the average strength of a layered reservoir. The laboratory and PFC simulation results show that the stiffness and strength of a layered sequence are not affected by factors such as bedding plane strength, the number of layers, or layer thickness. However its stiffness and strength can be related to the relative proportions of stiff and soft layers. The stiffness of the layered sequences obtained from the experiments and PFC models are closely predicted by a calculated harmonic average stiffness of the sequence. The stiffness-strength relation obtained from the reservoir-analog materials has a similar form to those in the literature that were obtained from natural rock types, supporting the utility of PFC models of layered sequences. These results support the use of harmonic average and PFC simulations in estimating elastic stiffness and strength in layered and unconventional reservoir sequences. Introduction Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs generally requires hydraulic fracturing within a layered reservoir, which is usually stratified with layers of different mechanical properties. For instance, Eagle Ford shale is a well laminated reservoir with alternating stiff carbonate rich layers and soft clay rich layers [1]. In order to produce hydrocarbon from unconventional reservoirs more efficiently and economically, a better understanding of hydraulic fracture propagation in layered reservoirs is needed. Among all the issues, vertical height growth of hydraulic fractures is recognized as one of the critical factors to the success of hydraulic fracturing treatments [2, 3]. If the expected hydraulic height growth is not achieved, a large area of payzone will not be stimulated which affects the production. In contrast, if hydraulic fractures grow into the adjacent rock layers which are not productive, an excessive amount of injection fluid and proppants will be wasted [4]. "

                    "abstract": "Simultaneous multiple-fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional resources in shale reservoirs. One challenge to efficiently use the technique is the generation of effective hydraulic fractures from all perforation clusters. In this work, we conducted a fundamental study of physical mechanisms controlling simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation and discussed the potential approaches to improve nonuniform development of multiple fractures. This study was investigated by our recently developed 3D fracture-propagation model that captures the coupled elastic deformation of the rock with fluid flow in the horizontal wellbore and within the fractures. The model demonstrated that fracture geometry was controlled by both the stress-shadow effects and dynamic partitioning of flow rate. The analysis results indicated that the nonuniform development of a multiple-fracture array, for example, a three-fracture array in this study, was induced by the uneven partitioning of flow rate into each fracture, which was dependent on the flow resistance from wellbore friction, perforation friction, and fracture propagation. Furthermore, the stress shadowing from the exterior fractures exerted additional stress on the interior fractures and increased the resistance of fracture propagation, resulting in the interior fractures receiving much less fluid. To minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing and favor more-uniform fracture growth, we investigated potential approaches to promote uniform partitioning of flow rate through adjusting the flow resistance between multiple fractures. The results showed that adjusting perforation friction can provide an effective way to modify the partitioning of flow rate and mitigate the negative effects of stress shadowing. The mechanisms investigated in this study are consistent with field observations. Our approach can help field operators to improve the effectiveness of multiple fracturing treatments and maximize the production. "

                    "abstract": "Multistage hydraulic fracturing, together with horizontal drilling, plays an important role in the economic development of unconventional reservoirs. However, according to field analysis of stimulation effectiveness, only a small percentage of perforation clusters contribute to most of the well production. One reason for this low effectiveness is that multiple fractures do not take the same amount of fluid and proppant because of the interaction between hydraulic fractures (i.e., stress-shadow effects). Unfortunately, how best to minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing is still not fully understood in the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyze this problem to promote more-uniform fracture growth by use of a complex hydraulic-fracture-development model. We use our fracture-propagation model, which couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. The model assumes homogeneous linear-elastic rock medium and does not consider proppant transport in multiple fractures. Partitioning of flow rate between multiple fractures is calculated by use of the principles of flow through an electric-circuit network. Fracture development is dominated by flow-rate distribution, which is controlled by flow resistance within the fractures. For simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation, nonuniform flow-rate distribution is induced because stress-shadow effects exert additional flow resistance on the interior fractures. To balance the extra resistance introduced by the effects, we investigated two adjustment approaches to promote uniform fracture development. The first approach was to adjust perforation number or diameter to increase flow resistance entering the exterior fractures. The second was to mitigate stress-shadow effects through management of nonuniform fracture spacing. We found that decreasing perforation diameter or the number of exterior fractures can divert fluid into the interior fractures and promote even fracture growth. Stress-shadow effects can be mitigated by moving the two interior fractures away from each other and toward the exterior fractures. The key mechanism is to maintain even flow resistance within each fracture and facilitate fractures to obtain the same amount of injection fluid. Furthermore, flow resistance is affected by near-wellbore fracture tortuosity, natural fractures, and stress heterogeneity in the reservoirs. These factors might also be effectively controlled by adding extra flow resistance to pass perforations, provided that this extra resistance is larger than the extra resistance introduced by the factors. This work analyzes the problem of uneven development of multiple fractures along the horizontal wellbore and provides new insights into how to control simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation. It offers potential approaches for engineers to apply in the field to optimize hydraulic-fracturing-treatment design, thereby maximizing well production cost-effectively. "

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe efforts to create a computationally efficient model that is accurate for multiple, three dimensional fracture problems. The accuracy of a fast pseudo-3D method (Olson, 2004) for describing fracture interaction is investigated through comparing with a fully 3D displacement discontinuity method (DDM). Results demonstrate that the pseudo- 3D solution underestimates the mechanical interaction between nearby fractures. The apertures of both interior and exterior fractures given by the pseudo-3D method are larger than the fully 3D solutions. However, 3D DDM is computationally far more expensive than the pseudo-3D method because a) more elements are required to describe a fracture in three dimensions and b) the computational cost per element is higher in 3D. We show that using 1 element in the fracture height direction with the standard 3D equations is unacceptably inaccurate, but by employing an analytically based correction factor, that accuracy can be significantly improved, eliminating the need for extra elements for height-contained hydraulic fracture problems. The higher per element computation cost in 3D is largely the result of the fact that the 3D displacement discontinuity method has three unknowns (opening, strike-slip shear and dip-slip shear). Further speed advantage is gained by dictating all fractures must be vertical, which allows elimination of equation components related to the dip-slip shear. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to problems of multiple hydraulic fracture propagation in horizontal wells. 1. INTRODUCTION In recent years, production of tight oil and shale gas has increased exponentially in the United States. Multiple fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional reservoirs. A better understanding of multiple fracture growth is essential for accurately predicting fracture geometry. Mechanical interaction between multiple fractures, also referred to as stress shadow effects, is a critical factor controlling fracture geometry and inducing complex fracture geometry. To better model fracture interaction, an efficient and accuracy method is required. "

Uncertainties in geology and limited availability of injection data were two of the main challenges that were encountered during the course of the research. Simulation results show some spatial and temporal correlation between the pore pressure change and earthquakes occurrence. There are also areas of substantial predicted pore pressure increase where no seismicity is detected. The results suggest that proper assessment of seismic risk requires good subsurface geology (flow characteristics and pre-existing fault geometry) as well as well injection rate and pressure data. p> 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION One of the very first studies on induced seismicity due to fluid injection was performed on the Denver earthquakes which occurred in the 1960’s due to injection into a disposal well at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) [1]. Injection into the well at the RMA occurred between from 1962 to 1966 with a variable injection rate at different times during the injection periods [1, 2]. It was observed that seismic events continued to occur even after fluid injection was stopped [1, 2]. A few years following the event, an experiment conducted in Rangely, Colorado concluded that fluid injection can be used to control seismic events [3]. Since the 1960s, the link between earthquake clusters and disposal wells has been extensively examined [4]. Research has been done to correlate the various parameters, such as injection pressure and reservoir transmissivity, to the occurrence of induced earthquakes [1-4]. Yet, even though the mechanics behind induced earthquake is established, risk assessment and prediction is still difficult [1-4]. "

                    "abstract": "Successfully creating multiple hydraulic fractures in horizontal wells is critical for unconventional gas production economically. Optimizing the stimulation of these wells will require models that can account for the simultaneous propagation of multiple, potentially nonplanar fractures. In this paper, a novel fracture-propagation model (FPM) is described that can simulate multiple-hydraulic-fracture propagation from a horizontal wellbore. The model couples fracture deformation with fluid flow in the fractures and the horizontal wellbore. The displacement discontinuity method (DDM) is used to represent the mechanics of the fractures and their opening, including interaction effects between closely spaced fractures. Fluid flow in the fractures is determined by the lubrication theory. Frictional pressure drop in the wellbore and perforation zones is taken into account by applying Kirchoff’s first and second laws. The fluid-flow rates and pressure compatibility are maintained between the wellbore and the multiple fractures with Newton’s numerical method. The model generates physically realistic multiple-fracture geometries and nonplanar-fracture trajectories that are consistent with physical-laboratory results and inferences drawn from microseismic diagnostic interpretations. One can use the simulation results of the FPM for sensitivity analysis of in-situ and fracture treatment parameters for shale-gas stimulation design. They provide a physics-based complex fracture network that one can import into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis. Furthermore, the results from the model can highlight conditions under which restricted width occurs that could lead to proppant screenout. "

In addition to inelastic deformations, this model incorporates rock anisotropies like toughness anisotropy due to the bedding planes orientation that is a common observation in Shales. The pressure sensitive inelastic deformation of porous rocks together with their damage mechanisms are studied for drained and undrained conditions. Fracture mechanics of microcrack and micro-void nucleation and their coalescence are incorporated into the formulation of the CDM models to accurately capture different failure modes of rocks. The performance of the developed elastoplastic and CDM models are compared with the available test data of a specific shale play and then the models are introduced into a commercial finite element package through user-defined subroutines. A workflow to derive the required model parameters for both intact rock and cemented natural fractures is presented through inverse modelling of test data. The hydraulic fractures growth in the reservoir scale is then simulated; in which the effect of fluid viscosity, natural fractures characteristics and differential stresses on induced fracture network is studied. The simulation results are compared with the available solutions in the literature. The developed CDM model outperforms the traditional fracture mechanics approaches by removing stress singularities at the fracture tips and simulation of progressive fractures without any essential need for remeshing. This model would provide a robust tool for modeling hydraulic fracture growth using conventional elements of FEA with a computational cost less than similar computational techniques like cohesive element methods.

                    "abstract": "Core studies have revealed the presence of abundant cemented microfractures in many tight formations. Further independent studies have revealed the opening of some of these microfractures on the wall surface of main hydraulic fractures. In addition, early-production well-testing analysis in some of these cases provides estimates for the hydraulically-induced-fracture surface area, which is much larger than fracture dimensions estimated in fracturing design or provided by the location of microseismic events. Opening of small-sized fractures could be a possible reason for this discrepancy. In this paper, we show to what extent thermal stresses induced by temperature difference between fracturing fluid and formation fluid could provide the driving force to open a portion of these small, cemented natural fractures lying on the surface of hydraulic fractures. Moreover, through combination of stress analysis and empirical fracture-distribution models obtained from outcrops, we calculate the increase of total reservoir/fracture contact surface under the condition of microfracture activation. Our thermoelasticity analysis reveals the effect of the pump rate and temperature of the fracturing fluid on the number of activated microfractures. The results show that the volume of the microfractures varies depending on the length of the microfracture, rock properties, and time. At the end of the paper, through an example, we show that activation of only a small portion of these microfractures can increase the total fracture/formation contact area considerably and, consequently, increase initial production. Reservoir-pressure changes caused by production might partially close or reopen these microcracks during production; hence, the effectiveness of these microfractures could be mainly restricted to the early life of the reservoirs.

Both the short rod (SR) and double torsion (DT) test methods give comparable results for multiple test specimens from the same samples. Co2-related alteration at the Crystal Geyser field site is reflected in the bulk mineralogy of siltstone samples collected near fossil Co2 seeps and primarily characterized by an increase in calcite. Dissolution of Fe-cements, along with the remobilization and precipitation of secondary carbonates and clays noted by petrography, are likely responsible for the geomechanical weakening effect in sandstones. Subcritical crack index, another fracture parameter obtained from the DT test, is also affected by Co2-related alteration. These results suggest that long-term mechanical behavior of Co2 reservoir and seal rocks may be affected by interaction with Co2-rich fluids requiring the consideration of coupled chemical-geomechanical processes and time-dependent geomechanical behavior in Co2 reservoir simulations.

Similar to many faults, disaggregation deformation bands are consistent with a power-law scaling relation having a slope of approximately c = 1, implying a linear dependence of maximum displacement and discontinuity length (Dmax = γL). In contrast, dilatant fractures, cataclastic deformation bands, and shear-enhanced compaction bands are consistent with a power-law scaling relation with a slope of approximately c = 0.5, implying a dependence of maximum displacement on the square root of length (Dmax = αL1/2).

These fracturing treatments are often mapped by use of hypocenters of induced microseismic events. In some cases, the microseismic mapping shows asymmetry of the induced-fracture geometry with respect to the injection well. In addition, the conventional theories predict fracture propagation along a path normal to the least compressive in-situ stresses, whereas in some cases the microseismic data suggest fracture propagation parallel to the minimum compressive stress. In this paper, we present an extended-finite-element-method (XFEM) model that can simulate asymmetric fracture-wing development as well as diversion of the fracture path along natural fractures. Simulation results demonstrate the sensitivity of the fracture-pattern geometry to differential stress and natural-fracture orientation with respect to the in-situ maximum compressive stress. We examine the properties of sealed natural fractures that are commonin formations such as the Barnett shale and show that they may still serve as weak paths for hydraulic-fracture beginning and/or diversion. The presented model predicts faster fracture propagation in formations where natural fractures are favorably aligned with the tectonic stresses. "

Although many fracture models are based on two-dimensional approximations, accurately predicting fracture propagation geometry requires accounting for the three-dimensional aspects of fractures. We focus on the effects of fracture height on lateral propagation of vertical fractures using a 3-D displacement discontinuity model to investigate the curving path and the angle of intersection for overlapping fractures, and the evolution of stress intensity factor and energy release rate during propagation around the fracture periphery. Results show the curving path is strongly influenced by the spacing to height ratio of the overlapping fractures as well as the differential stress magnitude. In addition, the angle of intersection between two non-coincident but parallel en echelon fractures is shown to depend strongly on fracture height to length ratio, with intersection angles being asymptotic for “tall” fractures (large height to spacing ratios) and nearly orthogonal for “short” fractures. Fracture height to spacing ratio also affects mode III deformation and twist hackle generation. The degree of mixed mode I-III loading caused by non-planar parent crack propagation is highlighted in addition to the more conventional of spatial or temporal remote stress orientation changes. "

Radial extension tests (decreasing mean stress) result in larger increases in permeability upon failure and dilatancy, and lower residual oil and higher initial water saturations. Finally, failure induced by unloading through pore pressure increase, run under fixed displacement, fixed stress, or mixed axial versus confining boundary conditions, show minimal permeability changes until the effective stresses approach zero.  However, the increase in initial water saturation and decrease in residual oil saturation are as significant as or greater than what was seen in the triaxial compression and radial extension tests.  Overall, results show that lab experiments support increased permeability due to steam injection operations in heavy oil, and more importantly, the observed reduction in residual oil saturation implies SAGD induced deformation should improve recovery factors.  1. Introduction About 70% of the oil in the world is categorized as having less than 20oAPI gravity and is found in unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs less than 1000 m deep (Dusseault, 2001), that is, the majority of world oil reserves consist of heavy oil, extra-heavy oil and bitumen (Fig. 1). Heavy oil deposits are defined as the petroleum resources which are between 10 and 20oAPI gravity, while extra-heavy oil deposits are those which are less than 10oAPI gravity.  Natural Bitumen is reported in 598 deposits in 23 countries, which amounts to 3.3 trillion barrels of total original oil in place (World Energy Council, 2010). These deposits occur both in clastic and carbonate rocks and commonly close to the earth's surface. Extra-heavy oil is found in 162 deposits in 21 countries, and amounts to 3.1 trillion barrels of total original oil in place (World Energy Council, 2010).  Canada's recoverable oil sands resources (28 trillion m3 or 177 billion barrels) are roughly comparable to Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves (Table 1). After Canada, the largest bitumen volumes are found in Kazakhstan and Russia. The majority of the Kazakh deposits are found in the North Caspian Basin, while many of Russia's bitumen deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Ural basins (World Energy Council, 2010). These deposits are geologically similar to the Western Canada bitumen deposits (Meyer et al., 2007).  Venezuela's Orinoco Belt contains extra-heavy crude oil in comparable quantity to Canada's bitumen deposits.

                    "abstract": "Micro seismic data and coring studies suggest that hydraulic fractures interact heavily with natural fractures creating complex fracture networks in naturally fractured reservoirs such as the Barnett shale, the Eagle Ford shale, and the Marcellus shale. However, since direct observations of subsurface hydraulic fracture geometries are incomplete or nonexistent, we look to properly scaled experimental research and computer modeling based on realistic assumptions to help us understand fracture intersection geometries. Most experimental analysis of this problem has focused on natural fractures with frictional interfaces. However, core observations from the Barnett and other shale plays suggest that natural fractures are largely cemented. To examine hydraulic fracture interactions with cemented natural fractures, we performed 9 hydraulic fracturing experiments in gypsum cement blocks that contained embedded planar glass, sandstone, and plaster discontinuities which acted as proxies for cemented natural fractures. There were three main fracture intersection geometries observed in our experimental program. 1) A hydraulic fracture is diverted into a different propagation path(s) by a natural fracture. 2) A taller hydraulic fracture bypasses a shorter natural fracture by propagating around it via height growth while also separating the weakly bonded interface between the natural fracture and the host rock. 3) A hydraulic fracture bypasses a natural fracture and also diverts down it to form separate fractures. The three main factors that seemed to have the strongest influence on fracture intersection geometry were the angle of intersection, the ratio of hydraulic fracture height to natural fracture height, and the differential stress. Simply put, the most significant finding of this research is that fracture intersection geometries are complex. Our results show that bypass, separation of weakly bonded interfaces, diversion, and mixed mode propagation are likely in hydraulic fracture intersections with cemented natural fractures. The impact of this finding is that we need fully 3D computer models capable of accounting for bypass and mixed mode I-III fracture propagation in order to realistically simulate subsurface hydraulic fracture geometries.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Shear failure plays an important role in fracture propagation in poorly consolidated formations. In past work, the effect of shear failure on the permeability and porosity of sands has been inconclusive. In this paper, a three-dimensional discrete element model is used to estimate changes in porosity and permeability due to mechanical deformation of sand-packs. Using pore network fluid flow simulations, the effect of shear failure and stress anisotropy on the permeability anisotropy and dilation of the granular specimens is analyzed.  Mechanical deformation data from experiments conducted on cylindrical sand packs is used to calibrate the simulations. Using these calibrated models, anisotropic stress regimes are modeled to mechanically deform the simulated samples. Post-processing tools have been developed to observe the preferential orientation of failure planes. Pore network fluid simulations describe the orientation of the permeability tensor. The principal permeability values of an anisotropically stressed sample are described in 3-D.  Deformation of the samples induces shear failure planes, which are preferentially oriented along the maximum horizontal stress direction. Deformed samples with the same minimum horizontal stress (50 psi) but increasing maximum horizontal stresses (50 psi to 300 psi) show an increase in the permeability in the maximum horizontal stress direction by 28-38%. An increase in horizontal stress anisotropy is shown to result in an increase in permeability in all directions due to dilation and failure. The effect of confining pressure, grain size distribution and sorting on failure, permeability anisotropy and dilation is also studied.  The resultant permeability anisotropy induced by shear failure and dilation is of vital significance for simulating fracturing and flow processes in soft rock formations.  Introduction Fracture propagation in unconsolidated and poorly consolidated sands has been shown to be a result of shear failure accompanied by greater leak-off and plastic deformation (Khodaverdian & McElfresh 2000). Mechanical deformation of formations leads to development of shear failure zones (Agarwal and Sharma 2011a). Localization of shear failure zones in the sand samples can lead to dilation of samples (Larsen & Fjaer 1999). This shear band formation has been observed in both experiments and simulations (Bruno et al. 1991; Bardet & Proubet 1992; Horabik et al. 2000; Zhou & Chi 2003; Hu 2004; Zhai and Sharma 2005; Alonso-Marroquin et al. 2007; Riedel et al. 2008; Castelli et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010; Schall & Hecke 2010; Agarwal and Sharma 2011b).  Mechanical deformation can also lead to variation in the fluid flow response through the samples. Various experiments have been conducted by numerous researchers to describe the influence of stress anisotropy, stress path, compaction and mechanical deformation of rock on the permeability evolution of the rock samples (Hyman et al. 1991; Bruno et al. 1991; Zhu et al. 1997; Bai et al. 2002; Wong 2003; Dautriat et al. 2007; Clavaud et al. 2008; Dautriat et al. 2009; Khan 2009; Olson et al. 2009). Numerous computer simulations have also been performed to establish the effect of mechanical deformation on permeability evolution in rocks (Bruno et al. 1996; Karacan et al. 2001; Li & Holt 2002; Wong 2003; Holt et al. 2005; Yaich 2008).  Bruno (1994) reported a comprehensive account of stress-induced permeability anisotropy and damage in sedimentary rock and the underlying micromechanics.  As compressive stress is first applied to a sample, micro-fractures occur at grain boundaries and are predominantly oriented parallel to the primary loading axis. The micro-cracks are initially distributed uniformly throughout the sample and later coalesce and concentrate in narrow deformation bands. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Field experience in shale gas and some tight gas sandstones suggests significant interaction between hydraulic fractures and natural fractures. Experimental analysis of this problem has mostly focused on frictional interfaces with regard to the natural fractures. We have performed tests to examine the effect of cemented natural fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation. The motivation for this type of work is that core observations from the Barnett and some other shale gas plays suggest that natural fractures are largely cemented (or healed) and trend obliquely or orthogonally to the present day hydraulic fracture direction.  We embedded planar glass discontinuities into a cast hydrostone block as proxies for cemented natural fractures. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our results show that oblique embedded fractures are more likely to divert a fluid-driven hydraulic fracture than those occurring orthogonal to the induced fracture path. Hydraulic fracture - natural fracture interaction took three forms - 1) the hydraulic fracture bypassing the natural fracture by propagating around it (via height growth, not curving), 2) the hydraulic fracture arresting into the natural fracture and then diverting along it and sometimes kinking off the end of it, and 3) a combination of bypass and diversion. We also saw some leakage of fracture fluid along the interfaces of multi-layer blocks, even though such interfaces were perpendicular to the maximum compressive stress, suggesting an analogue for laminated and shaly sedimentary sequences.  Introduction Complex hydraulic fracture geometry is considered to be a common place occurrence in naturally fractured reservoirs such as tight gas sandstones and shales, largely based on the interpretation of microseismic data (Fisher et al., 2002; Maxwell et al., 2002; Daniels et al., 2007; Le Calvez et al., 2007). The actual resultant geometry from hydraulic fracture treatments in rocks with natural fracture weaknesses, typically pumped from multiple injection zones spaced along extensive horizontal wells, is still a topic of discussion and debate. The best direct evidence of fracture geometry has come from mineback studies, where realistic fracturing fluids have been injected into realistic wellbores but often at very shallow depths or in igneous or metamorphic rock (Warpinski and Teufel, 1987; Jeffrey et al., 1995). These types of studies report hydraulic fracture diversion along natural planes of weakness such as natural fracture and bedding planes. Multiple fractures can propagate simultaneously parallel to one another, but under many circumstances, one fracture plane will eventually dominate. Coring across hydraulic fracture trends has shown that such multiple parallel fractures are present in tight gas sandstones (Warpinski et al., 1993; Branagan et al., 1996). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Successful shale gas and tight oil applications require multiple hydraulic fracture treatments in a given horizontal well. Key design considerations are the spacing between injection zones, the size of the treatments, and the injection parameters (primarily rate and viscosity). Other important parameters are whether to inject into multiple zones simultaneously or sequentially, and whether to coordinate fracturing between multiple adjacent horizontal wells. We investigate various injection scenarios using two different \"pseudo-3d?? boundary element, displacement discontinuity method based hydraulic fracture simulators. A single fracture model couples the injection of non-Newtonian fluid, Carter leak-off behavior, arbitrary non-planar propagation, and height growth in a 3-layered media. The second model is designed to be more computational efficient and stable by simplifying the fracture fluid flow calculation. Fracture pressure variation through time is approximated by summing the inverse of width cubed over the created fracture network, and wellbore pressure is equated to the predicted summative pressure drop in the system. Results indicate that sequential fracturing geometries are highly dependent on injection zone spacing relative to fracture height - when fractures are closely spaced relative to stress shadow size, fracture path diversion and intersection as well as net pressure effects are likely. This strong mechanical interaction scenario promotes fracture complexity (which can be an advantage in some formations), but reduces the penetration distance of fracture wings away from the wellbore. Simultaneous fracturing of multiple stages is also strongly influenced by the spacing to height ratio - the closer the spacing the more difficult it is to get substantial growth from all completed zones.

                    "abstract": "Recent examples of hydraulic-fracture diagnostic data suggest that complex, multistranded hydraulic-fracture geometry is a common occurrence. This reality is in stark contrast to the industry-standard design models based on the assumption of symmetric, planar, biwing geometry. The interaction between pre-existing natural fractures and the advancing hydraulic fracture is a key condition leading to complex fracture patterns. Performing hydraulic-fracture-design calculations under these less-than-ideal conditions requires modeling fracture intersections and tracking fluid fronts in the network of reactivated fissures. Whether a hydraulic fracture crosses or is arrested by a pre-existing natural fracture is controlled by shear strength and potential slippage at the fracture intersections, as well as potential debonding of sealed cracks in the near-tip region of a propagating hydraulic fracture. We present a complex hydraulic-fracture pattern propagation model based on the extended finite-element method (XFEM) as a design tool that can be used to optimize treatment parameters under complex propagation conditions. Results demonstrate that fracture-pattern complexity is strongly controlled by the magnitude of anisotropy of in-situ stresses, rock toughness, and natural-fracture cement strength, as well as the orientation of the natural fractures relative to the hydraulic fracture. Analysis shows that the growing hydraulic fracture may exert enough tensile and shear stresses on cemented natural fractures that the latter may be debonded, opened, and/or sheared in advance of hydraulic-fracture-tip arrival, while under other conditions, natural fractures will be unaffected by the hydraulic fracture. Detailed aperture distributions at the intersection between fracture segments show the potential for difficulty in proppant transport under complex fracture-propagation conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) can cause dilatant shear failure in unconsolidated heavy oil reservoirs. Our experimental work documents changes induced by such shear failure in absolute permeability, relative permeability to oil and water, and residual saturations. Tests were performed on 2 inch diameter synthetic specimens made from lower fine to medium grain size Ottawa sand formed with wet vibration to an initial porosity of about 32%. Loading paths included triaxial compression and radial extension. Axial and volumetric strains were measured directly during deformation, and single and two phase permeability tests were executed at axial strains of 1 to 10%. Triaxial compression tests followed a path of increasing mean stress (under constant confining stress) while radial extension tests provided a decreasing mean stress loading path (reducing confining stress under constant axial stress). The relative permeability was determined by the unsteady state method for relative permeability endpoint assessment. Results show similar absolute permeability trends to those published by others, but our multiphase measurements appear unique. Relative permeabilities are more strongly influenced by shearing, with water relative permeabilities being increase by as much as a factor of 2. The effect seems to be slightly greater for finer grain sand than for the medium grain size. Absolute permeability changes were greatest for the samples with the lowest initial porosity, which would include those that were poorer sorted. Poorer sorting of the sand pack seems to reduce the impact on relative permeability changes, however. Residual oil saturations were reduced from 0.28 to 0.13 in the lower fine Ottawa sample, suggesting the possibility for significant improvement in oil recovery when the sand is sheared. During triaxial testing, it was interesting to note that at 50 psi effective confining stress, absolute permeability increased with shearing, but at 200 psi effective confining stress, absolute permeability was reduced, even though the volumetric strain was still dilatant. In addition to providing new data on the magnitude of absolute permeability and multi-phase flow properties for unconsolidated sands, this paper also demonstrates that dilatant shear failure does not guarantee increased flow capacity for such rocks.  Introduction Increased energy demands dictate the use of new and innovative thermal EOR techniques that can increase recovery factors from heavy oil reservoirs. Steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) has been widely successful in shallow oil sands in Canada. One geomechanical aspect of this process is change in permeability due to steam injection induced deformation. As the expanding steam chamber around the injector causes pore pressure increase, it modifies the stress distribution in the reservoir and can induce shear failure. The loading stress path for this process is one of decreasing mean effective stress in the steam chamber while the areas immediately surrounding the steam chamber may experience a stress path of increasing mean stress (Chalaturnyk et al., 1997; Tohidi-Baghini, 1998; Oldakowski, 1994; Yaich, 2008). Volumetric dilation as a result of shearing is expected to increase formation porosity and permeability. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of uncemented sand was investigated with theoretical calculations and physical laboratory experiments to investigate crack tip mechanics for soft rock applications.  The mechanics of soft rock fracturing is an important topic for the better understanding of injection operations in weakly or unconsolidated sands.  Fracpack treatments, waste injection, and steam injection for heavy oil recovery are all applications for which the application of standard elastic hydraulic fracturing models may be inadequate due to expected nonelastic deformation components. Analytical calculations indicate that shear associated with hydraulic fracturing is likely in unconsolidated sands at depth, but cases of high overpressure promote tensile mode fracturing.  An expression is derived to predict the rock strength required in terms of UCS to achieve tensile fracture.  Preliminary physical experiments were performed to ascertain failure mode in uncemented sand at low confining stress and to investigate shear failure under high viscosity injection.  Physical specimens were created using sand ranging from 100 to 300 micron in diameter, compacted with wet vibration.  Preliminary fracture opening experiments performed using solid wedging were imaged with a CT-scanner and demonstrated near-tip shear failure propagating diagonally away from the crack tip, but not along the in-plane propagation direction.  Injection experiments indicated complex fracture propagation geometries involved fracture plane segmentation and curving.  Preliminary results indicate fracture propagation mode is predominantly tensile and not shear, although deformation in the vicinity of the hydraulic fracture showed evidence of shear.  Higher stress anisotropy is anticipated to increase the likelihood of shear failure over tensile failure. Introduction The failure of weak rocks and sediments can be induced by broad pore pressure change or more localized injection.  Zhou et al. (2010) investigated the inducement of failure in sands at moderate confining stress (on the order of 2 MPa) due to high viscosity injection and found nominally planar fracture propagation at low confining stress in sand, presumably representing a tensile mode hydraulic fracture.  Khodaverdian et al. (2009) performed low pressure injections with results suggesting the propagation of shear zones in a preferential orientation perpendicular to SHmax, but found it difficult to observe shear indicators in post-mortem observations of the test specimens.  However, they concluded that shear failure was most likely in cased of high leak-off fluid where effective stress change could occur in the rock near the wellbore and fracture zone.  Xu and Wong (2010) modeled hydraulic fracturing in unconsolidated sands as a shear-dilated plastic zone to match treating pressures from shallow waste injection well data.  These studies, among others, suggest that there are injection conditions under which high permeability zones may propagate out from an injection well in a manner somewhat like a tensile hydraulic fracture, but the predominant failure mechanism is shear.  This study is a preliminary effort to examine the in situ stress, rock strength and injection conditions that might control the transition from fracture propagation due to tensile failure and shear failure.

The analysis of time-dependent wellbore stability in shales has largely concentrated on the influence of fluid chemistry and filtrate invasion into the formation to predict compressive failure using poroelasticity and continuum models. This paper presents another possible mechanism for time-dependent behavior--stress-corrosion cracking (subcritical crack growth). Using the discrete-element method (DEM) to simulate grain-scale processes, we apply the concept of time-dependent cracking to hole enlargement for vertical wellbores. We use a published example from the North Sea to verify the stress-corrosion model and demonstrate the application to wellbore stability in shale. Laboratory results on rocks indicate a wide range of susceptibility to stress-corrosion cracking related to rock petrology and contact-fluid chemistry. Using laboratory calibrated rock properties, we run 2D, plane-strain simulations of vertical-wellbore stability in shale, where hole enlargement is tracked through time. As a result of stress-corrosion cracking, the numerical models show a time-dependent failure history, with an initial stable period of varying duration (influenced by mud weight, rock properties, and in-situ stress), followed by a brief period of combined shear and tensile failure, and ending with stabilization at an enlarged, elliptically shaped geometry. Time to failure increases with increasing mud weight. Enlarged-hole shape changes from elliptical to roughly circular with decreasing stress anisotropy. These behaviors simulated by the stress-corrosion model coincide with previously reported field experience. This new modeling approach for time-dependent wellbore failure can be readily constrained with straight forward fracture-mechanics tests on rock samples and has the potential to also be applied to time-dependent, intermittent sand or fines generation during production.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Three hydraulic fracturing have been performed in the Torunos field of southwest Venezuela. One was executed in the Gobernador \"A/B\" formation in which the fracture reached a water zone located nearby. The other two treatments were performed in the Escandalosa \"O\" formation. Placing the proppant into this formation was problematic owing to propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures and excessive leak-off. Today, several wells are inactive because of low productivity. Such wells could be potential candidates for reactivation by hydraulic fracturing if the problems encountered in previous treatments can be avoided. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to optimize the design of hydraulic fracturing treatments in the formations under consideration while avoiding the problems encountered in the previous attempts. Experimental design and response surface methods were used to perform sensitivity analyses and to evaluate uncertainty to optimize the design of hydraulic fracturing treatments. Experimental design was used to generate a reduced number of cases with simultaneous combinations of uncertain variables. Simulation of the cases generated was then performed, assisted by a commercial simulator. Response surface method was used to develop surrogate equation models that fit the simulation responses. Monte Carlos analysis was performed to estimate the probability distribution function of the propped fracture length, propped fracture height, depth to the fracture bottom, and net present value (NPV) to select the optimum designs based on technical, economical, and risk analyses. The results show that the optimum hydraulic fracturing treatment design for the Gobernador \"A/B\" formation should involve small slurry volume (around 300 bbl), a low injection rate (between 6 bbl/min and 8 bbl/min), and low viscosity crosslinked fluid (20 cp). This will control the fracture height and avoid fracturing the water zone. Moreover, reducing the perforated interval to around 20 ft and using low density shot (1 SPF) will help to minimize the propagation of multiple hydraulic fractures in the Escandalosa \"O\" formation. Finally, the optimum injection rate and slurry volume in this formation are 20 bbl/min and 800 bbl respectively.  Introduction Hydraulic fracturing has been improving significantly since this technique started in 1948 (Hubbert, 1987). It is a stimulation procedure that aims to improve oil and gas recovery by overcoming the effects of formation damage and low permeability, accelerating production, and controlling water production and formation of solids (Elbel and Britt, 2000). Hydraulic fracturing treatments have been performed in several types of formations including clastics, carbonates, shales, and coals. This study involves the optimization design of hydraulic fracturing treatments in a clastic and carbonate formation in the Torunos field of southwest Venezuela, where three hydraulic treatments have been performed.

Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the oil recovery at the field scale. Several previous studies suggested that fingering can be ignored at the field scale because channeling (caused by heterogeneity) is dominant, but they missed the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. In our work, we consider that fingering and channeling coexist in the field across different scales, based on the fact that the heterogeneity increases with the scale. At the small-scale (e.g., lab-scale) where heterogeneity is small, fingering is dominant and causes oil bypassing. An effective-fingering model was developed to scale up fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, oil single-phase flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth factors of different regions, and they are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history-matches of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, fluid velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved at the lab-scale by considering relatively homogeneous cores. We extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatially accurate numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using gridblock sizes that are roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number for a gridblock at the field-scale affected by various heterogeneities. It is also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a synthetic field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. It is observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. "

A novel three-phase capillary pressure model has been used to estimate the effect of connate water on the gas/oil capillary pressure. The model is then used in conjunction with the new stability method to solve several phase-behavior problems for binary and multicomponent reservoir fluids.

                    "abstract": "Six coreflood experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of hydrolyzed-polyacrylamide (HPAM) polymer solutions on the residual oil saturation (ROS) in Bentheimer-sandstone cores. All six cores were first saturated with brine and then flooded in the following sequence: oil to zero water cut, brine to zero oil cut, glycerin solution to zero oil cut, polymer in low-salinity brine to zero oil cut, and finally polymer in high-salinity brine to zero oil cut. The first polymer solution had approximately the same viscosity as the glycerin solution. The first polymer flood was designed to maximize the effect of viscoelasticity on the ROS by flooding the cores at a high Deborah number (NDe), and, as expected, resulted in a lower ROS. The second polymer flood in high-salinity brine had approximately the same viscosity, but a much lower relaxation time, and the flood had a much lower NDe. Unexpectedly, there was a further substantial reduction in ROS during the second polymer flood. The lowest ROS after the second polymer flood was only 0.07. This is a truly remarkable result, considering that there was no reduction in interfacial tension (IFT), the capillary numbers were maintained below the critical capillary number for Bentheimer sandstone, and the viscosities of both polymer solutions were equal to or less than that of the glycerin solution.

                    "abstract": "Single well chemical tracer tests were used to measure saturations and oil-water fractional flow accurately, quickly, and cost-effectively. The Aurora oil field in the Prudhoe Bay Unit, Alaska, was identified for fast-paced development leveraging existing facilities. A series of single well chemical tracer tests (SWTT) determined key volumetric and reservoir performance properties including: Initial oil saturation, Waterflood residual oil saturation, Miscible gas EOR residual oil saturation, and Waterflood water-oil fractional flow.  The SWTT measurements of initial oil saturation, residual oil saturation to water, residual oil saturation to miscible gas, and oil-water fractional flow made during the initial field development in 2001 closely match current model parameters determined based upon 18 years of field history. Given a fast development pace and relatively small field size, it was deemed impractical to collect low invasion core and perform expensive, complex, and time consuming special core analysis. Instead, a series of SWTT were performed on a single production well to determine key reservoir parameters within six months. This compares favorably to core acquisition and analysis which can take six times longer and cost ten times as much. Also, SWTT can be performed after a well is drilled and on production, so key tests can be performed without early, time-intensive special core analysis acquisition planning and rig time. Aurora production well S-104 was chosen as the key data collection well to describe Aurora field. The well was conventionally cored and had a full suite of open hole logs including nuclear magnetic resonance and focused micro resistivity. This well was an ideal candidate for a SWTT as it had a good quality cement job, no water or gas injection, a detailed near wellbore reservoir description, and the well would produce to surface with gas lift. The SWTTs were performed over a 30-foot perforated interval. A typical SWTT involves tracer injection, shut-in time, then production flowback. No downhole interventions were needed since SWTT are performed using readily transportable surface equipment like chemical injection pumps and well tracer sampling and measurement equipment including a gas chromatograph. Connate water saturation was lower than expected (13% ±2), increasing the estimated oil in place and calibrating the well log water saturation log model and reservoir model saturation-height function. Due to increased initial oil saturation proved by the SWTT, additional wells were justified in the southern portion of the field which added an estimated 2.5 million barrels of recovery. The waterflood residual oil saturation was higher than expected (30% ±2) indicating a more oil-wet system than previously assumed. The oil-water fractional flow data also indicated a more oil wet relative permeability curve than estimates from available analog curves. Finally, the miscible gas EOR test demonstrated miscibility and enhanced oil recovery in-situ by measuring very low residual oil saturation (4.5% ±2) to miscible injection gas. This is the world's first successful SWTT water-oil fractional flow measurement. If data collection had included downhole pressure gauges, the test would have also measured relative permeability endpoints. The Aurora SWTT program provides an innovative solution to a classic challenge: Accurately determining key reservoir properties in a timely and cost-effective way. Reservoir simulation using SWTT results match 18 years of field performance, demonstrating the accuracy of SWTT measurements. "

The high pH reduces the adsorption of anionic surfactants by changing the surface charge of the limestone from positive to negative as well as having other favorable geochemical effects. Sodium carbonate could not be used in these experiments to increase the pH because the Indiana Limestone rock contained gypsum, which causes calcium carbonate to precipitate when it dissolves. Another advantage of sodium hydroxide is that much lower concentrations are needed compared to sodium carbonate because of its lower molecular weight. No adverse reactions between the sodium hydroxide and limestone were observed and the propagation of the pH in the corefloods was observed to be extremely favorable. The tertiary oil recovery was high and the surfactant retention using sodium hydroxide was low compared to experiments without alkali and compared to typical retention values reported in the literature for carbonates.

                    "abstract": "Water soluble polymers have been used for decades as mobility control agents for tertiary recovery processes. Viscosity is conferred by the large hydrated size of the individual high molecular weight polymer molecules; their single-molecule hydrated size is so large that it can rival the diameters of the pore throats conducting the fluid, and it is widely understood that there are permeability limits below which solutions of such polymers cannot transport well. Delineating exactly where these limits are remains challenging, and operators are left to use whatever anecdotal evidence is available to decide whether to inject polymer, and, if so, what type and molecular weight to use. A rule of thumb is that when the permeability of a rock falls below 100 millidarcys, transport can be problematic. We have developed processing techniques for laboratory tests to condition polymer solutions for injection into reservoir carbonate cores with permeabilities below 10 millidarcys and median pore radii below one micron. Shearing and tight filtration were used to reduce the maximum size of polymers in solution while retaining as much viscosity as possible. Subsequent filtration was used to quantitatively assess the plugging behavior of the product solution across a range of pore sizes smaller than those which conduct in the rock sample. Coreflood injectivity tests revealed the onset of face plugging as a function of average polymer size. Co-solvent was shown to dramatically improve the transport of sulfonated polyacrylamides when face plugging did not occur, and those improvements were mirrored in benchtop filtration data. This improvement came despite equal-or-better viscosity in the polymer solution, demonstrating that the co-solvent did not reduce the polymer's hydrated size and therefore most likely weakens inter-molecular associations in solution. In sum, the data indicate that permeability loss occurred by two mechanisms: simple mechanical plugging and progressive adsorption, likely mediated by inter-molecular entanglements. These two permeability reduction mechanisms should be rectified by different means. "

The model is sufficiently accurate to provide a useful guide to an experimental testing program for the development of chemical EOR formulations. There are thousands of combinations of surfactants and co-solvents that could be tested for each oil, so even approximate predictions are very useful in terms of reducing the time and effort required for testing and for prioritizing the chemical combinations to test that are most likely to yield ultra-low IFT at reservoir conditions. The effects of changing molecular structures (e.g. swapping head groups, swapping hydrophobes, increasing the length of hydrophobes, increasing the number of PO and EO groups, adjusting the ratios of surfactants) are shown. The variables with the greatest impact on the optimum salinity and solubilization ratio were identified, and methods are proposed to shift the optimum salinity and the optimum solubilization ratios in any desired direction. The structure-property model was developed and tested using a large dataset consisting of 684 microemulsion phase behavior experiments using 24 oils. The chemical formulations used 85 surfactants and 18 co-solvents in various combinations. Both optimum salinity and optimum solubilization ratio (and thus IFT) are modeled whereas other models have focused almost exclusively on the optimum salinity. Predicting the optimum solubilization ratio is actually of more value because of its relationship to IFT. The models include the effects of co-solvent partitioning, soap formation and the molecular structure of both the surfactants and co-solvents. "

A four-phase chemical flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM) was used to history match a published core flood experiment and simulate a pilot-scale case. The results from the history match reveale that interfacial tension (IFT) reduction between oil and water by surfactant, displacement of oil by gas, and the mobility control of gas are the main mechanims lead to a substantioal increase in oil recovery. Based on these key findings, modeling of the low-tension surfactant-gas flood shows that such a process is very positive for low permeability reservoirs with a 90% oil recovery of the initial oil saturation (Sio=0.56) in a coreflood experiment and a range of recovery factors between 50% to 70% of the water flood in large scale cases.

A combination of bulk mineralogy, elemental composition analysis, dissolution behavior, and water ionic composition data were used to characterize the samples’ surface heterogeneity. The adsorption of anionic surfactants is 2.4 mg/m2 at pH of ∼8 and decreases approximately linearly with pH values above 9. To constrain and compare the relative adsorption affinity and the likely modes of attachment on mineral constituents as pH changes, we performed surface complexation calculations using a two-surface multisite diffuse layer model. We propose the formation of two surface species on both the major (i.e., calcite) and trace (i.e., the oxide-like sites on the edges of clay platelets) minerals: a monodentate inner-sphere complex and a weak or hydrogen bonding complex. Our modeling results suggest that charge-regulated inner-sphere complexation is the dominant adsorption mechanism on the calcite and oxide-like sites at low pH values regardless of the surface loading. We found weak or hydrogen bond adsorption to be significant on the calcite surface, and this became the dominant adsorption mode at pH ∼10. While the adsorption on calcite increases with surface loading, adsorption on the oxide-like sites remains independent of surface loading. These results suggest that surfactant adsorption can be comparable on the abundant low-surface-area calcite and trace high-surface-area oxide-like sites. "

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the interfacial composition and steady and dynamic rheology to characterize the bicontinuous middle-phase samples. Measurements confirmed that phenol-2EO acted as cosolvent. A systematic shift of phase type is observed by increasing the cosolvent-to-surfactant content in the initial water/surfactant solution. Furthermore, it was observed that the interfacial ratio of cosolvent to surfactant controls the microemulsion composition, viscosity, and volume.

An example is the Sabriyah Mauddud reservoir in Kuwait. Alkaline-surfactant polymer flooding (ASP) has great potential for enhanced oil recovery both because ASP flooding reduces residual oil saturation and because of the polymer improves sweep efficiency. Unfortunately, the initial ASP coreflood experiments using conventional alkali showed unacceptably high surfactant retention in the reservoir cores. Several approaches to reducing surfactant retention were tested. Numerous strategies such as the use of chelating agents, sacrificial agents and chemical gradients were tested to reduce retention. The most effective strategy used a hybrid-alkali (NaOH + Na2CO3) in addition to a hydrophilic polymer drive containing a novel co-solvent. In this approach injection pH was increased to 12.5, compared to 10.5 using only Na2CO3. Such high pH is undesirable in sandstones because of reactions with silica minerals, but theexperimental results described here suggest the process is suitable for carbonate reservoirs. With this approach, both low surfactant retention and high oil recovery were achieved in very tight reservoir cores (8-35 mD). This novel approach was validated in a live oil coreflood using preserved cores to represent the reservoir material in the most rigorous way possible. This significant decrease in surfactant retention makes ASP flooding in the Sabriyah Mauddud reservoir viable. "

Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of scale on the oil recovery from cores with different dimensions under low-IFT conditions. There was a particular need to perform experiments by use of cores with larger horizontal dimensions because nearly all previous experiments have been performed in cores with a small diameter, typically 3.8 cm. We adapted and modified the experimental method used for traditional static-imbibition experiments by flushing out fluids surrounding the cores periodically to better estimate the oil recovery, including the produced emulsion. We used microemulsion-phase-behavior tests to develop surfactant formulations used in this study. These surfactants gave ultralow IFT at optimum salinity and good aqueous stability. Although we used ultralow-IFT (approximately 0.002 dynes/cm) formulations for most of the experiments, we also performed tests at low IFT (approximately 0.3 dynes/cm) for comparison. A second major objective of this study was to develop a simple analytical model to predict the oil recovery as a function of vertical- and horizontal-fracture spacing, rock properties, and fluid properties. The model and experimental data were found to be in good agreement considering the many simplifications made to derive the model. The scaling implied by the model is significantly different from the traditional scaling groups in the literature. The model is useful for both interpreting the experiments and for scaling the results from the laboratory to the field. "

One of the biggest risks associated with such projects is the possibility of leakage. Detrimental environmental consequences present a need to study potential leakage scenarios. Stored CO2 may leak if possible leakage pathways are available and favorable. Pressure and temperature decrease from the leakage source to the surface. Below the CO2 saturation pressure, liquid condensation of the CO2 occurs. At even lower temperatures and pressures, in the presence of water, hydrate formation occurs. CO2-hydrate forms when free water is available and the temperature is below 283 K and pressure is below 647 psi. During leakage, decreases in the temperature and pressure results in a CO2 phase change that affects the leakage flux. The purpose of this study is to estimate the leakage flux for different scenarios taking thermodynamic phase changes into account. A numerical model with coupled mass and energy balances was developed and used to estimate the flux as a function of time. Due to wide temperature and pressure changes over the course of the simulation, an accurate fluid properties model is required to reduce fluid properties related errors. Multi-parameter Span-Wagner equation of state for CO2 is used to achieve this. The numerical model allows for CO2 to exist in gas, liquid and hydrate phases. Hydrate formation was modelled using the van der Waals-Platteeuw model. Heat flux from the surroundings play an important role in effecting a phase change. Example calculations indicate a cyclical nature of the leakage flux under certain conditions. These calculations indicate the importance pressure of the leakage source (aquifer), the amount of water in the pathway (fracture/faults), the geothermal gradient and the surface temperature besides the thickness and the permeability of the fracture.

By changing surfactant components, co-solvents, and the concentration of the co-solvents, we were able to successfully control the microemulsion viscosity at optimum salinity to optimize the critical velocities in each surfactant flood. The experiments with optimized microemulsions show that the surfactant-flood velocity can be significantly increased and still recover nearly 100% of the oil. "

Instead of using phase labels (gas/oil/solvent/aqueous) to define parameters such as relative permeability endpoints, residual saturations and exponents, the parameters are continuously interpolated between reference values using the Gibbs free energy of each phase at each time step. Models independent of phase label have many advantages in terms of both numerical stability and physical consistency.

                    "abstract": "Unstable floods and resulting viscous fingers remain a big challenge for reservoir simulation as the gridblock size is usually many orders larger than the viscous finger wavelength. This problem becomes especially pronounced with increasing applications of polymer and other chemical floods in the development of heavy oil reservoirs. Traditional reservoir simulators do not consider sub-grid viscous fingering effects and tend to overestimate the waterflood oil recovery. Using extremely fine grid models with centimeters size is unrealistic for field-scale simulations. While some researchers disregard viscous fingering by claiming that channeling dominates at the large scale for heterogeneous reservoirs, they miss the existence of viscous fingering at the small scale, which affects the displacement efficiency. To overcome this limitation, an effective-fingering model was developed to upscale fingering effects. The model divides each gridblock into three dynamic regions: two-phase flow, single phase oil flow, and bypassed-oil regions. Model parameters represent the maximum fraction of viscous fingering and the growth rates of different regions, which are used to modify flow functions. Model parameters from history match of a set of laboratory experiments show clear power-law correlations with a dimensionless viscous finger number, a function of viscosity ratio, velocity, permeability, interfacial tension, and core cross-sectional area. The correlation was achieved in the lab scale by considering homogeneous cores, and we extended it further to the field scale by performing high-order spatial accuracy numerical simulations at the intermediate scale using fine gridblock sizes roughly the same as that of the core. Geostatistical realizations of the permeability field were generated with various variances and correlation lengths. In a statistical way, we were able to quantify the viscous finger number valid for a gridblock at the field scale affected by various heterogeneities using the effective-fingering model. We also observed that channelized permeability distributions increase the viscous finger number drastically, showing the important role of channeling in such cases. This new model was applied to a field case with high heterogeneity undergoing water/polymer floods. We observed that the oil recovery was improved by the polymer slug because of the enhancement in both local displacement efficiency and sweep efficiency. In summary, we developed an upscaling model that provides a fresh-new insight on how to simulate unstable water/polymer floods at the field scale, which effectively accounts for the interplay of viscous fingering and channeling.

                    "abstract": "Polymer flooding has been commercially applied to a number of viscous oil fields in the past decade and gradually gained more popularity. Due to limited injectivity in viscous-oil reservoirs, a relatively low polymer viscosity is usually used to avoid excessive injection pressure. In such a case, mobility ratio of polymer solution to oil is much greater than one, which implies unstable flow and strong viscous fingering. Existing reservoir simulators lack the capability of modeling such a physical phenomenon. Since many viscous-oil reservoirs have high permeability contrast between layers, we are motivated to study, for the first time, the impact of crossflow between different layers considering the presence of viscous fingering. Numerical modeling polymer floods with crossflow in a layered viscous-oil reservoir is difficult due to two major challenges: first is how to correctly allocate flow rates from the wellbore to multiple layers; and second is how to capture the viscous fingering effect without using excessively fine grids. To address the first issue, we developed an implicit well-rate-allocation model based on the potential method, which fully couples all the wellbore segments of each well with reservoir gridblocks to ensure a physical wellbore pressure. To deal with the second challenge, we implemented the effective fingering model, which is an upscaling model that lumps all the viscous fingers in a coarse grid block into one fictitious finger to allow for accurate estimation of fingering strength and growth during unstable flows. Both models were validated individually against the analytical solution or experimental data. The integrative module including the two new capabilities was used to simulate a polymer flood following a waterflood in a layer-cake reservoir in North America with moderate oil viscosity. We observed the fast propagation of water fronts and small fingering fraction in high permeability layers during the waterflooding phase, indicating active channeling and viscous fingering. The subsequent polymer flooding minimized both factors of oil bypassing and led to stable flow and high sweep efficiency. Without the implicit well-rate-allocation model, crossflow was overestimated and wellbore pressures of different well blocks were not consistent. Without the effective-fingering model, oil recovery was overestimated due to the lack of accounting for viscous fingering. The simulation results indicated that polymer flooding improved both displacement and sweep efficiencies. The model has shown comprehensive capabilities in reservoir simulations of polymer floods including unstable floods and crossflows between layers. This is a major significance to optimization of non-thermal viscous-oil EOR projects and also making more informed operational decisions for field developments. "

Conducting and analyzing an interwell tracer test (IWTT) before starting an enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) flood provides specific information required to balance the pattern’s swept pore volume (PV) and to optimize chemical or solvent use. Tracer testing also plays an important role in EOR by establishing a baseline for estimating incremental volume swept and recovery factor. A key limitation to tracer testing is the time required to obtain a complete interpretation of the test results. Conventional interpretation methods require observing exponential decline in the tracer concentration from all producers; depending on the pattern size and processing rate, this can take many months or years. Meanwhile, the EOR flood is delayed, thereby eroding its value and reducing the remaining oil target. We have developed a method for analyzing tracer data from relatively early times that is based, in part, on a new way to extrapolate the tracer data, providing timely information to optimize flood performance. The extrapolation can be performed soon after the peak tracer concentration is observed in the well with the slowest response. We illustrate the extrapolation procedure with a synthetic, yet realistic, data set showing that the new methods result in a good approximation at much earlier times. We then compare ‘early time analysis’ swept PVs with the (correct) swept PVs using the complete tracer data set. We also discuss how early-time approximations can thus provide the opportunity to optimize chemical-flood performance and to enable field startup of EOR floods in a timely fashion. "

An alkali reduces surfactant adsorption on sandstone and carbonate rocks, and generates in-situ surfactant with acidic crude oils. Many reservoirs, especially carbonates, contain gypsum (or anhydrite), which is sparingly soluble in water. In such cases, a conventional alkali such as sodium carbonate cannot be added to alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) formulations because it precipitates as CaCO3 on interacting with gypsum (or anhydrite). In this study, we test ammonia as an alkali to perform ASP floods in carbonate cores containing gypsum. The concentration of calcium ions in the presence of gypsum when ammonia is used as alkali can be as high as 2000 ppm, depending on the brine salinity and composition. Therefore, surfactant and polymer selection study was performed to identify suitable candidates under high calcium concentrations. Oil recovery experiments were performed in carbonate cores containing gypsum, using ammonia as the alkali. PHREEQC, the USGS geochemical simulator, was used for reactive transport modeling and was found to be an effective tool for designing these corefloods. High pH propagation and good oil recovery was observed in the ASP coreflood performed in a carbonate core containing gypsum. Addition of sodium sulfate in injection brines decreased gypsum dissolution. Gypsum dissolution was also lower at higher temperatures and lower NaCl concentrations. The surfactant retention in the ASP coreflood using ammonia, however, was found to be about the same as that of the SP coreflood, even though a high pH propagation was observed during the ASP coreflood. A good agreement was observed between the measured concentration of the effluent ions from the corefloods and the PHREEQC simulations. "

However, surfactants are commonly tested using static imbibition cells without any imposed pressure gradient. Therefore, the effect of viscous pressure gradients was investigated by conducting a series of surfactant corefloods using fractured Silurian Dolomite and Texas Cream Limestone cores. The viscosity of the surfactant solution was increased by adding polymer or by changing the salinity of the aqueous surfactant solution, which affects the in-situ microemulsion viscosity. The fractured cores had a permeability contrast between the fracture and the matrix ranging from 2500 to 90,000. Non-fractured corefloods were also performed and compared with the fractured corefloods. The more viscous surfactant solutions achieved greater oil recovery from the fractured carbonate cores. These results indicate that a viscous microemulsion can serve as a mobility control agent in naturally fractured reservoirs (NFRs) that is analogous to mobility control with foams and polymers, but with less complexity and cost.

                    "abstract": "Single-well-partitioning-tracer tests (SWTTs) are used to measure the saturation of oil or water near a wellbore. If used before and after injection of enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) fluids, they can evaluate EOR flood performance in a so-called one-spot pilot. Four alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) one-spot pilots were recently completed in Kuwait’s Sabriyah-Mauddud (SAMA) reservoir, a thick, heterogeneous carbonate operated by Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). UTCHEM (Delshad et al. 2013), the University of Texas chemical-flooding reservoir simulator, was used to interpret results of two of these one-spot pilots performed in an unconfined zone within the thick SAMA formation. These simulations were used to design a new method for injecting partitioning tracers for one-spot pilots. The recommended practice is to inject the tracers into a relatively uniform confined zone, but, as seen in this work, that is not always possible, so an alternative design was needed to improve the accuracy of the test. The simulations showed that there was a flow-conformance problem when the partitioning tracers were injected into a perforated zone without confinement after the viscous ASP and polymer-drive solutions. The water-conveyed-tracer solutions were being partially diverted outside of the ASP-swept zone where they contacted unswept oil. Because of this problem, the initial interpretation of the performance of the chemicals was pessimistic, overestimating the chemical residual oil saturation (ROS) by up to 12 saturation units. Additional simulations indicated that the oil saturation in the ASP-swept zone could be properly estimated by avoiding the post-ASP waterflood and injecting the post-ASP tracers in a viscous polymer solution rather than in water. An ASP one-spot pilot using the new SWTT design resulted in an estimated ROS of only 0.06 after injection of chemicals (Carlisle et al. 2014). These saturation values were obtained by history matching tracer-production data by use of both traditional continuously-stirred-tank (CSTR) models and compositional, reactive-transport reservoir models. The ability of the simulator to model every phase of the one-spot pilot operation was crucial to the insight of modified SWTT design. The waterflood, first SWTT, ASP flood, and the final SWTT were simulated using a heterogeneous permeability field representative of the Mauddud formation. Laboratory data, field-ASP quality-control information, and injection strategy were all accounted for in these simulations. We describe the models, how they were used, and how the results were used to modify the SWTT design. We further discuss the implications for other SWTTs. The advantage of mechanistic simulation of multiple aspects of a one-spot pilot is an important theme of this study. Because the pore space investigated by the SWTTs can be affected by the previously injected EOR fluids (and vice versa), these interactions should be accounted for. This simulation approach can be used to identify and mitigate design problems during each phase of a challenging one-spot pilot. "

The effectiveness of the ACP formulation was validated in a 1D sand pack by conducting a waterflood followed by a stable ACP flood. Sand was then packed into a 2D square steel cell equivalent to a quarter five-spot pattern. Several ACP floods were then conducted in this 2D cell to study both the displacement and sweep efficiency of ACP floods. First, the polymer concentration in the ACP formulation was varied to find an optimum ACP slug viscosity where the oil recovery and pressure gradients are acceptable. When the ACP slug viscosity was about 1/4 of the oil viscosity, oil recovery was 76% OOIP; we adopted this viscosity as the optimum viscosity. Then, using this ACP slug viscosity, the waterflood extent, after which the ACP flood was initiated, was varied (0-1 pore volume). The oil recovery, oil cut, effluent concentration and pressure drop were monitored during the floods. The timing of the tertiary flood did not change the tertiary oil recovery very much. However, shorter the waterflood, faster was the oil recovery under the constant injection rate constraint. Sweep efficiency during secondary ACP flood was lower than that in the tertiary ACP injection. Gravity effect on sweep was significant under ultralow IFT. "

The results show that one can perform gravity-stable surfactant floods at a reasonable velocity and with very-high sweep efficiencies for reservoirs with high vertical permeability. These simulations were carried out with a 3D fine grid and a third-order finite-difference method to accurately model fingering. A sensitivity study was conducted to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and well spacing. The simulations were performed with realistic surfactant properties on the basis of laboratory experiments. The critical velocity for a stable surfactant flood is a function of the microemulsion (ME) viscosity, and it turns out there is an optimum value that one can use to significantly increase the velocity and still be stable. One can optimize the salinity gradient to gradually change the ME viscosity. Another alternative is to inject a low-concentration polymer drive following the surfactant slug (without polymer). Polymer complicates the process and adds to its cost without a significant benefit in most gravity-stable surfactant floods, but an exception is when the reservoir is highly layered.

Moreover, other sets of corefloods were chosen to validate the proposed LSWI mechanistic model. The geochemical model in the UTCHEM simulator was modified to calculate the molar Gibbs free energy of the brine. In the proposed LSWI mechanistic model, the relative permeability curves, including the residual oil saturation (ROS), are functions of the molar Gibbs free energy. Coreflood experiments were simulated and history matched by use of the proposed model. The proposed LSWI mechanistic model was further extended to include weakly oil-wet to mixed-wet carbonate rocks. The mechanistic model captures the effects on oil recovery of both wettability alteration and/or dissolution/fines migration through changes in the molar Gibbs free energy.

Scientific understanding of how the molecular structures of surfactants and co-solvents affect microemulsion properties greatly speeds up the process of arriving at optimal formulations for enhanced recovery of a specific crude oil in a specific oil reservoir. With the main emphasis on reducing the chemical cost of the formulations, a new slate of novel chemicals, both surfactants and co-solvents, has been developed and shown to have superior performance. We have synthesized and tested new classes of surfactants with different hydrophobe sizes and structures varying from large-medium-short-ultrashort in order to meet the needs of a variety of crude oil requirements. We have also developed ultra-short hydrophobe surfactants (with 2-ethylhexanol hydrophobe) possessing dual surfactant / co-solvent properties. Such duality in performance helps, in some cases, to minimize or altogether offset the use of co-solvents while maintaining low microemulsion viscosities, faster equilibration, and other desirable behavior. Thus, 2-ethylhexanol-propoxy-sulfate was developed as a surfactant that also encompasses co-solvent properties. The novel Gemini surfactants have also been incorporated in formulations and core flood experiments with excellent results. The new co-solvents offer advantages such as short equilibration time for the microemulsion formation and lower microemulsion viscosity. Systematic studies using these new surfactants and co-solvents clearly show that we now have the capability of developing highly robust formulations to meet the needs of a variety of reservoirs, resulting in high oil recoveries with low surfactant retention, which is the key to lowering the chemical costs and improving the economics of chemical enhanced oil recovery.

                    "abstract": "Upscaling of unstable immiscible flow remains an unsolved challenge for the oil industry. The absence of a reliable upscaling approach greatly hinders the effective reservoir simulation and optimization of heavy oil recoveries using waterflood, polymer flood and other chemical floods, which are inherently unstable processes. The difficulty in upscaling unstable flow lies in estimating the propagation of fingers smaller than the gridblock size. Using classical relative permeabilities obtained from stable flow analysis can lead to incorrect oil recovery and pressure drop in reservoir simulations. In a recent study based on abundant experimental data, it is found that the heavy-oil recovery by waterfloods and polymer floods has a power-law correlation with a dimensionless number (named viscous finger number in this paper), which is a combination of viscosity ratio, capillary number, permeability, and the cross-section area of the core. Based upon this important finding as well as the features of unstable immiscible floods, an effective-finger model is developed in this paper. A porous medium domain is dynamically identified as three effective zones, which are two-phase flow zone, oil single-phase flow zone, and bypassed oil (isolated oil island) zone, respectively. Flow functions are derived according to effective flows in these zones. This new model is capable of history-matching a set of heavy-oil waterflood corefloods under different viscosity ratios and injection rates. Model parameters obtained from the history match also have a power-law correlation with the viscous finger number. The build-up of this correlation contains reasonable physical meanings to quantitatively characterize the upscaled behavior of viscous fingering effects. Having such a correlation enables the estimation of model parameters in any gridblock of the reservoir by knowing the local viscous finger number in reservoir simulations. The model is applied to several heavy-oil field cases with waterfloods and polymer floods with different heterogeneities. Oil recovery in water flooding of viscous oils is overpredicted by classical simulation methods which do not incorporate viscous fingering properly. Simulation results indicate that the new model reasonably differentiates the oil recoveries at different viscous finger numbers, e.g., lower injection rate leads to higher oil recovery. In contrast, classical simulations obtain close oil recoveries under different injection rates or degrees of polymer shear-thinning, which is apparently incorrect for unstable floods. Moreover, coarse-grid simulations using the new model are able to obtain consistent saturation and pressure maps with fine-grid simulations when the correlation lengths are not smaller than the coarse gridblock size. Furthermore, it is well captured by the model that the shear-shinning polymer solution can strengthen the fingering in high-permeability regions due to increased capillary number and viscosity ratio, which is not observed in waterflood. As a whole, the new model shows encouraging capability to simulate unstable water and polymer floods in heavy oil reservoirs, and hence can facilitate the optimization of heavy-oil EOR projects. "

Zeta potential measurements were performed to characterize Bandera brown sandstone and Silurian dolomite surfaces in the presence of ammonia and sodium carbonate. A series of experiments were performed with and without ammonia such as static surfactant adsorption experiments on crushed Bandera brown sandstone and Silurian dolomite rocks, single phase surfactant transport experiments in sandstone and carbonate cores, surfactant phase behavior to identify an ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) surfactant formulation, and oil recovery coreflood experiments using these surfactant formulations. Zeta potential measurements showed a reduction in zeta potential of Bandera brown and Silurian dolomite by adding ammonia to increase the pH. Surfactant adsorption experiments showed that ammonia was able to reduce the adsorption on sandstones, but not much difference was observed for carbonates. The ultra-low IFT surfactant formulations developed with and without ammonia showed very similar phase behavior. High oil recoveries and very low surfactant retentions were observed in the oil recovery experiments performed in sandstones. "

                    "abstract": "The chemical cost to recover an incremental barrel of oil is directly proportional to the surfactant retention, so the single most effective way to reduce the cost is to reduce surfactant retention. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate how surfactant retention could be reduced to almost zero by careful optimization of the chemical formulations for different crude oils. Although surfactant retention has been studied for many years over a wide range of reservoir conditions, its dependence on the rheological behavior of the microemulsion that forms in-situ has not been adequately studied. Thus, in this paper we emphasize the importance of microemulsion rheology and demonstrate how to develop and test formulations with properties that give very low surfactant retention. Novel co-solvents (iso-butanol (IBA) alkoxylates and phenol alkoxylates) were tested in some of the formulations with excellent results. Unlike classical co-solvents used to optimize chemical formulations, the new co-solvents cause only a slight increase in the interfacial tension. A series of ASP corefloods were performed in sandstone cores with and without oil to measure surfactant and co-solvent retention and to elucidate the effects of microemulsion viscosity, salinity gradient, clay content, surfactant concentration and other variables. Dynamic adsorption was measured in cores with the same mineralogy and compared with the retention from oil recovery corefloods to determine the component of the retention due to phase trapping. "

                    "abstract": "Primary and secondary oil recovery from naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs with an oil-wet matrix is very low. Enhanced oil recovery from these reservoirs using surfactants to alter the wettability and reduce the interfacial tension have been extensively studied for many years, but there are still many questions about the process mechanisms, surfactant selection and testing, experimental design and most importantly how to scale up the lab results to the field. We have conducted a series of imbibition experiments using cores with different vertical and horizontal dimensions to better understand how to scale up the process. There was a particular need to perform experiments with larger horizontal dimensions since almost all previous experiments have been done in cores with a small diameter, typically 3.8 cm. We adapted and modified the experimental method used for traditional static imbibition experiments by flushing out fluids surrounding the cores periodically to better estimate the oil recovery, including the significant amount of oil produced as an emulsion. We used microemulsion phase behavior tests to develop high performance surfactant formulations for the oils used in this study. These surfactants gave ultra-low IFT at optimum salinity and good aqueous stability. Although we used ultra-low IFT formulations for most of the experiments, we also performed tests at higher IFT for comparison. Even for the higher IFT experiments, the capillary pressure is very small compared to gravity and viscous pressure gradients. We also developed a simple analytical model to predict the oil recovery as a function of vertical and horizontal fracture spacing, rock properties and fluid properties. The model and experimental data are in good agreement considering the many simplifications made to derive the model. The scaling implied by the model is significantly different than traditional scaling groups in the literature. "

We measured the partitioning of co-solvents between phases to better understand their behavior and how to select the best co-solvent for chemical EOR. There is an optimal co-solvent partition coefficient for microemulsion systems. Commercial co-solvents used for chemical EOR are actually mixtures of different components. We used HPLC to measure the partitioning of the constitutive components of phenol ethoxylate co-solvents between oil and water phases and between microemulsion and excess oil and water phases. These measurements show that the components partition independently and the partitioning of individual components is often different from the average. The co-solvent partition coefficients between oil and water were systematically evaluated as functions of the number of ethylene oxide groups, number of propylene oxide groups, temperature, salinity, and the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of the oil. Novel alkoxylate co-solvents were also evaluated for chemical EOR. The novel alkoxylate co-solvents can be more effectively tailored to match the characteristics of different crude oils. Coreflood experiments were conducted to investigate co-solvent transport and retention. Co-solvents were identified that showed excellent performance and low retention. "

                    "abstract": "The Mangala field in the state of Rajasthan of western India was the first major oil discovery in the Barmer basin and is the largest discovered oil field in the basin. It contains paraffinic oil with average viscosity of ~15 cp and wax appearance temperature only about 5°C lower than reservoir temperature of 65°C. The initial development plan was a hot waterflood to prevent any in situ wax deposition; recently, though chemical EOR methods have started to play an important role in the development of the field. A polymer flood pilot was successfully conducted in the field. It was followed by an ASP pilot trial which used the same set of wells. Unlike the polymer pilot, ASP injection was confined to a single continuous sand to reduce interference with nearby wells and to reduce the uncertainty in interpretation of pilot results. A combination of a high molecular weight branched alcohol PO-EO sulfate and a high carbon number sulfonate was selected for the ASP formulation. The selected surfactants functioned well in the desired salinity range and were stable in an aqueous solution up to half a percent higher alkali concentration than the optimal concentration. The pilot facilities needed to meet a number of challenges arising from using neat surfactants-mainly handling of viscous/gelling material, maintaining accurate dosing rates, maintaining the right ratio of two surfactants, and maintaining stability of the sulfate itself. These challenges were surmounted in the pilot by using a blended surfactant solution, diluted with water, with activity of 24%. ASP injection led to mobilization of significant volume of oil in the confined 5-spot pattern. The oil-cut of the central producer increased from 10% to 80%. The oil production rate showed almost an eight fold increase from 50 bopd to nearly 400 bopd. The estimated incremental recovery over polymer flooding is nearly 20% of the pilot STOIIP. Later in the pilot project the expected increase in water-cut was accompanied with the production of the injected chemicals along with rise in the pH of the produced water, indicating that favourable mobility was maintained during ASP injection. Some production challenges were encountered—most notably the failure of the producer's electrical submersible pump (ESP); this required the producer to be put on jet pump intermittently when the ESP was not functioning. The saturation observation wells located within the pattern area showed significant desaturation of oil. Sponge cores acquired after the pilot showed very low remaining oil saturation in the flooded sections. The paper will discuss the pilot operations, monitoring and quality control, the pilot results, and lessons learnt. "

When the bottomhole pressure drops to less than the dewpoint, condensate forms in and around fractures and causes a significant drop in the gas relative permeability, which leads to a decline in the gas-production rate. This reduction of gas productivity is in addition to the reduction because of water blocking by the fracturing water. Solvents can be used to remove liquid blocks and increase gas- and condensate-production rates. In this paper, dimethyl ether (DME) is introduced as a novel solvent for this purpose. In addition to good partitioning into condensate/gas/aqueous phases, DME has a high vapor pressure, which improves the flowback after the treatment.

Because the results depend on many variables such as the initial oil saturation, rock characteristics and polymer characteristics, such experiments must be performed at reservoir conditions and at controlled capillary numbers and so forth to measure the reduction that applies to field polymer floods. Furthermore, a mechanistic model is needed to scale up the laboratory coreflood results to the field. We implemented and tested the new model for the residual oil saturation in a mechanistic numerical reservoir simulator. The simulation model was used to match the oil recovery and pressure drop of both secondary and tertiary polymer flood experiments.

The process is simulated by use of a model derived from existing laboratory and pilot data of a 5,000-cp heavy-oil field. It is found that hot waterflooding is efficient in heating the reservoir only when high early injectivity is achievable. This may not be the case if incipient fluid injectivity is low and/or long, continuous, horizontal shale baffles are present. To remedy the former, an electrical-preheating period is devised, whereas switching to a horizontal flood could overcome the latter. Once the reservoir temperature is raised sufficiently, a moderately unstable alkali/cosolvent/polymer flood is capable of mobilizing and displacing oil. A best combined strategy for efficient reservoir heating, high oil recovery, and cost effectiveness is found to involve reducing the oil viscosity to values of approximately 300-500 cp and combining a degree of mobility control and low interfacial tension as recovery mechanisms.

The standard experiment for testing imbibition of surfactant solution involves an imbibition cell, in which the core is placed in the surfactant solution and the recovery is measured vs. time. Although these experiments prove the effectiveness of surfactants, little insight into the physics of the problem is achieved. In this study, we performed water and surfactant flooding into oil-wet fractured cores and monitored the imbibition of the surfactant solution by use of computed-tomography (CT) scanning. From the CT images, the surfactant-imbibition dynamics as a function of height along the core was obtained. Although the waterflood only displaced oil from the fracture, the surfactant solution imbibed into the matrix; the imbibition is frontal, with the greatest imbibition rate at the bottom of the core, and the imbibition decreases roughly linearly with height. Experiments with cores of different sizes showed that increase in either the height or the diameter of the core causes decrease in imbibition and fractional oil-recovery rate. We also perform numerical simulations to model the observed imbibition. On the basis of the experimental measurements and numerical-simulation results, we propose a new scaling group that includes both the diameter and the height of the core. We show that the new scaling groups scale the recovery curves better than the traditional scaling group. "

The combined effect of LSWI and CO2 injection on oil recovery was predicted by performing several 1D simulations using measured reservoir rock and fluid data. These simulations included the effect of salinity on both miscible and immiscible continuous gas injection (CGI), simultaneous water-alternating-gas (SWAG), constant water-alternating-gas (WAG), and tapered (WAG). For SWAG and constant and tapered WAG, both seawater and its dilutions were simulated. CO2 was injected above its minimum miscibility pressure. Baker's three-phase relative permeability model was modified to account for the effect of salinity on the water/oil relative permeability. The results show that SWAG, whether using seawater or its dilutions, outperformed all other tertiary injection modes in terms of oil recovery. Moreover, the SWAG process has both the highest tertiary recovery factor (TRF) and the lowest utilization factor (UF). This study highlights the advantage of using low salinity water along with miscible CO2. The miscible CO2 displaces the residual oil saturation whereas the low salinity water boosts the production rate by increasing the oil relative permeability through wettability alteration towards more a water-wet state. The latter finding was supported by comparing our simulations with the two corefloods reported by Chandrasekhar and Mohanty (2014). These corefloods were conducted in SWAG tertiary mode using seawater and its dilutions. Fractional flow analysis shows that SWAG with low salinity water requires less injected solvent compared to SWAG with seawater and miscible CGI. "

The subject reservoir has been under pattern waterflooding for more than 10 years. Positive response with an increase in overall oil-rate was observed during the waterflooding period until recently several wells started water production with considerable increase in overall water-cut. High degree of heterogeneity and adverse mobility ratio were the key factors contributing to the fast water-cut increase, which reduces the waterflooding recovery efficiency. Pilot simulations of EOR recovery techniques such as miscible CO2, WAG and chemical EOR processes indicated significant potential in recovery efficiency over waterflooding for the reservoir. This paper presents methodologies in designing laboratory experimental and reservoir modeling studies of EOR processes and pilot simulation design for the selected EOR process in SAMA. One of the challenges in developing the simulation model for SAMA was to capture heterogeneity of the reservoir which impacts the fluid flow. In this paper, we show the importance of generating fine-grid model and calibrating the model with the historical production, pressure data, production logging tool (PLT) data, repeat formation test (RFT) pressure profiles, and tracer breakthrough data, to tackle the issue of capturing those details related to fluid flow behavior in the reservoir. Data necessary for studying the surfactant-polymer (SP) chemical EOR process were collected and the suitable surfactant(s) and polymer were identified through an extensive laboratory program, which were critical in designing a chemical formulation suitable for this high temperature and high salinity carbonate reservoir. The single well chemical tracer (SWCT) tests1 performed at SAMA indicated substantial reduction in the residual oil saturation by the chosen chemical formulation. The results of the SAMA SWCT tests were incorporated in the pilot simulation model. A field pilot program was recommended through pilot-scale simulations. A regular 5-spot pattern on approximately 5 acres is recommended in waterflooded area. The objectives of the field pilot are to 1) Identify the EOR process efficiency in terms of residual oil saturation reduction and sweep, 2) test injectivity and handling of injection and produced fluids, and 3) collect data for analyzing EOR process efficiency and for model calibration.

In this model, the changes in the oil relative permeability curve and residual oil saturation as a result of the LSWI effect are considered. The water relative permeability parameters are assumed constant, which is a relatively fair assumption on the basis of history matching of coreflood data. The capillary pressure is neglected because we assumed several capillary pressure curves in our simulations in which it had a negligible effect on the history-match results. The proposed model is implemented in the UTCHEM simulator, which is a 3D multiphase flow, transport, and chemical-flooding simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin (UTCHEM 2000), to match and predict the multiple cycles of low-salinity experiments. The screening criteria for using the proposed LSWI model are addressed in the paper.

A four-phase flow and transport formulation is needed to accurately model these EOR methods. New experimental data are now available to help in the development and validation of such models.

A black-oil model for water/oil/gas is coupled with the surfactant/oil/water (microemulsion) phase behavior model through a new formulation. The new formulation includes water, oil, gas, surfactant, polymer and electrolyte components in the aqueous, oleic, microemulsion and gas phases. The PVT properties are calculated for each phase using this model. The impact of pressure and solution gas on the optimum salinity and interfacial tension will be discussed. The four-phase flow simulator has been used to model low-tension gas flooding taking into account process mechanisms. The results aid in the understanding and interpretation of four-phase flow chemical EOR processes. The simulator can be used to evaluate chemical EOR methods involving solution gas and/or free gas, to scale up lab experiments to the field and to optimize chemical EOR process design for field tests among other applications. The need for a reliable mechanistic simulator has greatly increased due to more field applications of chemical EOR with gas and the expected further increase of this type of EOR. "

This work describes a new methodology to select a CEOR strategy in a heavy oil reservoir when several viable options exist. We applied this methodology to the Pelican Lake field in Alberta. We evaluated water flooding, polymer flooding, alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding, alkaline-co-solvent-polymer (ACP) flooding and polymer flooding followed by ASP flooding in laboratory tests. We executed new experiments including microemulsion phase behavior, polymer rheology and corefloods representing these various strategies. These experiments were designed to help understand the role of mobility control in chemical flooding of heavy oils. UTCHEM, the University of Texas Chemical Flooding Simulator, was used to model experimental results, and to scale them up in pilot simulations using heterogeneous geological models representative of Pelican Lake. We report results for the selection of promising CEOR strategies for implementation in Pelican Lake based on the new laboratory experiments, reservoir simulations and our qualitative understanding of their various advantages and disadvantages. We present simulation results of a pilot using horizontal wells in a heterogeneous geological model representative of the reservoir. We simulated the various chemical EOR processes using the matched experimental data and evaluated them in terms of total oil production, time to completion and complexity. In-situ oil viscosity and operational injection limits were evaluated as crucial sensitivities. We make recommendations for CEOR implementation based on simulation study results and our understanding of relative process risks and costs. "

The purpose of this study was to develop a method to predict the stability of surfactant floods at the reservoir scale on the basis of gravity-stable surfactant-flooding experiments at the laboratory scale. The scaleup process involves calculation of the appropriate average frontal velocity for the reservoir flood. The frontal velocity depends on the well configuration. We have performed systematic numerical simulations to study the effect of key scaling groups on the performance of gravity-stable surfactant floods. We simulated 3D heterogeneous reservoirs by use of a fine grid and a third-order finite-difference method to ensure numerical accuracy. These simulations have provided new insight into the behavior of gravity-stable surfactant floods, and in particular the importance of the microemulsion properties. The capability to predict when and under what reservoir conditions a gravity-stable surfactant flood can be performed at a reasonable velocity is highly significant. When a surfactant flood can be performed without polymer (or foam) for mobility control, cost and complexity are significantly reduced. Advantages are especially significant when the reservoir temperature is high and the use of polymer becomes increasingly difficult. Our simulations show that gravity-stable surfactant floods can be very efficient using horizontal wells in reservoirs with high vertical permeability. "

The microemulsion viscosity is sensitive to formulation variables such as the amount and type of co-solvent added to the surfactant solution. By changing surfactant components, cosolvents, and the concentration of the co-solvents, we were able to successfully control the microemulsion viscosity at optimum salinity in order to optimize the critical velocities in each surfactant flood.

Preliminary investigations demonstrate that the amount of produced energy by extracted methane exceeds the energy required for pressurization of CO2 and extracted brine to be injected into the same aquifer. In case of brine temperatures of higher than 150 °C, geothermal energy from the produced hot brine can be used in amine scrubbing process to capture CO2 from flue gas. The amount of thermal energy from hot brine exceeds the amount of energy required for amine scrubbing.

The effect of LSWI on the oil recovery from carbonate formations has been well documented in the laboratory and to a limited extent in the field. In this paper, a mechanistic geochemical model is proposed that addresses the effect on oil recovery of different geochemical reactions resulting from LSWI. The proposed model was used to history match recently published corefloods using the UTCHEM mechanistic reservoir simulator. Moreover, other sets of corefloods were chosen to validate the proposed LSWI mechanistic model. The geochemical model in the UTCHEM simulator was modified to calculate the molar Gibbs free energy of the brine. In the proposed LSWI mechanistic model, the relative permeability curves including the residual oil saturation are functions of the molar Gibbs free energy. Coreflood experiments were simulated and history matched using the proposed model. The proposed LSWI mechanistic model was further extended to include weakly-oil-wet to mixed-wet carbonate rocks. The mechanistic model captures the effects on oil recovery of both wettability alteration and/or dissolution/fine migration through changes in the molar Gibbs free energy. This model can now be used for oil recovery predictions and optimization of LSWI field applications. "

A four-phase flow and transport formulation is needed to accurately model these EOR methods. New experimental data are now available to help in the development and validation of such models.

We propose new three-phase relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models applicable to different fluid configurations in a porous medium under different wettability conditions. The relative permeability model includes both the saturation history and compositional effects. Three-phase parameters are estimated on the basis of saturation-weighted interpolation of two-phase parameters. The hysteresis model is an extension of the Land trapping model (Land 1968) but with a dynamic Land coefficient introduced. The trapping model estimates a constantly increasing trapped saturation for intermediate-wetting and nonwetting phases. The hysteresis model overcomes some of the limitations of existing three-phase hysteresis models for nonwater-wet rocks and mitigates the complexity associated with commonly applied models in numerical simulators. The relative permeability model is validated by use of multicycle three-phase water-alternating-gas experimental data for nonwater-wet rocks. Numerical simulations of a carbonate reservoir with and without hysteresis were used to assess the effect of the saturation direction and saturation path on gas entrapment and oil recovery. "

Sodium metaborate (NaBO2) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) were investigated as possible alternatives to Na2CO3. Batch mixing experiments were performed with these alkalis in the presence of excess gypsum, single phase brine-alkali transport experiments were performed in sandstone and carbonate cores containing gypsum, and ASP corefloods were performed in outcrop and reservoirs cores (containing gypsum). Effluent pH and ion concentrations including boron, calcium and sulfate were measured using an ion chromatograph (IC) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP). NaBO2 and NH4OH were found to maintain and propagate a high pH of more than 10 in the batch and transport experiments without significant permeability changes. Gypsum dissolution was not increased by NH4OH (over that of the brine itself) in batch or transport experiments. It, however, increased during NaBO2 injection depending on the flow rate.

Naturally fractured reservoirs are challenging targets for chemical flooding because they typically have a high permeability contrast between the fractures and the matrix with a low matrix permeability. Some of the world׳s largest oil reservoirs are fractured carbonates with a high reservoir temperature and a high salinity formation brine. Some of them also have low API gravity oils, which also increases the difficulty of recovering the oil. A surfactant formulation has been developed that shows promising results for such difficult reservoirs. Ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) and good aqueous stability were achieved with this new carboxylate surfactant in a hard brine at a high reservoir temperature of 100 °C. Both static and dynamic imbibition experiments were conducted using a fractured carbonate core. 65.9% Oil recovery was obtained in fractured coreflood compared to 33.3% oil recovery in static imbibition test. The surfactant retention was low at 0.086 mg/g of rock. The oil recovery is excellent taking into account that the temperature and salinity conditions were harsh, the core was extremely vuggy and fractured, no mobility control was used, and only a small surfactant slug was injected. The coreflood results were interpreted using a mechanistic chemical reservoir simulator. It showed that both the mechanisms of IFT reduction and wettability alteration were important for oil recovery. Neither IFT reduction nor wettability alteration alone recovered oil as high as the combined contributions from both. "

Many reservoirs, especially carbonates, contain gypsum or anhydrite. In such cases, a conventional alkali like sodium carbonate cannot be used in ASP formulations because it precipitates as calcite.  However, it was found that the calcium concentration in the presence of gypsum can be as high as 2000 ppm without causing any precipitation when ammonia is used as the alkali.   Ultralow IFT surfactant formulations were obtained in the presence of up to 1200 ppm Ca2+. Propagation of high pH, good oil recovery and low surfactant retention were observed in an ASP coreflood performed in a carbonate core containing gypsum. The Phreeqc geochemical simulator was used for reactive transport modeling and was found to be an effective tool for designing these corefloods.  A good match was observed between the measured concentration of the effluent ions from a coreflood experiment and the Phreeqc simulations. Introduction After primary and secondary recovery in oil reservoirs, a large amount of residual oil is unrecovered due to trapping in the pores of the reservoir rock by capillary forces. Surfactants are able to mobilize this trapped oil by lowering the interfacial tension.  Surfactants are retained in the reservoir by various mechanisms such as adsorption on mineral surfaces and phase trapping (Solairaj et al., 2012). Since a limited amount of surfactant can be used for an economical flood, the surfactant retention needs to be minimized. One of the ways of doing this is by incorporating an alkali into the surfactant formulation to increase the pH, which reduces the adsorption of anionic surfactants by making the surface charge negative (Somasundaran, 1979; Hirasaki et al., 2008). Alkali also helps in minimizing the amount of surfactant needed for oils that contain organic acids by generating soap. Many carbonate reservoirs contain either gypsum or anhydrite. Levitt et al. (2011) discuss various challenges encountered in the application of chemical EOR in carbonate reservoirs, especially in the presence of gypsum. Gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) or anhydrite (CaSO4) differ in the water of hydration. The transition from gypsum to anhydrite takes place around 45 °C. Gypsum (or anhydrite depending on the temperature, but for convenience we refer to gypsum unless we are describing a specific instance of anhydrite) is commonly present in carbonate reservoirs, especially dolomite formations as well as some sandstones, but it is less common in sandstone reservoirs. Under these circumstances, a conventional alkali such as sodium carbonate cannot be used because of precipitation of calcite by the reaction, "

This theory was tested for surfactant floods with ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) and was found to be optimistic compared with both laboratory displacement experiments and fine-grid simulations. The inaccurate prediction of instabilities on the basis of available analytical models is because of the complex physics of surfactant floods. First, we simulated vertical sandpack experiments to validate the numerical model. Then, we performed systematic numerical simulations in two and three dimensions to predict formation of instabilities in surfactant floods and to determine the velocity required to prevent instabilities by taking advantage of buoyancy. The 3D numerical grid was refined until the numerical results converged. A third-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) finite-difference method was used for these simulations. We investigated the effects of dispersion, heterogeneity, oil viscosity, relative permeability, and microemulsion viscosity. These results indicate that it is possible to design a very efficient surfactant flood without any mobility control if the surfactant solution is injected at a low velocity in horizontal wells at the bottom of the geological zone and the oil is captured in horizontal wells at the top of the zone. This approach is practical only if the vertical permeability of the geological zone is high. These experiments and simulations have provided new insight into how a gravity-stable, low-tension displacement behaves and in particular the importance of the microemulsion phase and its properties, especially its viscosity. Numerical simulations show high oil-recovery efficiencies on the order of 60% of waterflood residual oil saturation (ROS) for gravity-stable surfactant floods by use of horizontal wells. Thus, under favorable reservoir conditions, gravity-stable surfactant floods are very attractive alternatives to surfactant/polymer floods. Some of the world’s largest oil reservoirs are deep, high-temperature, high-permeability, light-oil reservoirs, and thus candidates for gravity-stable surfactant floods. "

                    "abstract": "Hydrocarbon-bearing tight rocks usually have pores at nanometer scale and permeability below microdarcy range. An effective characterization of the pore structure is essential for understanding hydrocarbon storage and transport behaviors. Nitrogen sorption isotherms measured at 77 K have been widely used for pore size and surface area characterization of nanoporous media. However, most analysis efforts are based on the assumption of slit or cylindrical pore shapes. Unconventional rocks such as shale have complex pore geometries that can have a significant effect on the adsorption curve cumulative behavior. Thus, a proper understanding of the effect of the assumed pore shapes on the interpretation of pore structure from nitrogen sorption isotherms is required to assess the reliability of the analysis results. In this study, we apply the lattice density functional theory initially developed for a single pore to a network of pores with bimodal pore size distribution and three types of pore shapes (i.e. slit, cylindrical and spherical). We simulate the nitrogen adsorption and desorption processes with incorporation of pore blocking effect and tensile strength effect. We optimize the pore size distribution, connectivity, surface area and surface energy for each type of pore shape by matching simulation and experimental sorption curves. We apply the above workflow to the sorption curves collected on Cameo coal and Woodford shale samples. For both samples, a network of spherical pores always results in the largest average pore size, highest surface energy, highest degree of connectivity but smallest surface area, while a network of slit pores shows the opposite. At the same time, all three types of pore shapes demonstrate a good match with experimental sorption curves. In terms of providing the closest match of surface area with BET results, we determine the dominant pore shape of Cameo coal and Woodford shale samples to be slit and cylindrical, respectively. To reduce the uncertainty in the characterization results, we further use a combination of all three types of pore shapes in our pore network model, with fractions of each pore shape determined by SEM image analysis. The final matching results show significant improvement over using only slit pore shape. "

                    "abstract": "Microseismic events suggest that a complicated fracture network develops during hydraulic fracturing treatment in many naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs. One reason for the complexity is the deformation along weak planes such as faults and cemented natural fractures. The interaction of cemented natural fractures with hydraulic fractures generated as part of reservoir stimulation may impede or terminate hydraulic fracture propagation, which depends on several factors such as interfacial bond strength between the cemented natural fractures and the reservoir rock. Most previous studies treat natural fractures as interfaces without considering their thickness. In this study, the semi−circular bend (SCB) tests for specimens with heterogeneity are used to study the fracture−fracture interactions, because the tensile fracture in the SCB test is analogous to the induced hydraulic fracture. With simple experimental setup and good repeatability, the SCB test results provide insights into real hydraulic fracture propagation behavior in naturally fractured reservoirs. We analyze the effects of natural fracture thickness and rock−cement interfacial bond strength, which are not commonly considered. Results show that hydraulic fracture crossing/diverting behavior depends on the approach angle, the rock−cement interfacial bond strength, and the thickness of natural fracture. Results also imply that as hydraulic fractures approach cemented natural fractures, the hydraulic fracture near‒tip stress state is influenced by the tensile and shear strength of the rock−cement interface. In the SCB test, the sample geometry induces shearing along the cemented natural fracture−rock interface, analogous to a frictionally slipping interface in the subsurface. Depending on the frictional strength and the approach angle, the interface may crack apart, and attract a propagating fracture. "

                    "abstract": "Understanding of pore-scale physics for multiphase flow in porous media is essential for accurate description of various flow phenomena. In particular, capillarity and wettability strongly influence capillary pressure-saturation and relative permeability relationships. Wettability is quantified by the contact angle of the fluid-fluid interface at the pore walls. In this work we focus on the non-trivial interface equilibria in presence of non-neutral wetting and complex geometries. We quantify the accuracy of a volume-of-fluid (VOF) formulation, implemented in a popular open-source computational fluid dynamics code, compared with a new formulation of a level set (LS) method, specifically developed for quasi-static capillarity-dominated displacement. The methods are tested in rhomboidal packings of spheres for a range of contact angles and for different rhomboidal configurations and the accuracy is evaluated against the semi-analytical solutions obtained by Mason and Morrow (1994). While the VOF method is implemented in a general purpose code that solves the full Navier-Stokes (NS) dynamics in a finite volume formulation, with additional terms to model surface tension, the LS method is optimized for the quasi-static case and, therefore, less computationally expensive. To overcome the shortcomings of the finite volume NS-VOF system for low capillary number flows, and its computational cost, we introduce an overdamped dynamics and a local time stepping to speed up the convergence to the steady state, for every given imposed pressure gradient (and therefore saturation condition). Despite these modifications, the methods fundamentally differ in the way they capture the interface, as well as in the number of equations solved and in the way the mean curvature (or equivalently capillary pressure) is computed. This study is intended to provide a rigorous validation study and gives important indications on the errors committed by these methods in solving more complex geometry and dynamics, where usually many sources of errors are interplaying.

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of solid particles (fines) into a reservoir during drilling or water reinjection is a long-standing problem in the petroleum industry because of the associated production decline or injectivity loss. Solid particle infiltration is also an active area of research in other fields such as waste water treatment and fines migration in clay-rich reservoirs. In this work, we perform experiments to study particle infiltration into sintered glass bead core plugs and measure the changes in porosity and permeability using computed tomography (CT) scanning and pressure transducers, respectively. Suspensions of prescribed bimodal particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs. Permeability changes are measured continuously over time, and the porosity change is measured after flowing a fixed mass of invaded particles. A dual pore-scale numerical model approach (a combination of a direct pore-scale discrete element method (DEM) and a pore-scale network model) is used to predict permeability reduction by particle filtration in porous media. Large particle deposition is modeled using the DEM in a disordered sphere pack geometry; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of large particle concentration. Small particle deposition is modeled using the network model; the result is a prediction of deposition as a function of small particle concentration. Crucially, the geometry of the network model depends on the amount of large particles deposited. In this way, the deposition of large and small sized particles is coupled together. The permeability and porosity reduction of the network due to the deposition of small and large particles are then calculated from the functions above. We compare the experimental results with simulation predictions and find that the dual pore-scale model is capable of predicting the permeability of the invaded core in the regions away from the injection face. Permeability prediction in the region adjacent to the injection face is improved by incorporating the influence of the external filter cake. "

                    "abstract": "Ultralow water content carbon dioxide-in-water (C/W) foams with gas phase volume fractions (ϕ) above 0.95 (that is <0.05 water) tend to be inherently unstable given that the large capillary pressures that cause the lamellar films to thin. Herein, we demonstrate that these C/W foams may be stabilized with viscoelastic aqueous phases formed with a single zwitterionic surfactant at a concentration of only 1% (w/v) in DI water and over a wide range of salinity. Moreover, they are stable with a foam quality ϕ up to 0.98 even for temperatures up to 120 °C. The properties of aqueous viscoelastic solutions and foams containing these solutions are examined for a series of zwitterionic amidopropylcarbobetaines, R-ONHC3H6N(CH3)2CH2CO2, where R is varied from C12–14 (coco) to C18 (oleyl) to C22 (erucyl). For the surfactants with long C18 and C22 tails, the relaxation times from complex rheology indicate the presence of viscoelastic wormlike micelles over a wide range in salinity and pH, given the high surfactant packing fraction. The apparent viscosities of these ultralow water content foams reached more than 120 cP with stabilities more than 30-fold over those for foams formed with the non-viscoelastic C12–14 surfactant. At 90 °C, the foam morphology was composed of ∼35 μm diameter bubbles with a polyhedral texture. The apparent foam viscosity typically increased with ϕ and then dropped at ϕ values higher than 0.95–0.98. The Ostwald ripening rate was slower for foams with viscoelastic versus non-viscoelastic lamellae as shown by optical microscopy, as a consequence of slower lamellar drainage rates. The ability to achieve high stabilities for ultralow water content C/W foams over a wide temperature range is of interest in various technologies including polymer and materials science, CO2 enhanced oil recovery, CO2 sequestration (by greater control of the CO2 flow patterns), and possibly even hydraulic fracturing with minimal use of water to reduce the requirements for wastewater disposal.

This makes them greatly appealing for hydraulic fracturing applications, where minimal water consumption and leak-off to the reservoir are desired. Initial assessment of propensities of these novel fluids for fracturing applications requires field scale simulations. However, conventional fracturing models are difficult to employ because they do not consider true foam hydrodynamics. We have developed a mathematical model to simulate the transport of NP-stabilized foams for hydraulic fracturing. The model combines fluid transport in reservoir matrix and fracture with rock mechanics equations and thus allows for considering the effects of foam on fracture dynamics. Gas and water flow with mechanistic accounting of foam generation and coalescence are simulated using population balance models. Transport of nanoparticles through porous media was simulated using single site filtration model. The equations are discretized using finite-difference scheme. Settari’s approach is used to embed fracture’s moving boundary with the matrix to accordingly update transmissibility. Model’s capabilities are verified with examples on fracture growth and fracture clean up processes to illustrate the benefits of using the NP-stabilized high quality foams. Fracture propagation was simulated for water, a conventional viscous fracpad and NP-stabilized foams of different qualities and textures. The simulations confirmed that larger foam viscosity generated wider fractures with smaller fracture half-length. In addition, fracture cleanup simulations show that fracturing fluid cleanup for foam based fracturing fluids could take the order of 10 days as opposed to that of viscous fracpad which could take up to 1000 days; demonstrating the advantage of using dry foams.

Finite difference formulation leads to fast parallel implementation through linear solvers for sparse matrices, allowing relatively fast simulations, while regularization techniques used on solving inverse problems lead to the desired incompressible fluid flow. Tests performed using benchmark samples show good agreement with experimental/theoretical values. Additional tests are run on Bentheimer and Buff Berea sandstone samples with available laboratory measurements. We compare the results from our new method, based on finite differences, with an open source finite volume implementation as well as experimental results, specifically to evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of each method.

In fracturing applications, it would be desirable to lower the water level as much as possible to minimize the production of wastewater and formation damage. It is challenging to stabilize ultra dry foams with extremely high internal phase gas fraction given the high capillary pressure and the rapid drainage rate of the lamellae between the gas bubbles. However, we demonstrate that these ultra dry CO2-in-water foams may be stabilized with surfactants that form viscoelastic wormlike micelles in the aqueous phase. These wormlike micelles are formed by tuning the surfactant packing parameter with electrolytes or a second oppositely-charged surfactant to stabilize ultradry CO2-in-water foams with foam qualities as high as 0.98 and apparent viscosities more than 100 cP up to 90 °C. Applicability of these foams for improved oil recovery is evaluated by running multiphase flow injection simulations in a case-study oil reservoir. "

Flow of supercritical gas in these pores at reservoir pressure–temperature conditions falls within the slip-flow and early transition-flow regime (0.001 < Kn < 1.0). Currently, the description of supercritical gas flow in these flow regimes is mostly limited to simple tube and channel geometries that are of limited applicability to the sponge-like or platy nanoporous geometry in organic matter or clays. Here, we present a local-effective-viscosity multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model (LEV-LBM) designed to simulate gas flow in the slip- and early-transition-flow regimes in complex geometries. The LEV-LBM is informed with local effective viscosities at each node to capture the variance of the mean free path of gas molecules in a bounded system. The corrected mean free path for each lattice node is determined using a three-dimensional wall function adaptable to complex pore geometries. To enforce a non-zero slip velocity at solid boundaries, a combined diffusive bounce-back scheme is applied to the pore-walls. The LEV-LBM is first validated in simple tube geometries, where good agreement is found for Knudsen numbers up to 1.0. We then use the LEV-LBM to quantify the finite tube length effect and comment on the implications for pore-network models. We finally demonstrate the utility of the LEV-LBM by simulating pure methane flow in digital reconstructions of nanoporous organic matter at reservoir conditions, and compare the results to bundle of tubes models. We show that the bundle of tubes models overestimate apparent permeability by factors between 1.52 and 153, due to the non-trivial dependence of flow on pore space connectivity and shape. "

Here, we propose a methodology that combines two different pore-scale models to better quantify formation damage. Further we validate the proposed model with core flood experiments. We first perform an experimental study of suspension flow into sintered glass bead plugs and measure changes in porosity and permeability. Specifically, glass bead suspensions of known mono- and poly- disperse combinations of particle sizes, concentrations, and flowrates are flooded through the core plugs, while keeping the total invaded particle volume constant. The resulting changes in porosity and permeability are quantified using a CT scanner and pressure transducers, respectively. We then establish two different numerical models (each focusing on a different mechanism/length scale) to predict permeability reduction. The first model takes a pore-scale approach that models straining of larger particles through the pore structures extracted from X-ray tomographic images of rock and grain pack samples from first principles. The detailed pore structure output from the first model is used as an input in the second model, which is a network model. This pore network model simulates permeability impairment caused by both large and small particles deposition in porous media. Forces exerted on small particles include hydraulic drag, gravity, buoyancy, electric double layer, and Van der Waals. Particle trajectories in a converging- diverging pore throat are calculated dynamically. We incorporate surface roughness and particle-surface interaction to determine particle detachment and attachment. Pore throat structure and hydraulic conductivities are updated dynamically to account for the effect of previously deposited particles. We finally compared the experimental results to simulation predictions and found that the combined pore- scale model is capable of predicting the porosity of the invaded core only in the deeper regions of the core.

                    "abstract": "Textural characterization is a critical step to assess and evaluate petrophysical properties of unconventional reservoirs, including shale-gas, coalbed and tight-gas systems. Gas adsorption, typically with N2 at 77 K or CO2 at 273 K, is the widely used method for such characterizations. To translate adsorption data into useful petrophysical quantities such as pore size, pore connectivity, and pore volume, one needs to exploit appropriate correlations to link molecular scale interactions and macro-scale phenomena. One important yet under-studied property of unconventional matrices is their true pore structure and its effects on fluid thermodynamics inside pore space. Herein, based on lattice density functional theory, we have developed a multilayer adsorption model with parameterized energy terms, to determine effects of pore shape and pore size (of shale and coal samples) on the thermodynamic state of reservoir fluid. The model is extended from its original slit pore geometry into cylindrical and spherical geometries to consider the effects of local pore curvature on adsorption energetics and uptakes mainly in mesopores (between 2 and 50 nm). In addition, the surface energy term is modified to consider the effect of the force field exerted by pore walls on both the adlayer and subsequent adsorbed layers. Modification of the energy term resulted in layer-by-layer, two-dimensional condensation followed by the final capillary condensation. The force field exerted by the pore walls together with local pore curvature shifted the condensation pressures toward lower relative pressures (P/P0). By applying the model to N2 porosimetry isotherms at 77 K for two reference samples, ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC), the model confirmed essentially cylindrical pore structure for both samples. The model was further applied to N2 at 77 K porosimetry isotherms of Woodford shale and Cameo coal samples, and identified the pore structures of the samples as dominated by cylindrical and slit pore geometries, respectively.

The viscosities and stabilities of foams up to 0.98 CO2 volume fraction were investigated in terms of foam bubble size, interfacial tension, and bulk and surface viscosity. The foams were stabilized with laurylamidopropyl betaine (LAPB) surfactant and silica nanoparticles (NPs), with and without partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). For foams stabilized with mixture of LAPB and NPs, fine ∼70 μm bubbles and high viscosities on the order of 100 cP at >0.90 internal phase fraction were stabilized for hours to days. The surfactant reduces interfacial tension, and thus facilitates bubble generation and decreases the capillary pressure to reduce the drainage rate of the lamella. The LAPB, which is in the cationic protonated form, also attracts anionic NPs (and anionic HPAM in systems containing polymer) to the interface. The adsorbed NPs at the interface are shown to slow down Ostwald ripening (with or without polymer added) and increase foam stability. In systems with added HPAM, the increase in the bulk and surface viscosity of the aqueous phase further decreases the lamella drainage rate and inhibits coalescence of foams. Thus, the added polymer increases the foam viscosity by threefold. Scaling law analysis shows the viscosity of 0.90 volume fraction foams is inversely proportional to the bubble size. "

While continuum models are widely used for fast prediction of the retention profiles and permeability of the host porous medium, they require a number of phenomenological parameters which are derived from matching experimental results. One of these parameters is the rate of entrapment, which is the sink term in the advection–diffusion equation. Here we find the constitutive relationship for the rate of entrapment as a product of the filtration coefficient, velocity, and concentration and validate it by comparing with core flood experiments. Results show that the pore-scale simulation gives close approximations of filtration coefficient when pore bridging and straining are the main particle capture mechanisms. "

In these materials, pore geometry evolves to minimize the solid–liquid interfacial energy while maintaining a constant dihedral angle, θ, at solid–liquid contact lines. We present a level set method to compute an implicit representation of the liquid–solid interface in textural equilibrium with space-filling tessellations of multiple solid grains in three dimensions. Each grain is represented by a separate level set function and interfacial energy minimization is achieved by evolving the solid–liquid interface under surface diffusion to constant mean curvature surface. The liquid volume and dihedral angle constraints are added to the formulation using virtual convective and normal velocity terms. This results in an initial value problem for a system of non-linear coupled PDEs governing the evolution of the level sets for each grain, using the implicit representation of the solid grains as initial condition. A domain decomposition scheme is devised to restrict the computational domain of each grain to few grid points around the grain. The coupling between the interfaces is achieved in a higher level on the original computational domain. The spatial resolution of the discretization is improved through high-order spatial differentiation schemes and localization of computations through domain composition. Examples of three-dimensional solutions are also obtained for different grain distributions networks that illustrate the geometric flexibility of the method. "

By considering two surface energy terms, the model distinguishes methane adsorption in the intrinsic micropore volume of the organic matter from that of the inorganic structure. One energy term describes methane adsorption in micropores (< 2 nm) whereas the other one concerns with meso-macropores. This study showed that at storage conditions, 150 bar and 50.4 °C, where methane is in supercritical state, the surface energy plays the major role to influence methane adsorption capacity whereas the effect of lateral forces between adsorbed molecules has a minor influence on overall adsorption capacity. We applied the model on experimental methane adsorption data in three organic-rich samples including Woodford shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo coal to quantify their methane storage state. Textural properties of shale and coal samples were analyzed by N2 porosimetry at − 196 °C. The samples had a weak micropore peak followed by a broader peak stretched over meso and macropore regions up to nearly 120 nm. Fitting the dual-site model to experimental methane adsorption data revealed that, among all, the coal sample, with the average heat of adsorption of 24.5 kJ/mol, had the highest interaction energies with both micro- and mesopore sites. Further, we find that 37%, 81% and 83% of methane was stored in the organic matter of Woodford shale, Woodford isolated kerogen and Cameo coal, respectively. Considering low maturity, and hence low micropore volume of the samples, and based on significant methane storage in the organic content we estimated that more than 50% of methane gas is being dissolved into the organic matter rather than just being adsorbed into the micropore volume.

Pore size and pore connectivity are important parameters in that they have first order impact on macroscopic flow properties of a porous medium. However, given the significant difficulty in capturing multiscale pores within a single three-dimensional image, and the possible uncertainties in the existence or absence of original throats in an acquired image, it is imperative to explore indirect methods to quantify the pore structure. In this paper, we simulate sorption in heterogeneous pore network models and study sorption and permeability hysteresis analyses as indirect methods for rock characterization. Three network types are introduced to represent the multiscale pore topology of shale rocks; specifically: regular (type 1), series (type 2) and parallel (type 3). We conclude that, in appropriate size ranges, sorption hysteresis can distinguish the three types whereas permeability hysteresis can only separate parallel from series and regular. Furthermore, the simulations show that sorption hysteresis is sensitive to compaction/cementation (closing of throats) in all network types whereas permeability hysteresis is sensitive to the diagenesis in parallel networks only.

The easily controllable magnetization of ferrofluids has motivated their use in a broad range of applications, from bioengineering to sealing of bearings. Recently, it was verified that nanoparticles with specifically-designed coating can be injected into reservoirs without significantly compromising permeability and with little retention. This suggests a potential for ferrofluid applications in EOR. We investigate this potential numerically through a method which, for a given external magnetic field, provides the equilibrium configuration of an oleic phase inside some pore geometry in the presence of dispersed excitable nanoparticles in surrounding brine. We adapted an existing level-set-based method for fluid-fluid displacement to include magnetic forces exerted on the fluid interface. Level set functions can easily accommodate complex shapes by representing the fluid-solid and fluid-fluid interfaces implicitly. The magnetic pressures depend locally on the magnetic field intensity and direction which in turn depend on the fluid configuration. Interfaces represent magnetic permeability discontinuities and hence cause disturbances in the spatial distribution of the field. The magnetic field solver handles these discontinuities through an immersed interface method. The numerical method developed sheds light on the effect of magnetization-induced stresses on the fluid phase distribution at a pore-scale. In particular, it shows how the magnetic pressure generated by the magnetization of the wetting phase helps displacing ganglia of non-wetting oil and thus reducing residual saturation. Results indicate that, aside from its straightforward dependency on the ferrofluid susceptibility, magnetic pressures are strongly influenced by the pore geometry. Stresses are amplified near the contacts between a ganglion and the pore wall by a factor up to two. The oil ganglia tend to adjust to the stress configuration by detaching from the wall. The stresses produced by the magnetization of ferrofluids could help to overcome strong capillary pressures and displace oil ganglia. A synergy of existing EOR methods (e.g. surfactant injection) and ferrofluids excited by a magnetic field has a potential to mobilize more trapped oil near wellbore. Our approach evaluates and quantifies this potential in realistic reservoir pores. "

We construct pore-throat networks that incorporate both intergranular porosity and microporosity. The latter originates from two separate mechanisms: partial dissolution of grains and pore fillings (e.g. clay). We then use the reconstructed network models to estimate the medium flow properties. In this work, we develop unique network construction algorithms and simulate capillary pressure–saturation and relative permeability–saturation curves for cases with inhomogeneous distributions of pores and micropores. Furthermore, we provide a modeling framework for variable amounts of cement and connectivity of the intergranular porosity and quantifying the conditions under which microporosity dominates transport properties. In the extreme case of a disconnected inter-granular network due to cementation a range of saturations within which neither fluid phase is capable of flowing emerges. To our knowledge, this is the first flexible pore scale model, from first principles, to successfully approach this behavior observed in tight reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "The infiltration of drilling mud below the bit and into the wellbore wall causes pressure gradients that significantly degrade drilling performance, wellbore stability and production. Due to heterogeneity, standard constitutive relationships and models yield poor predictions for flow (e.g. permeability) and rock properties (e.g. elastic moduli) of the invaded (damaged) formations. This severely reduces our ability to, for instance, estimate pressure build-up, optimize the mud cake properties or predict rock mechanical behavior. We propose a numerical model for permeability estimation in damaged formations near wellbore (e.g. sediments invaded by fines or sand crushing remnants). Grains of two length scales are present, but only larger ones are load-bearing. Detailed cemented granular packs were modeled using a discrete element method software, and ensuring mechanical stability. The particle positions and arrangement were available for subsequent pore throat network analysis. The standard network modeling approach for analysis of packing of nearly equal grains (Delaunay tessellation) cannot be used since grains of two different length scales create a high fraction of distorted pores. The main novelty of this work is adapting the network flow model to work with two length scales, and we present both the network creation and flow model in the multi-scale case. The effects of particle size and initial formation porosity on formation damage are studied in detail. Our study confirms that large particles tend to occupy the formation face, while small particles invade deep into the formation. Moreover, particles which are smaller than pore throats (entrances) impair permeability more than those larger than pore throats. Our study also indicates that a higher initial formation porosity leads to more particle invasion and permeability impairment. Thus in order to reduce formation damage, mud particle size distributions should be carefully selected according to given formation properties. "

A limitation of object-based modeling is the difficulty of conditioning to dense data. One method to achieve data conditioning is to apply optimization techniques. Optimization algorithms can utilize an objective function measuring the conditioning level of each object while also considering the geological realism of the object. Here, an objective function is optimized with implicit filtering which considers constraints on object parameters. Thousands of objects conditioned to data are generated and stored in a database. A set of objects are selected with linear integer programming to generate the final realization and honor all well data, proportions and other desirable geological features. Although any parameterizable object can be considered, objects from fluvial reservoirs are used to illustrate the ability to simultaneously condition multiple types of geologic features. Channels, levees, crevasse splays and oxbow lakes are parameterized based on location, path, orientation and profile shapes. Functions mimicking natural river sinuosity are used for the centerline model. Channel stacking pattern constraints are also included to enhance the geological realism of object interactions. Spatial layout correlations between different types of objects are modeled. Three case studies demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed optimization-simulation method. These examples include multiple channels with high sinuosity, as well as fragmented channels affected by limited preservation. In all cases the proposed method reproduces input parameters for the object geometries and matches the dense well constraints.

                    "title": "Machine Learning-Based Optimization of Well Locations and WAG Parameters under Geologic Uncertainty",
                    "abstract": "The effects of well locations and control parameters on reservoir responses is important during CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection. Oil recovery and CO2 storage capacity typically vary with respect to corresponding changes in WAG ratio, slug size, and injector locations. The relationships between control parameters and response variables are usually studied using compositional simulators. However, the computational expense required to run such simulators could hinder their applicability to optimization procedures requiring many evaluations. Surrogate models (proxies) provide inexpensive alternatives for approximating reservoir responses. In this study, a machine learning-based proxy is developed to predict responses to changes in location and control parameters during WAG injection. Slight adjustments in injector well locations, WAG ratio and slug size could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. This complex relationship between control parameters and reservoir-wide responses makes data-driven methods an attractive option. We extend a recently developed machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and water and gas injection rates, and the primary response is net present value (NPV). Because of the complexity of the response surface, we augmented the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Connectivities are represented by ‘diffusive times of flight’ of the pressure front, which is computed using the Fast Marching Method. Training observations are obtained from a handful of compositional simulations. We then used the Extreme Gradient Boosting method (XGBoost) to build intelligent proxies for making predictions given any set of observations. We propose a hyperdimensional, simultaneous optimization of well locations and controls using a novel optimization scheme similar Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). Our optimization scheme was developed to fully take advantage of the speed and statistical output of the proxy. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study in which the underlying geology is uncertain. Results show significant correlation between proxy predictions and reservoir simulations, which validates application of the trained proxy. In addition, we demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of location and controls yields improvements over a sequential approach without any significant increase in computational cost. "

                    "title": "Fast evaluation of well placements in heterogeneous reservoir models using machine learning",
                    "abstract": "Surrogate models, or proxies, provide computationally inexpensive alternatives for approximating reservoir responses. Proxy models are routinely developed to generate spatially-varying output such as field pressures and saturations, or well responses such as production rates and bottom-hole pressures. In this study, a machine learning approach is adopted to predict reservoir responses based on injector well locations. The proxy developed in this work is trained to reproduce reservoir-wide objective functions, i.e., total profit, cumulative oil/gas produced, or net CO2 stored. Because of the geological complexity of most reservoirs, slight adjustments in injector well locations could yield dramatic changes in the objective function responses. Hence, most proxies do not include well locations as inputs in their formulation. This complex relationship between well locations and reservoir-wide responses makes non-parametric, machine learning-based methods an attractive option. We introduce a machine learning approach in which the primary predictors are physical well locations, and the primary response is a defined objective function such as NPV. The complexity of the response surface with respect to well locations necessitates that we augment the predictor variables with well-to-well pairwise connectivities, injector block permeabilities and porosities, and initial injector block saturations. Introducing well-to-well connectivities yields significant improvements in prediction accuracy. Connectivities are represented by ‘diffusive times of flight’ of the pressure front, which is computed using the Fast Marching Method. A handful of training observations are obtained from numerical reservoir simulations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting method is then used to build an intelligent model for making predictions given any set of observations. The proposed approach is demonstrated using five synthetic case studies: i) a homogeneous reservoir waterflood, ii) a channelized reservoir waterflood, iii) a 20-model ensemble waterflood, iv) a CO2 flood in a heterogeneous reservoir, v) a CO2 flood in a heterogeneous reservoir with complex topography. Results show a significant correlation between proxy predictions and reservoir simulation results. "

                    "abstract": "The study of many slope channel systems has led to the development of rules in the form of observations, measurements, and hypotheses. For example, we hypothesize that high abandonment relief can strongly influence the location of the subsequent channel element and will result in an organized channel stacking pattern in which the path of the younger channel element approximates the path of the former element. The rules were developed with the objective of constructing forward models of petroleum reservoirs that are internally consistent, reproducible, and quantifiable. Channelized turbidite deposits can be interpreted to be the product of multiple cycles of waxing–waning flow energy at multiple scales. Systematic changes in the volume and caliber of turbidity flows through time trigger a fall of the equilibrium profile, which drives erosion and sediment bypass across the slope, followed by a rise of the equilibrium profile, which allows deposition on the slope of increasingly mud-rich sediments through time. In most turbidite successions, at least three scales of waxing–waning cyclicity can be interpreted: element, complex set, and sequence. The stacking pattern of channel elements within a complex set-scale cycle tends to be sequential: (1) erosion and sediment bypass; (2) amalgamation of channel elements associated with a low rate of aggradation; (3) a disorganized stacking pattern of channel elements associated with a moderate rate of aggradation; and (4) an organized stacking pattern of channel elements associated with a high rate of aggradation. Stages 1 and 2 may be absent or minor in mud-rich systems but prominent in sand-rich systems. Conversely, stage 4 may be prominent in mud-rich systems but absent in sand-rich systems. Event-based forward modeling, utilizing rules, can produce realistic architectures, such as the four stages described above. Multiple realizations and multiple alternative models can be constructed to quantitatively examine the probability of specific parameters of interest such as pore volume and connectivity. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid/supercritical carbon dioxide (L/SC-CO2) fracturing is an emerging technology for shale gas development because it can effectively overcome problems related to clay swelling and water scarcity. Recent applications show that L/SC-CO2 fracturing can induce variations in temperature. Understanding of this phenomenon is rudimentary and needs to be carefully addressed to improve the understanding of CO2 thermodynamic behavior, and thus helps to optimize CO2 fracturing in the field. In this paper, we develop a numerical model to assess the impact of thermal effect on fracture initiation during CO2 fracturing. The model couples fluid flow and heat transfer in the fracture, and is verified by a peer-reviewed solution and observation in laboratory experiments. The velocity, pressure, and temperature are calculated at various time to demonstrate the thermodynamic behavior during fracture initiation. A pseudo shock wave is observed, associated with a compression wave and an expansion wave, which finally leads to an increase in temperature in the new fracture and a decrease in temperature in the initial fracture. The thermal stress is derived to investigate the difference between hydraulic fracturing and CO2 fracturing. The results show that thermal stress, resulting from CO2 fracturing initiation, is comparable to the rock strength, which will help induce microfractures, and thus promote the fracture complexity. The formation pressure after CO2 fracturing is also calculated to evaluate the pressure-buildup potential. This work highlights the importance of CO2 expansion during and after fracturing. It is one of the unique features that differs from hydraulic fracturing. For field-design recommendations, to enhance the thermal effect of CO2 fracturing, it is a good strategy to pump CO2 at high pressure and low temperature into the reservoirs with high Young’s modulus, low Poisson’s ratio, low permeability, and high geothermal temperature (or large depth). This paper does not address the dynamics of fracture propagation under the influence of thermal effect. Rather, it intends to demonstrate the potential of the thermal effect of CO2 fluid in assisting the fracture propagation, and the importance of incorporating the compressibility of CO2 into fracture modeling and operation design. Failing to account for this thermal effect might underestimate the fracture complexity and stimulated reservoir volume. "

                    "abstract": "History matching is an important process for uncertainty quantification of reservoir performance. Hundreds of reservoir simulation cases, or more, are typically required to sample the posterior probability density function of the uncertain parameters. The process is extremely challenging for shale reservoirs due to large uncertainties including reservoir heterogeneity, wide range of permeability, gas desorption, and fracture properties. Direct application of stimulated rock volume or dual continuum model fails to capture fracture connectivity and fracture conductivity that dominate the fluid transport in most shale developments. Embedding discrete fractures in reservoir simulation model is thus a preferable method to attain more realistic reservoir behavior. However, the option of using local grid refinement to embed the fractures is computationally expensive as well as intrusive to a reservoir model. Even more challenging is generating a huge set of fracture-embedded reservoir cases during the history matching process. Nevertheless, recent developments in a methodology called Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) have successfully overcome the computational complexity to include discrete fractures in reservoir simulations. We demonstrate the implementation of the assisted history matching workflow coupled with EDFM to history match a real field case of shale gas condensate reservoir in Duvernay Shale, Canada. In the workflow, the EDFM preprocessor is fully coupled with a commercial reservoir simulator and proxy-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Moreover, to further reduce the computational cost, the single-fractured submodel is used to represent the full reservoir model for this case study. Using the proposed assisted history matching workflow and the appropriate submodel enables efficient and successful uncertainty quantification of this shale play. "

                    "abstract": "History matching is a crucial step for reservoir simulation and for decision-making process in field development under uncertainty. The history-matching task is well known to be technically and computationally challenging. Several algorithms have been studied for more than a decade to assist history matching. One of the algorithms used is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is capable of providing accurate posterior probability density (PPD) of the history-matched realizations. While several researchers have applied and studied MCMC for assisted history matching (AHM) in many conventional reservoirs, only few studies have been performed on unconventional reservoirs. Since the difference in physics of the two reservoir types are important, it is worthwhile investigating the performance of AHM in unconventional reservoirs. For this purpose, we apply an AHM workflow using proxy-based MCMC on a shale oil well in Vaca Muerta formation to demonstrate application of the workflow and highlight the lessons learnt. The direct MCMC is also performed on the same field case to compare accuracy and efficiency of the first method. In this study, design of experiment (DOE) is used for selecting the most influential uncertain parameters before performing either of the two MCMC methods. It is found that the direct MCMC cannot find enough solutions to construct the statistically meaningful PPD in an efficient manner. By contrast, the proxy-based MCMC is less computationally demanding than the direct MCMC and efficient enough to construct the PPD. The tested workflow was then used to probabilistically forecast the cumulative oil and water production as well as the oil recovery factor for the Vaca Muerta well. "

                    "abstract": "Economic production from unconventional reservoirs requires long horizontal wells with an extensive hydraulic fracture network. However, the ultimate recovery factor under primary depletion still remains less than 10% of original oil in place. Recently, CO2 huff-n-puff technique has shown promising results in improving the recovery from liquid- rich shale reservoirs by reducing oil viscosity, swelling oil volume, and vaporizing and extracting hydrocarbon from the matrix. This paper discusses the technical and economic potential of CO2 huff-n-puff in unconventional reservoirs. In this work, CO2 huff-n-puff process in Middle Bakken is studied by using a commercial reservoir simulator. We performed history matching on reservoir performance using the available production data. Next, we used the history matched model and estimated incremental oil recovery due to CO2 huff-n-puff considering operational parameters such as gas type, injection rate, depletion state of the reservoir, number of cycles, and cycles duration. Several mechanisms are contributing to incremental oil recovery in gas cycling process. repressurization and oil swelling are the main mechanisms in this process. The study of operational parameters indicated that there is an optimum time for the start of gas cycling, injection rate and duration of the cycles. Beginning the gas cycling operations too early in the life of the well will negatively affect the effectiveness of the process. There is an optimum injection rate for gas cycling operations. Low gas injection rate does not sufficiently increase the pressure and thus oil recovery compared to higher injection rates. Moreover, injecting gas with high rates with higher operational costs does not considerably increase oil recovery. Additionally we indicated that as the number of cycles increase, the volume of injected gas increase and oil recovery approximately linearly increases with the injected gas volume. There is an optimum duration of injection period depending on reservoir pressure in the near-wellbore region and surface gas injection rate. Longer soaking times resulted in minimal beneficial effect on incremental oil recovery. Longer production periods increased oil recovery but at later times. The presented simulation workflow provides fundamental understanding of the key parameters affecting the CO2 huff-n-puff performance such as reservoir properties, starting time of gas injection, gas injection rate/pressure, soaking time, optimum duration of cycles, and number of cycles. The outcome of this study results in fundamental understanding of huff-n-puff feasibility and design, and optimized operating conditions. "

                    "abstract": "The push to extend fracturing to arid regions is drawing attention to water-free techniques, such as liquid/supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) fracturing. It is important to understand CO2 flow behavior and thus to estimate the friction loss accurately in CO2 fracturing, but no focus on CO2 friction loss in large-scale tubulars has been made until now. Because of the difficulty in conducting field-scale experiments, we develop a computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) model to simulate CO2 flow in circular pipes in this paper. The realizable k-e turbulence model is used to simulate the large-Reynolds-number fully turbulent flow. An accurate equation of state (EOS) and transport models of CO2 are used to account for CO2-properties variations with pressure and temperature. The roughness of the pipe wall also is considered. Our model is verified by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data of liquid CO2 and correlations developed for water-based fluid. It is confirmed that the friction loss of CO2 follows the phenomenological Darcy-Weisbach equation, regardless of the sensitivity of CO2 properties to pressure and temperature. The commonly used correlations also can give good predictions of the Darcy friction factor of CO2 within an acceptable tolerance of 4.5%, where the pressure range is 8 to 80 MPa, the temperature range is 250 to 400 K, the tubular-diameter range is 25.4 to 222.4 mm, and the Reynolds-number range is 105–108. Of all correlations used in this paper, the ones proposed by Colebrook and White (1937), Swamee and Jain (1976), Churchill (1977), and Haaland (1983) are recommended for field use. Finally, we investigate the influence of flowing pressure and temperature on Reynolds number, Darcy friction factor, and friction loss of CO2, and compare the difference between friction loss of water and of CO2 at different pressure, temperature, and flow-rate conditions.

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic stimulation of unconventional shale and tight reservoirs often creates a complex induced fracture network, which requires a comprehensive characterization for successful exploitation and development. One of the major technologies applied over the past decade to image hydraulic fractures is microseismic monitoring, which analyzes seismic information recorded during hydraulic stimulation to locate the rock deformation. Results of the microseismic data interpretation are then used to generate and calibrate a model of the hydraulic fracture network. However, because of the complexity of the fracture model and the shortcomings of reservoir simulators, direct application of these complex fracture networks has been very limited. Instead, oversimplified models are used to assess the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. Such assessment techniques, without further modeling and simulation of hydrocarbon production and pressure drainage, fail to represent an accurate view of the connectivity and complexity of the fracture system. In this paper, we present the application of an Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) in numerical simulation of realistic geometry of fractures. With EDFM, each fracture plane is embedded inside the computational matrix grid and is discretized by cell boundaries. We have implemented EDFM in The University of Texas at Austin (UT) in-house reservoir simulator UTCOMP. We discuss the implementation approach using non-neighboring connections. Using the developed simulator, we studied gas production from hydraulic fracture networks calibrated from actual microseismic monitoring data. We investigated the impact of fracture network geometry on the overall performance of these hydraulic stimulations. Simulation results indicate that the efficiency of well treatment is primarily controlled by the interconnectivity of hydraulic fractures and the distribution of conductivity within the fracture network. For a given microseismic cloud, a wide range of production responses was observed by changing the degree of connectivity in the calibrated model. Moreover, the study showed that taking into account the role of aseismic deformations (such as tensile openings) significantly increased cumulative production forecasts. Neglecting the effect of these fractures may lead to underestimation of ultimate recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Tremendous amount of oil and gas left behind in unconventional reservoirs, especially in the United States. Therefore, it is necessary to economically recover these shale-based energy resources by the effective hydraulic fracturing technology. In this paper, a pseudo-component black oil reservoir simulator was used to evaluate the gas production from a synthetic shale gas reservoir through hydraulic fracturing (HF). In that reservoir, one horizontal well was placed with 11 hydraulic fractures to predict the future reservoir performance within 22-year prediction period. The base case of HF simulation was set with a default values for the hydraulic fracturing parameters along with default production well constraints. The HF design parameters included are fracture conductivity and permeability, fracture width and half length, layers up and down, and minimum fracture spacing. The production well constraints were minimum bottom hole pressure and maximum gas production rate. Next, Design of Experiments (DoE) and proxy modeling were adopted for the optimization of hydraulic fracturing design through the shale gas production. In particular, these operational controllable parameters were manipulated using the Latin Hypercube Design (LHD-DoE) approach to obtain the optimal gas production and to build the proxy models. Two successive sets of experiments (running cycles) were designed by mixing the levels of these operational parameters using the LHD-DoE. The optimization approach significantly increased the cumulative gas production about 1.3734E9 SCF in the 1st running cycle and 3.6583E9 in the 2nd running cycle over the base case of default parameter setting. The 2nd running cycles (640 runs) were successively implemented after refining the range of each parameter based on the outcome of the first running cycle (550 runs). After that, two proxy models were constructed to obtain a simplified reduced-physics metamodel alternative to the complex (full-physics) reservoir simulator: 2nd degree polynomial equation and RBF Neural Network. The two proxy approaches led to accurate matching between the simulator- and proxy-based cumulative gas production. However, RBF-NN was more accurate prediction of cumulative gas production than the polynomial regression. Finally, Sobol sensitivity analysis was adopted to determine the most influencing hydraulic fracture parameters and well constraints that impact the shale gas production performance. Sobol analysis was adopted based on the RBF-NN and polynomial proxy models. In descending order, the most influencing parameters are the fracture half-length, layers up, layers down, and the minimum bottom hole pressure in the production well. The other HF had essentially negligible impact on the cumulative gas production performance. The fracture half-length was by far the most influential factor affecting the shale reservoir performance because this parameter is directly related to the total fracture area in which the gas produced.

                    "abstract": "Increase in energy demand has played a significant role in the persistent exploitation and exploration of unconventional oil and gas resources. Shale gas reservoirs are one of the major unconventional resources. Advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have been the key to achieve economic rates of production from these shale gas reservoirs. In addition to their ultra-low permeability, shale gas reservoirs are characterized by their complex gas transport mechanisms and complex natural and induced (hydraulic) fracture geometries. Production from shale gas reservoirs is predominantly composed of two-phase flow of gas and water. However, proper modeling of the two-phase behavior as well as incorporating the complex fracture geometries have been a challenge within the industry. Due to the limitation of local grid refinement approach, hydraulic fractures are assumed to be planar (orthogonal), which is an unrealistic assumption. Although more flexible approaches are available, such as the use of unstructured grids, they require significantly high computational resources. In this paper, we introduce an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) to explicitly model complex fracture geometries. The EDFM efficient approach is capable of explicitly modeling complex fracture geometries without increasing the computational demand. Utilizing EDFM alongside a commercial simulator, we constructed a 3D reservoir model to investigate the effect of complex fracture geometries on the two-phase flow of a shale gas well. In our investigation, varying degrees of hydraulic fracture complexity with 1-set and 2-set of natural fractures were tested. The simulation results confirm the importance of properly modeling fracture complexity, highlighting that it plays an integral part in the estimation of gas and water recoveries. In addition, the simulation results hint to the pronounced effect of fracture interference as fracture complexity increases. Finally, variable fracture conductivities and initial water saturation values were analyzed to further assess their effect on the two-phase production behavior of the shale gas well. This study examines the effect of non-orthogonal complex fracture geometry on the two-phase flow of shale gas wells. The work can provide a significant insight toward understanding the extent to which fracture complexity can affect the performance of shale gas wells. "

                    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that oil recovery during waterflooding can be improved by modifying the composition of the injected brine. A typical approach is diluting the formation water to a specific lower salinity. However, recent experimental studies report the adverse effect of formation water dilution on oil recovery for specific oil/brine/rock systems. The adverse effect depends on the interactions within the system and is more pronounced in carbonates. In this study, we investigated the effect of water composition on the performance of low salinity water injection by considering the complex interplay interaction of oil, brine, and rock system. We used a coupled in-house compositional simulator and geochemical (IPhreeqc) framework for this study. Using this simulator we were able to capture true physics of the modified salinity waterflooding process. First, employing PHREEQC, we developed a surface complexation model for oil and rock surfaces to calculate the zeta-potential at these two surfaces. Second, we considered a water film between oil and rock and used DLVO theory to calculate the attractive/repulsive forces between oil and rock surfaces. Furthermore, we used the augmented Young-Laplace equation to calculate the resulting contact angle of the system. Then, we defined an interpolating parameter as a function of the calculated contact angle to predict wettability alteration. Finally, the geochemistry model was implemented in UTCOMP-IPhreeqc to investigate the effect of modified salinity water injection on wettability alteration and enhanced oil recovery. In order to validate our approach, the results of our simulations were compared with a recently published coreflood experiment. Our results show that in carbonates, the charge of the oil/brine and rock/brine surfaces is a determining factor for the success of modified salinity waterflooding. Our contact angle calculations using DLVO theory and the augmented Young-Laplace equation accurately estimated the dynamic trend of contact angle during low salinity flood. Moreover, our zeta potential calculations based on surface complexation model reproduced the experimental data of oil/brine and brine/calcite zeta potential measurements. Modeling wettability alteration as a function of contact angle was sufficient to predict the low salinity effect in carbonates. Similar approach can be used to model low salinity effect in sandstones. We believe this is the first study that a comprehensive compositional reactive transport simulator is used to assess modified salinity waterflooding as a function of contact angle, employing DLVO theory and surface complexation model.

In unconventional reservoirs, the negative effect of scale formation and deposition becomes more pronounced as it severely damages the conductivity of hydraulic fractures. However, how and to what extent the scaling changes the gas production is unclear. In this work, a robust and integrated tool is developed to model scale deposition under dynamic flow conditions in unconventional reservoirs considering the damages to fracture and shale matrix. In doing so, a comprehensive compositional reservoir simulator (UTCOMP) coupled with IPhreeqc is utilized to predict carbonate and sulfate scales formation in the Marcellus shale formations. This integrated approach allows to adequately resolve the multiphase flow in the fracture network and near-wellbore region and to determine the associated geochemical behavior. Our results show that scale formation mainly results from changes in the physicochemical properties of brine (pH, temperature, and pressure) and/or mixing with incompatible brine compositions (e.g. mixing of fracturing fluid and formation brine). Precipitations of barite and calcite due to the incompatibility of fracturing fluid with formation water was identified to be the main cause of hydraulic fracture plugging, which resulted in fracture conductivity reduction. Based on the fracturing fluid composition and its invasion depth, fracture conductivity can decrease up to 10%. Due to the complex flowback of the fracturing fluid, we observed a time-dependent fracture plugging. Specifically, a moderate plugging of the fracture face occurs early in Marcellus formation causing a reduction in production peak rate while the fracture tip is severely plugged at later times and further reduces the gas production rate.

Subsequently, asphaltene flow and deposition was studied during miscible gas flooding where four phases (water, oil L1, gas, and second liquid L2) are present.

Although numerous experimental and numerical studies have proven the potential of CO2 Huff-n-Puff, relatively few numerical compositional models exist to comprehensively and efficiently simulate and evaluate CO2 Huff-n-Puff considering CO2 molecular diffusion, nanopore confinement, and complex fractures based on an actual tight-oil well. The objective of this study is to introduce a numerical compositional model with an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) method to simulate CO2 Huff-n-Puff in an actual Eagle Ford tight oil well. Through non-neighboring connections, the EDFM method can properly and efficiently handle any complex fracture geometries without the need of local grid refinement (LGR) nearby fractures. Based on the actual Eagle Ford well, we build a 3D reservoir model including one horizontal well and multiple hydraulic and natural fractures. Six fluid pseudocomponents were considered. We performed history matching with measured flow rates and bottomhole pressure using the EDFM and LGR methods. The comparison results show that a good history match was obtained and a great agreement between EDFM and LGR was achieved. However, the EDFM method performs faster than the LGR method. After history matching, we evaluated the CO2 Huff-n-Puff effectiveness considering CO2 molecular diffusion and nanopore confinement. The traditional phase equilibrium calculation was modified to calculate the critical fluid properties with nanopore confinement. The simulation results show that the CO2 Huff-n-Puff with smaller CO2 diffusion coefficients underperforms the primary production without CO2 injection; nevertheless, the CO2 Huff-n-Puff with larger CO2 diffusion coefficients performs better than the primary production. In addition, both CO2 molecular diffusion and nanopore confinement are favorable for the CO2 Huff-n-Puff effectiveness. The relative increase of cumulative oil production after 7300 days with CO2 diffusion coefficient of 0.01 cm2/s and nanopore size of 10 nm is about 12% for this actual Eagle Ford well. Furthermore, when considering complex natural fractures, the relative increase of cumulative oil production is about 8%. This study provides critical insights into a better understanding of the impacts of CO2 molecular diffusion, nanopore confinement, and complex natural fractures on well performance during CO2 Huff-n-Puff process in the Eagle Ford tight oil reservoirs.

While there are several CWI coreflood experiments reported in the literature, simulation studies for this process are scarce. Accurate modeling of CWI performance requires a simulator with the ability to capture true physics of the CWI process. In this study, a compositional reservoir simulator developed at The University of Texas at Austin, UTCOMP, coupled with a state-of-the-art geochemical package developed by United States Geological Survey, IPhreeqc, is used to model CWI process. We considered the impact of CO2 mass transfer between brine and hydrocarbon phases based on thermodynamic constrains at the reservoir condition. In order to validate our simulation approach, the results of our CWI simulations were compared with a recently published coreflood experiment. Moreover, we investigated the fluid-rock interactions in CWI. The results of the simulations, indicated that prior to water breakthrough the main drive mechanism is displacement. But as more carbonated water is injected, CO2 diffuses more into the trapped oil left behind, which results in oil swelling and subsequent oil viscosity reduction. Moreover, reaction of carbonate minerals such as calcite with carbonated brine results in dissolution of the main rock matrix which consequently creates wormholes similar to carbonates acidizing. In this study we propose a novel approach for accurate modeling of carbonated waterflooding process. The results of this study highlight the importance of geochemical reactions in modeling CWI process. Our approach has been validated based on history matching at the backdrop of a recently published coreflood experiment. "

However, investigation of the CO2 huff ’n’ puff process in tight oil reservoirs with nanopore confinement is lacking in the petroleum industry. The conventional models need to be modified to consider nanopore confinement in both phase equilibrium and fluid transport. Hence, we develop an efficient model to fill this gap and apply to the field production of the Bakken tight oil reservoir. Complexfracture geometries are also handled in this model. First, we revised the phase equilibrium calculation and evaluated the fluid properties with nanopore confinement. An excellent agreement between this proposed model and the experimental data is obtained considering nanopore confinement. Afterward, we verified the calculated minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) using this model against the experimental data from a rising-bubble apparatus (RBA). We analyzed the MMP and well performance of CO2 EOR in the Bakken tight oil reservoir. On the basis of the prediction of the field data, the MMP is 450 psi lower than the MMP with bulk fluid when the pore size reduces to 10 nm. Subsequently, we examined the effects of key parameters such as matrix permeability and CO2 molecular diffusion on the CO2 huff ’n’ puff process. Results show that both CO2-diffusion and capillary pressure effects improve the oil recovery factor from tight oil reservoirs, which should be correctly implemented in the simulation model. Finally, we analyzed well performance of a field-scale horizontal well from the Bakken Formation with nonplanar fractures and natural fractures. Contributions of CO2-diffusion and capillary pressure effects are also examined in depth in field scale with complex-fracture geometries. The oil recovery factor of the CO2 huff ’n’ puff process with both CO2-diffusion and capillary pressure effects increases by as much as 5.1% in the 20-year period compared with the case without these factors. This work efficiently analyzes the CO2 huff ’n’ puff process with complex-fracture geometries considering CO2 diffusion and nanopore confinement in the field production from the Bakken tight oil reservoir. This model can provide a strong basis for accurately predicting the long-term production with complex-fracture geometries in tight oil reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "The effect of well interference through fracture hits in shale reservoirs needs to be investigated because hydraulic fracturing is abundantly used in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources. Although numerous pressure tests have proved the existence of well interference, relatively few physical models exist to quantitatively simulate the pressure response of well interference. The objective of the present study is to develop a numerical compositional model in combination with a fast embedded-discrete-fracture-model (EDFM) method to simulate well interference. Through nonneighboring connections (NNCs), the fast EDFM method can easily and properly handle complex-fracture geometries, such as nonplanar hydraulic fractures and a large amount of natural fractures. Using public data for Eagle Ford tight oil, we build a reservoir model including up to three horizontal wells and five fluid pseudocomponents. The simulation results show that the connecting hydraulic fractures play a more-important role than natural fractures in declining bottomhole pressure (BHP) of the shut-in well. Matrix permeability has a relatively minor effect on pressure drawdown, and well productivity remains only slightly affected by the overall low permeability used. The BHP pressure-decline profiles change from convex to concave when the conductivity of the connecting fractures increases. At early times, the BHP of the shut-in well decreases when the number of natural fractures increases. At later times, the natural-fracture density has a lesser effect on the pressure response and no clear trend. The opening order of neighboring wells affects the well-interference intensity between the target shut-in well and the surrounding wells. After a systematic investigation of pressure drawdown in the reservoir, we formulate practical conclusions for improved production performance. "

The semianalytical model included three domains: (1) matrix, (2) hydraulic fracture networks, and (3) discrete natural fractures. Using line source function, we developed the diffusivity equation for fluid flow in matrix. By applying the nodal analysis technique, we eliminated the flow interplay at fracture intersections and established the diffusivity equations for fluid flow in hydraulic fracture networks and isolated natural fractures. The pressure transient solution of these diffusivity equations was obtained by using Laplace transforms and Stehfest numerical inversion. Results showed that with the discrete natural fractures, a \"V-shaped\" pressure derivative --the classical dual-porosity feature of naturally fractured reservoirs--emerged. With the hydraulic fracture networks, the reservoir system would exhibit pressure behaviors like \"pseudo-boundary dominated flow\", \"fracture-interference flow\", and \"fluid-feed flow\", etc. All these pressure characteristics were depending on the properties and geometries of natural/hydraulic fractures. In addition, through synthetic field application, we found that different (natural/hydraulic) fracture distributions and geometries had distinct behaviors of pressure derivatives, which may provide an effective tool to identify the properties of randomly distributed natural fractures as well as complex hydraulic fractures in unconventional plays.

This study offers an enhanced estimation of key reservoir and fracture properties with DTS, which may throw light on the further optimization of the fracturing projects. Specifically, we developed a comprehensive numerical model to simulate flow and temperature field in unconventional reservoir with DTS. In our robust wellbore model, multiphase flow with slippage is simulated accurately. Flow and thermal models are fully coupled between wellbore and reservoir model. The new model was validated with exiting simulator of OLGA and CMG. After validation, we applied our model to simulate single fracture and five fractures cases with varying parameters. The impacts of several parameters, including reservoir matrix permeability, fracture conductivity, reservoir rock thermal conductivity, heat exchange coefficient, fracture spacing, and fracture geometry, on temperature profile along the wellbore were analyzed. Several practical conclusions have been drawn from the sensitivity analysis. Although numerous simulators have been developed to simulate the DTS data, relatively few existing models can handle the multiphase flow with slippage, heterogenous reservoir properties and fracture with complex geometries due to the complexity of the calculations and computational cost.

                    "abstract": "During waterflooding, formation heterogeneity controls water sweep efficiency. The location of water-injection wells and operational parameters should be designed based on the heterogeneity of the formation in order to maximize oil production and to avoid early water breakthrough. However, initial geologic and reservoir characterization studies may not provide an accurate view of the location of high-perm zones, channels, and fractures. In this study, we present the application of multi-well pressure pulse testing in the dynamic monitoring of waterflooding sweep efficiency and in the investigation of interwell connectivity. In a pressure pulse test, a periodic injection-rate signal comprising a series of active and shut-in cycles is superimposed on the regular schedule of a candidate injection well, and the corresponding pressure response is recorded at several surrounding wells. Because of the periodic characteristic of the pressure pulse test, pressure response at observation wells can be extracted from background reservoir pressure data; therefore, no well shut-in is required during the test. Pressure data are then transformed into the frequency domain using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Finally, using a modified analytical solution in the frequency domain, the hydraulic diffusivity coefficient is obtained. The modified analytical solution only takes pressure data at the pulsing well and the observation well; no injection-rate data is required in the analysis. We verified the accuracy of pressure pulse testing using a waterflooding case in an inverted five-spot well pattern. The measured hydraulic diffusivity from pulse testing was in agreement with the hydraulic diffusivity coefficient calculated from formation properties. In the next step, we applied pressure pulse testing in a five-spot well pattern with a channel between one of the well pairs. Again, time-lapse analysis of the hydraulic diffusivity coefficient successfully identified the direction of the high-permeability channel, which helped prevent an early water breakthrough. In the last simulation case study, we investigated pressure pulse testing in a synthetic field-scale waterflooding project. We considered a lognormal permeability distribution to mimic formation heterogeneity. Using the information derived in this step, the zones with higher water invasion were determined, which led to modification of well operational parameters such as injection rate and bottom-hole pressures. Optimization of waterflooding design significantly improved sweep efficiency and increased the recovery factor of the process. Pressure pulse testing reasonably predicted the heterogeneity of the formation through interwell hydraulic diffusivity coefficients. Such information substantially assists in future planning and development of the formation. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is the most effective technique used in the oil industry for economical production of hydrocarbon from very-low-permeability reservoirs. Recent experimental studies have indicated a change in hydraulic-fracture (HF) conductivity as the result of the interactions between fracturing fluid and shale matrix. Clay swelling is one of the well-known undesirable interactions of this kind. If clay swelling occurs on the surface of the HF, it can cause major damage to the overall performance of the fracture network. Thus, a detailed understanding of the clay-stability issue is essential for fracturing-fluid selection and operation planning. Clay-swelling-induced conductivity damage is primarily a function of rock mineralogy, fracturing-fluid composition, and formationbrine salinity. Thus, various levels of clay/water interaction are expected in different shale formations. In this study, we present a mechanistic approach to model clay swelling in various rock mineralogies including Barnett (clay-rich), Eagle Ford (calcite-rich), and Marcellus shales. Subsequently, we investigate the production loss caused by clay swelling in a realistic complex HF network. We used UTCOMP-IPhreeqc, a coupled multiphase reactive-transport simulator developed at the University of Texas at Austin, to comprehensively model this process. The ion hydration and the expansion of electrostatic double layer (EDL) were assumed to be the main clayswelling mechanisms. Surface complexation and ion-exchange reactions were considered to capture the ion diffusion into the electrostatic double layer expansion. In each timestep of the simulation, the calculated volume expansion of clay materials exposed on the fracture surface was used to modify the fracture aperture. To evaluate the performance of a complex HF network after clay-swelling damage, the embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) was applied. The simulation results indicated that the degree of clay swelling varies in different shale formations. On the basis of the clay content and the mineralogies that were considered in this work, a significant expansion in electrostatic double layer expansion was observed for the Barnett Shale when fresh water was injected. However, this effect was much lower in Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales. Similarly, the production loss in the HF network was substantial in the Barnett example. The contribution of the fractures far from the producing well in gas production significantly decreased after clay-swelling damage. The pressure-depletion profiles clearly showed the adverse impact of conductivity damage on fracture-network performance. The presented approach provides the capability to mechanistically model the clay stability and to approximate its impact on transport properties of HFs. "

                    "abstract": "Foam has been successfully used in the oil industry for conformance and mobility control in gas-injection processes. The efficiency of a foam-injection project must be assessed by means of numerical models. Although there are several foam-flow models in the literature, the prediction of foam behavior is an important issue that needs further investigation. In this paper, we estimate foam parameters and investigate foam behavior for a given range of water saturation by use of two local equilibrium foam models: the population balance assuming local equilibrium (LE) model and the University of Texas (UT) model. Our method uses an optimization algorithm to estimate foam-model parameters by matching the measured pressure gradient from steady-state foam-coreflood experiments. We calculate the effective foam viscosity and the water fractional flow by use of experimental data, and we then compare laboratory data against results obtained with the matched foam models to verify the foam parameters. Other variables, such as the foam texture and foam relative permeability, are used to further investigate the behavior of the foam during each experiment. We propose an improvement to the UT model that provides a better match in the high-quality regime by assuming resistance factor and critical water saturation as a linear function of the pressure gradient. Results show that the parameter-estimation method coupled with an optimization algorithm successfully matches the experimental data by use of both foam models. In the LE model, we observe different values of the foam effective viscosity for each pressure gradient caused by variations of foam texture and the shear-thinning viscosity effect. The UT model presents a constant effective viscosity for each pressure gradient; we propose the use of resistance factor and critical water saturation as a linear function of the pressure gradient to improve the match in the high-quality regime, when applicable.

                    "abstract": "Model developments for transient analysis of fractured horizontal wells have gained tremendous attention in tight reservoirs, especially, during the flowback period. However, the existing models so far have rarely considered two-phase flow and complex fracture networks. To improve this situation, in this work, we present a new semianalytical two-phase flow model. Water and oil simultaneously flow in the matrix and fracture networks. By iteratively correcting the relative permeability to water and gas phases, we incorporate the two-phase flow into fracture model. Complex fracture networks with arbitrary geometries are described and the fluid flow interplays at fracture intersections are eliminated through mass balance equation. The model solution is obtained by using Laplace transform inversion, and it is verified by performing a case study with a numerical simulator. Our results show that there exist two distinct flow regimes: fluid feed and pseudo-boundary dominated flow (PBDF), which is generated by the permeability contrast between fracture networks and matrix. We also investigate the impacts of some key reservoir and fracture properties on the characteristics of productivity index. Results indicate that the productivity index increases with an increase in initial water saturation. Furthermore, it is found that during the PBDF, different fracture-network parameters have various constant productivity indexes, providing an efficient tool to characterize the fracture networks. Based on that, we apply the model to estimate the fracture networks of a tight-oil well in CJ formation at Tarim Bain with flowback data and micro seismic data, which provides an efficient technique to estimate the stimulation effectiveness during the flowback period.

A field-scale numerical compositional reservoir model was built based on typical fluid, reservoir, and fracture properties from the Middle Bakken Formation. The effect of matrix permeability ranging from 0.001 mD to 0.1 mD on the comparison of well performance of these two scenarios was investigated. A critical value of permeability was identified. When the permeability is lower than 0.03 mD, the CO2 Huff-n-Puff performs better than the continuous CO2 injection. Subsequently, experiment design and response surface methodology was used to perform sensitivity studies with four uncertain parameters including matrix permeability, number of wells, well pattern, and fracture half-length. The results show that the matrix permeability is the most significant parameter, followed by well pattern and the interaction between fracture half-length and number of wells. Furthermore, three diagnostic contour plots corresponding to 4, 6, and 8 horizontal wells per square mile were generated. Based on these plots, it is convenient to identify the best zone with better CO2-EOR effectiveness for different CO2 injection scenarios. This study can provide a very useful tool for a better understanding of CO2-EOR strategy determination in tight oil reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Selecting an appropriate equation of state (EOS) to model asphaltene precipitation in compositional wellbore and reservoir simulators is still unclear in the literature. Recent studies have shown that the PC-SAFT model is more appropriate for modeling asphaltene precipitation compared to the commonly used solid model. The main objective of this paper is to compare the solid and PC-SAFT models in both static and dynamic asphaltene modeling. Through fluid characterization, the capabilities of both models are compared to reproduce precipitation experimental data. The results show that both solid and PC-SAFT models are capable of predicting the amount of asphaltene precipitation with high accuracy. Although the matching process using the PC-SAFT model is much easier, the properly tuned solid model is also able to reproduce the experimental data with the same quality as the PC-SAFT model. The simulation results show that the PC-SAFT model is superior to the solid model in terms of the extrapolation accuracy when the experimental data are not available for the simulation conditions (i.e., variation in temperature, pressure, and fluid composition in the reservoir/wellbore). However, both models are applicable for interpolation when the experimental data cover the entire range of the simulation condition. The wellbore simulations show that although the trend of asphaltene deposition is similar for both models, the solid model using Peng-Robinson EOS overestimates the amount of asphaltene precipitation and deposition in the wellbore compared to the PC-SAFT model. On the other hand, the simulation procedure using the PC-SAFT model takes much more computational time as this model uses an iterative solution to obtain the density roots and the phase equilibrium calculation.

                    "abstract": "Oilfield problems owing to asphaltene precipitation are well known. Asphaltenes can block pore throats or change the formation wettability and thereby reduce the hydrocarbon mobility. Simulation of asphaltene precipitation during gas injection requires a comprehensive thermodynamic model, which accounts for the complex phase behavior of asphaltenes. In this paper, PC-SAFT EOS is implemented for the first time in a compositional reservoir simulator to model asphaltene precipitation. The additional computational time of PC-SAFT compared to the cubic equations-of-state such as Pen-Robinson (PR EOS) is decreased by improving its root finding algorithm. A deposition and wettability alteration model is then integrated with the thermodynamic model to simulate the dynamics of precipitated asphaltenes. Different gas injection scenarios are modeled to show the effect of gas injection on apshaltene precipitation and deposition. Simulation results show that the profile of the damaged area by asphaltene deposition is governed by the shape of the asphaltene precipitation envelope for the reservoir fluid. The damage caused by asphaltene deposition, through plugging and wettability alteration, was revealed as a decline in productivity index curves. Results indicate that a reservoir fluid can have precipitation risk during gas injection even if it does not exhibit precipitation in the primary recovery life of a field. The computational time of the simulations using PC-SAFT EOS were compared to those using PR EOS for different number of components. Results of these comparisons show the feasibility of using PC-SAFT in compositional simulations. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Comprehensive mechanism-based investigation of stimulations in naturally fractured reservoirs promotes the development of new hydraulic fracture models in a finite element method platform, Abaqus. Our triple-stage, triple-wellbore hydraulic fracturing simulations are accomplished using fully coupled pore-pressure-stress analyses, a well-established mechanism-based intersection model based on cohesive zone model, and a novel universal wellbore-perforation model for simultaneous and sequential fracturing scenarios. We quantified cluster stimulation, the activation of a complex natural fracture (NF) network, and fluid infiltration depending on the stimulation scenario, wellbore pressure drop, randomly distributed perforation lengths, and fracturing fluid viscosity. The stimulation patterns are featured by the following: 1) dominant effect of the perforation tunnel lengths in the cluster stimulation in the presence of the wellbore model; 2) doubled cluster stimulation in the absence of the NF network; 3) more control on the cluster stimulation and wider stimulated reservoir volumes in sequential fracturing compared to simultaneous fracturing; and 4) stronger stress shadowing effect in sequential fracturing with hydraulic pressure connectivity of stage clusters through the wellbore. This mechanistic model that integrates the NF network, its intersection with the hydraulic fractures, and the hydraulic connection of perforations through the wellbore clearly demonstrates a technique to refine stimulated reservoir volumes and better explain microseismic anomalies. 1. INTRODUCTION Hydraulic fracturing stimulation has been widely deployed for the economic production from hydrocarbon-bearing ultra-low permeable shale formations. The design and optimization of these stimulation processes strongly depends on robust computational models because of numerous controlling parameters and the complexity of the geological formations. As a dominating complexity in the hydraulic fracturing design, the natural fracture (NF) network and connections to the hydraulic fractures may improve or damage the long-term production from the hydrocarbon reservoir. For instance, the damage to the long-term production may occur due to the fluid flow interference of the offset horizontal wells through the NF network induced by primarily independent hydraulic fractures. This interference can be observed frequently in microseismic surveys, e.g. for a four-well pad as shown in Fig. 1. In this figure, the events associated with the stimulations along each horizontal wellbore are grouped together by a unique color. Due to the color overlap between all neighboring well couples, the fracture runaway from one wellbore to the other one is eminent. "

                    "abstract": "Two-phase flow is generally significant in the hydraulic-fracturing design of a shale-gas reservoir, especially during the flowback period. Investigating the gas- and water-production data is important to evaluate stimulation effectiveness. We develop a semianalytical model for multifractured horizontal wells by incorporating the two-phase flow in both shale matrix and fracture domains. The complex-fracture network, including both primary/hydraulic fractures and secondary/natural fractures, is modeled explicitly as discretized segments. The node-analysis approach is used to discretize the networks into a number of fracture segments and connected nodes, depending on the complexity of the fracture system. The two-phase flow is incorporated by iteratively correcting the relative permeability to gas/water for each fracture segment and capillary pressure at each node with the fracture depletion. The accuracy of the proposed model is confirmed by the numerical model. Subsequently, the early-time gas- and water-production performance is analyzed by use of various fracture geometries and network configurations. The model was also used to history match an actual multistage hydraulically fractured horizontal well in the Marcellus Shale during the flowback period. The research findings have shed light on the factors that substantially influence the gas- and water-production behavior during the flowback period. We also investigate the effects of fracture-network geometries and complexities on the gas/water-ratio (GWR) diagnostic plots. The results depict that the GWR behavior on the diagnostic plots is highly dependent on fracture-network geometry, configuration, and connectivity, which could assist in deriving the critical fracture properties affecting the production performance. This work extends the semianalytical approach previously proposed for modeling single-phase to two-phase flowback problems in unconventional reservoirs with various fracture-network geometries. The method is easier to set up and is less data-intensive than use of a numerical reservoir simulator, and is capable of providing a straightforward and flexible way to model complex-nonplanar-fracture networks in a multiphase-flow environment.

                    "abstract": "Response-surface methodology (RSM) has been widely used in the petroleum industry as an assistive tool for numerical-reservoir-simulation studies. Instead of generating simulation cases exhaustively to solve history-matching (HM) problems, proxy models that are created by RSM provide useful benefits in terms of simplicity and computational efficiency. However, the capability of proxy models to fully capture uncertainty ranges of HM results and production forecasts might be deficient in complex problems if the simplified proxy models only deliver partial solutions. Hence, to decide whether the uncertainty-assessment process by proxy models is complete, the models should deliver as many HM solutions as required to build probability distribution of production forecasts. Therefore, we developed the work flow to combine both processes into an integrated proxy-based approach that searches for the accepted HM solution while probabilistic forecasts are evaluated simultaneously. In addition, the combined work flow is an iterative approach. It gradually modifies the proxy models dependent on the increasing number of completed simulation runs, which continually update the original proxy model into higher degree of polynomial. The use of higher-degree-polynomial equations appears to have the benefit to provide an expanded set of HM solutions inside the uncertain parameter space compared with the commonly used quadratic form. More solutions found from the iterations could eventually approximate wider uncertainty ranges of probabilistic forecasts, which is consistent with the direct Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method but with a significant reduction of simulated cases. Finally, this paper applies the proxy-based approach to a reservoir-simulation model containing a horizontal hydraulic-fractured well in the Marcellus Shale formation. This proxy-based approach helps assess the uncertainty of reservoir and fracture properties of unconventional reservoirs. Also, it is useful for evaluating the ranges of ultimate gas recovery. "

                    "abstract": "With the development of shale gas reservoirs, various fracture-propagation models have been developed to predict hydraulic-fracture geometry by considering the stress-shadow effects. Also, many researchers have been working on the development of various production/simulation approaches to simulate production from the complex fracture geometries. The objective of this study is to combine the fracture-propagation modeling and reservoir simulation to optimize production in shale gas reservoirs. First, we have developed a semianalytical model to simulate shale gas production from the nonplanar-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. The important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption are considered. Second, we have developed a fracture-propagation model to predict the nonplanar-fracture geometry by fully coupling elastic deformation of the rock and fluid flow. In this study, the effect of varying number of perforation clusters within a given stage ranging from two to six on the fracture propagation was investigated. Three values of stage spacing were considered including 100, 200, and 300 ft. After predicting the nonplanar-fracture geometry, the semianalytical model is used to simulate production from such fracture geometries. The effects of the number of clusters per stage for varying stage spacing on well productivity were examined. In addition, we compared the well performance with varying stage spacings of 100, 200, and 300 ft under a given lateral length of 2,500 ft. Furthermore, we coupled the fracture-propagation and semianalytical models to analyze a field well performance in a shale gas reservoir. Through the field-case study, a nonplanar-fracture geometry with a good history match was quantified. Also, the difference between the nonplanar-fracture geometry and the converted equivalent planar-fracture geometry with equal fracture length was examined. Finally, the optimal fracture-treatment design for the field well development was recommended. This work can provide new insights into optimization of the number of perforation clusters per stage within a given fracture stage in shale gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique aiming at improving formation permeability or bypassing damaged zones. In this process, acid is injected through the well into the wellbore vicinity to dissolve the rock. For either production or injection wells, the formation may contain multiple phases (oil and water) near the wellbore region when acid treatment begins. In this paper, a two-phase two-scale continuum model is developed to simulate wormhole propagation under radial coordinates. The model describes the mechanisms of convection, dispersion, and reaction in two-phase flow during matrix acidizing. We have validated the simulation model with two methods: one is to compare with the previous simulation results; the other is to compare with the analytical solution. We have investigated conditions that will affect the wormhole-propagation process, including rock wettability, oil viscosity, and initial oil saturation. It is found that the water/oil mobility ratio is a key factor that affects acidizing efficiency. In addition, we have proposed a new criterion for acid breakthrough because the pressure response is affected not only by reaction, but also by overall mobility change in the formation. The traditional criterion for the single-phase model is no longer applicable to the current two-phase model. The results show that adverse water/oil mobility ratio leads to a higher efficiency for wormhole breakthrough. In carbonate reservoirs with heterogeneity, water/oil displacement and wormhole propagation contribute to narrower, less-branched channels. For the first time, it is possible to simulate formations with multiple phases during carbonate acidizing. The presented model improves our understanding in the optimization of carbonate acidizing.

                    "abstract": "Although a large amount of wells has been extensively drilled to develop unconventional reservoirs, uncertainty associated with reservoir and fracture properties can significantly affect the evaluation of an individual well’s performance with simulations. From the history-matching point of view, this uncertainty causes nonuniqueness of solutions that should be obtained with a robust probabilistic method without overly exhausting simulation resources. Because of the challenge in this work, a proxy-based history-matching approach can deliver unique advantages of reducing the computational requirement and providing probabilistic interpretation. The work flow presented in this paper is designed to exploit full ranges of proxy-modeling benefits from prioritizing significant reservoir properties, estimating the variation of model responses, and searching multiple history-matching solutions for reliable probabilistic forecasts. A screening process is introduced at the initial stage of the work flow with design of experiment (DOE) and response-surface methodology (RSM), so the dimensions of proxy models can be reduced. In addition, the proxy models progress through the work flow by iterations that aim to improve their accuracy. This iterative work flow efficiently uses simulation resources by use of all the completed runs to provide more information about the model responses for the subsequent iterations. While the work flow is being iterated, multiple proxy models are explored for history-matching solutions by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Then, history-matching solutions are used to evaluate the probability distribution of the long-term estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Finally, an application of the work flow to a horizontal well in the Middle Bakken is presented in this paper. "

First, the current models are challenging to efficiently handle the complex nonplanar fractures with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length caused by very-complicated gridding issues, a high computational cost, and complexities in development of computational codes. Second, the conventional gas-diffusivity equation needs to be revised to include all important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption. Hence, the goal of this study was to develop a new model to fill this gap. We present an efficient semianalytical model by dividing fractures into several fracture segments to represent the complex nonplanar-fracture geometry and present a revised diffusivity equation to consider all the important gas-transport mechanisms for shale-gas reservoirs. We verified this model against a numerical reservoir simulator and an analytical solution for a single planar fracture. Transient-flow behavior between planar fractures and nonplanar fractures with and without considering the natural fractures was compared. Furthermore, a well with actual production data from the Marcellus Shale was analyzed. First, we use a complex hydraulic-fracture-propagation model to generate nonplanarfracture geometry. Then, we apply the fracture geometry in the semianalytical model to evaluate well performance. Contributions of each mechanism to gas recovery are examined. By use of history matching and production forecasting, the difference of cumulative gas production between the nonplanar fractures and the converted planar fractures with equal fracture length is approximately 12% at 30 years of production. In addition, the contribution of gas diffusion, gas slippage, and gas desorption to gas recovery at 30 years of production compared with that without considering them is approximately 11, 16, and 25%, respectively. In total, the contribution of these three important mechanisms is approximately 56%.

The compositional wellbore simulator (UTWELL) is developed by applying different numerical approaches and flow-regime-detection methods to accurately model multiphase flow in the wellbore. In addition, several deposition mechanisms are incorporated for the transportation, entrainment, and deposition of solid particles in the wellbore. Subsequently, a geochemical module, IPhreeqc, is integrated into the wellbore model to handle homogeneous and heterogeneous, reversible and irreversible, and ion-exchange reactions under either local-equilibrium or kinetic conditions. This package provides a robust, flexible, and accurate integrated tool for mechanistic modeling of scale deposition in the wellbore. Through our integrated simulator, deposition profiles of carbonate and sulfate scales in the wellbore are predicted for several case studies. Significant effects of physiochemical properties (such as pressure, temperature, salinity, and pH value) on the scale deposition in the wellbore are discussed. In addition, comparing simulation results with experimental data reveals that hydrocarbon-phase dissolution has a significant effect on geochemical calculations compared with the temperature/pressure variation effects. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive simulator available in the industry through which scale deposition in the wellbore can be predicted accurately. In this paper, scale deposition profile in the wellbore is estimated by including the interaction of the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases and its effect on the aqueous-scale geochemistry (by use of a compositional wellbore simulator); effects of parameters that vary greatly in the wellbore (pressure, temperature, and pH value); and comprehensive geochemistry simulation (provided through coupling of the wellbore simulator with IPhreeqc).

However, the disadvantages associated with these liners, such as high operation costs, corrosion susceptibility, and safety considerations in subsequent mining processes, can limit their performance. One possible alternative is a plastic slotted liner. A major challenge for designing a plastic slotted liner is providing sufficient structural integrity without creating a significant restriction for gas that flows into a wellbore. In this paper, we present an optimization design for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) slotted liners. Our design couples the influence of the mechanical integrity of the liner and the inflow performance. The optimization parameters are the slot geometrical parameters. The boundary conditions are identified by the failure criteria and the influence of various slot-parameter adjustments through laboratory compression experiments. Two models--a collapse-bearing-capacity model and a skin-factor model (Furui et al. 2005)--are used to optimize the design of the PVC slotted liners. A genetic algorithm is used to maximize the collapse-bearing capacity and minimize the skin factor. Finally, a selection guide for the optimal combination of slot parameters is provided. The key findings of this work are beneficial for determining the design criteria of plastic slotted liners in horizontal CBM wells.

In this study, we present a methodology to investigate the phase behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2)/hydrocarbon systems with and without the capillary pressure effect. We modify the Peng-Robinson equation of state considering inequalities of hydrocarbon liquid and vapor pressures. Rachford-Rice flash calculation, criterion of Gibbs free energy minimization, and Newton-Raphson method are utilized together to calculate the phase equilibrium between vapor and liquid. In addition, the Young-Laplace equation is applied to evaluate the capillary pressure in the presence of pore size distribution. We validate the methodology against one experimental measurement with the capillary pressure effect. Subsequently, we perform two case studies including a two-component system and a typical fluid from Bakken tight oil reservoirs. The results indicate that the reduction in the nano-pore size causes noticeable difference in the two-phase envelope. Furthermore, for the real fluid, the capillary pressure effect cannot be neglected when the pore size is less than 50 nm. Additionally, the bubble-point pressure of Bakken oil reduces nearby 500 psi when the nano-pore size reduces to 10 nm. The MMP of CO2 injection is also evaluated, which experiences a decreasing trend.

In our methodology we use the EDFM and calculate fracture blocks connections using a transmissibility equation which allows varying aperture and permeability (conductivity) in the fracture plane. Additionally, we developed and implemented a methodology that allows the discretization of fracture planes with heterogeneous conductivity in a Cartesian grids. Two systems of coordinates, a real and a normalized system, were defined into the fracture plane to translate hydraulic fracture properties to the EDFM preprocessor. The hydraulic fracture plane is normalized by its length and height; fracture properties (aperture and permeability) from the continuum plane are assigned to normalized coordinates and translated to the Cartesian grid. Hydraulic fracture planes are embedded using our EDFM preprocessor, which allows the modeling of fractures with different geometries distributions. In the results the proposed transmissibility equation was verified against a fine model and a good match was observed. The effect of fracture geometry and heterogeneity was evaluated for a multi fractured horizontal well with three hydraulic fractures producing from a tight oil reservoir. The applications show that the cumulative oil production estimated from homogeneous rectangular hydraulic fractures are optimistic when compared to more realistic hydraulic fractures. "

Recent advances in fracture-diagnostic tools and fracture-propagation models make it necessary to model fractures with complex geometries in reservoir-simulation studies. In this paper, we present an efficient method to model fractures with complex geometries with reservoir simulators. Through nonneighboring connections (NNCs), an embedded discrete-fracture modeling (EDFM) formulation is applied to reservoir simulators to properly model fractures with complex geometries such as fracture networks and nonplanar hydraulic fractures. We demonstrate the accuracy of the approach by performing a series of case studies with two commercial reservoir simulators and comparing the results with local-grid-refinement (LGR) models and a semi-analytical solution. The limitations of the model are also discussed. In addition, the results show its computational efficiency as the complexity of fractures increases. We also present two numerical case studies to demonstrate the applicability of our method in naturally fractured reservoirs. The nonintrusive application of the EDFM allows insertion of the discrete fractures into the computational domain and the use of original functionalities of the simulators without having access to the source code of the simulators. It may be easily integrated into existing frameworks for unconventional reservoirs to perform sensitivity analysis, history matching, and production forecasting. "

The fundamental mechanisms have been investigated by many lab experiments and the feasibility has been evaluated by some field applications. However, there is no model that can handle this combined EOR process. In this paper, a mechanistic model is proposed to predict the EOR performance after polymer flooding. This new coupled model incorporates the surfactant transport module into the model of PPG treatment after polymer flooding. Especially, the interaction mechanisms between PPG and surfactant are mathematically described according to the lab experiments. An implicit pressure explicit composition method is adopted to numerically solve the coupled model. The newly presented model is firstly validated with a commercial simulator and some core flooding experiments. Then, the verified model is employed to predict the performance for actual field pilot cases. Parameters analysis is conducted on a conceptual model for PPG conformance control after polymer flooding. The results show that the coupled model provides an efficient and accurate method for predicting PPG-surfactant flooding performance after polymer flooding, which aids to determine the technical feasibility of the field project.

                    "abstract": "Scale deposition in surface and subsurface production equipment is one of the major operational problems encountered during oil production, which results in equipment corrosion, wellbore plugging, production rate decline, and requires frequent squeeze treatments. Oil field scales mainly result from changes in the physicochemical properties (pH, temperature, and pressure), mixing with incompatible brine compositions, and mixing with inhibitors. Meanwhile, comprehensive modeling and prediction of scale formation has remained challenging due to the complexity of the geochemical reactions that occurs in real fields. For the first time and to overcome the lack of comprehensive geochemical-based tools, a robust, accurate, and flexible coupled reservoir and wellbore model is developed, and then, integrated with a geochemical tool (i.e. IPhreeqc) to predict scale formation from injection wells through the reservoir to production wells. IPhreeqc, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) geochemical tool, has the capability of modeling homogenous and heterogeneous, reversible and irreversible, and ion-exchange reactions under non-isothermal, non-isobaric, and local equilibrium or kinetic conditions. In this work, by integrating IPhreeqc with the compositional reservoir (UTCOMP) and wellbore simulator (UTWELL), the geochemical capabilities of IPhreeqc is used in a multi-physics reservoir/wellbore models for comprehensive prediction of carbonates and sulfates scales deposition. Moreover, the effects of weak acids and hydrocarbon phase dissolution in the aqueous phase were included to accurately predict the carbonate scale profile. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive simulator available in the industry through which scale deposition in the reservoir and wellbore can be predicted accurately. In this paper, scale deposition profile in the field is estimated by including 1) the interaction of the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases and its effect on the aqueous-scale geochemistry 2) effects of parameters that vary greatly in the field (i.e. pressure, temperature, and pH) and 3) comprehensive geochemistry simulation (provided through coupling of the simulators with IPhreeqc). The outcome of this study yields a comprehensive tool for prediction of scale deposition profile and will help scale deposition risk management and mitigation plans. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents an improved numerical model to predict the onset of reservoir souring in sea-water injected reservoirs. The model is developed to study the effect of temperature, salinity, and pH on the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), which are responsible for hydrogen sulfate generation. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of the environmental factors on the prediction of reservoir souring. First, we model the mechanisms involved in reservoir souring and then identify the parameters that have the crucial effects on the prediction. Previous models assumed that the maximum growth rate is independent and represented by a constant value. They also neglected the competition between different types of substrates. Therefore, we introduce a new mathematical model to express the maximum growth rate of SRB as a function of temperature, salinity, and pH in the first-order Monod kinetics equation. Then, we discuss the modeling of the competition between different types of substrates. Finally, we implement the model into a 3D finite difference non-isothermal reservoir simulator. The new model results are compared to previous model results and validated against experimental data. Next, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to show the effect of temperature, salinity, and pH on bacterial growth and the prediction of souring in a numerical reservoir (or core) model. Taking the effect of environmental parameters into account shows the deficiency of previous models to estimate the reservoir souring. Previous models underestimate the concentration of hydrogen sulfate generation per mass of biodegraded substrate (H2S generation coefficient). The results suggest that the hydrogen sulfide concentration increases as the reservoir temperature, salinity, and pH reach the optimum temperature, pH, and salinity required for SRB to reach its maximum growth rate. The present work differs from earlier works by explicitly determining parametric values required for a kinetic model. This model is as an effective approach to accurately predict the concentration of hydrogen sulfide and thus facilitating accurate decisions on remedial actions. "

                    "abstract": "The conventional interpretation of production logs (PL) acquired in time-lapse mode helps petrophysicists to detect the advancement of fluid contacts in the near-borehole region. Without inclusion of a dynamic reservoir model, conventional time-lapse interpretation remains limited to describing time variations of fluid inflow rates produced from or injected into fluid-producing rock formations. However, proper reservoir management requires quantifying depth variations of near-borehole properties (e.g., formation damage and fluid saturation) over time to construct reliable field-scale reservoir models. This paper develops a new borehole-formation fluid flow model capable of simulating oil-water production measurements acquired from vertical and deviated boreholes. We implement an iteratively coupling flow algorithm to explicitly interface a borehole fluid flow model to a reservoir multiphase flow simulator. The specific application considered in this study invokes the coupled borehole-formation fluid flow model to estimate near-borehole permeability and water saturation from time-lapse oil-water production measurements. Borehole fluid flow simulation is based on an isothermal two-fluid formulation that applies separate mass and momentum conservation equations to the oil and water phases. When solving momentum conservation equations, we compute interfacial drag and buoyant forces based on the assumption of spherical oil or water droplets with negligible interfacial mass transfer. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of droplet diameter associated with the discontinuous fluid phase is dynamically modified to accurately account for variations of slip velocity across fluid-producing layers. Linkage of the borehole and formation fluid flow models is next carried out by introducing additional source terms into the borehole mass conservation equations. In a synthetic reservoir model supported by an infinite-acting aquifer, the coupled flow algorithm integrates production logs acquired in time-lapse mode to construct a near-borehole reservoir model that describes depth variations of skin factor over the elapsed time. Feasibility studies show that the estimated petrophysical properties can be adversely influenced by the large volume of investigation associated with PL measurements. Moreover, undetectable fluid production across low-permeability layers decreases the sensitivity of production logs to layer incremental flow rate, thus increasing estimation uncertainty. Despite these limitations, estimated fluid saturation and permeability across high-permeability layers are within 15% and 20% of the corresponding actual values, respectively. The developed interpretation algorithm additionally integrates well logs and production logs acquired in an oil-water field example to construct a PL-calibrated near-borehole reservoir model. Results enable (a) the differentiation of low-permeability layers from highly-damaged formations, (b) the identification of layers accountable for high water production, and (c) the quantification of the added value of remedial workover operations to isolate water-producing layers. In addition, the coupled model is used to study sensitivity of production logs to near-borehole petrophysical properties. We show that production logs are mainly sensitive to formations’ absolute and relative permeabilities, water saturation, and pressure. "

                    "abstract": "Water management in mature waterflooded reservoirs is a top priority to push more oil out and control water production. Excess water production through fractures and high permeability thief zones is a growing concern for sweep efficiency and oil production. Gel treatment has been applied widely to plug thief zones and reduce excess water production to improve macroscopic sweep efficiency. Field studies demonstrated that gel treatments can be applied successfully in mature and fractured reservoirs to reduce unwanted fluid production to lower the operating cost causing premature well abandonment. The primary objectives of this work are to conduct laboratory work to understand the transport and propagation of microgel and develop a conformance control reservoir simulator to help screen oil reservoir targets for effective particle gel applications to improve sweep efficiency and reduce water production. These microgels can be injected as suspension in water into an injection well. Many experiments were performed to understand the transport mechanism of microgels through porous media and to identify the control variables. The lab data include oil recovery, water-cut, resistance factor, residual resistance factor, oil viscosities, gel concentrations, salinity, gel rheology, and gel strength. The success of gel treatment depends on the magnitude of permeability reduction and flow diversion. We have developed correlations for resistance factor, residual resistance factor and apparent viscosity as a function of gel strength, gel concentration, rock permeability, salinity, and flow rate. The models are validated against lab measurements and implemented into a reservoir simulator called UTGEL. Gel properties such as rheology and adsorption are also investigated. The mechanistic models and numerical tools developed will help select future conformance control candidates for a given field and optimize the gel chemistry and treatment. "

                    "abstract": "CO2 storage is a process in which CO2 is injected into depleted oil and gas reservoirs or deep aquifers to store CO2 through several mechanisms. Since supercritical CO2 phase and saline brine are immiscible at a wide range of pressure and temperature in a permeable medium, capillary pressure exists between the CO2 and saline brine. Although there have been many efforts to study solubility of CO2 in brine aquifers, the most published models neglect the capillary pressure effect during phase behavior calculations to investigate the amount of dissolution trapping. This work focuses on effects of capillary pressure and salinity on solubility of CO2 in the region, where brine saturation increases from a dried zone and/or below residual saturation toward a 100% water saturated zone at the transition zones of CO2 saturations. For this purpose, we developed a new model accounting for inequalities of aqueous and gas phase pressures to calculate the solubility of CO2 in the brine phase. Peng-Robinson equation of state and criterion for local equilibrium are applied. The capillary pressure is a function of phase saturation. We verified the proposed method against the experimental measurement. Subsequently, we performed the case studies including the capillary pressure effect on the solubility of CO2, water vaporization and K-values. The results indicate that increasing capillary pressure leads to a reduction in CO2 solubility. The importance of this effect on CO2 solubility depends on the capillary pressure curve which represents petrophysical properties. In a case considered in this paper, the decrease of CO2 solubility is 23% when the capillary pressure increases from 0.48 to 9.45 MPa. Additionally, effects on equilibrium constant (K-values) and water vaporization were also investigated in the presence of capillary pressure, which can be used to obtain accurate simulation results in commercial reservoir simulators. Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of salinity on CO2 solubility and compared the results with and without the capillary equilibrium. Comparisons between different salinities reveal that CO2 solubility decreases nearly 49% when the salinity increases from 0 to 4 mol aqueous NaCl solutions. It is the first attempt to theoretically investigate the capillary pressure effect on the subject of CO2 geological storage. "

                    "abstract": "Gas adsorption, stress dependence, non-Darcy flow, and surface diffusion of the adsorbed layer are significant mechanisms in shale-gas reservoirs. However, the volume occupied by the adsorbed layer is generally overlooked by current industry standards and numerical models. In addition, stress dependence of matrix pores does not draw as much attention as hydraulic fractures, and surface diffusion has not been included in commercial simulators. Moreover, all these effects significantly affect each other, which can lead to additional complexity of gas transport and production. Therefore, development of an integrative model with consideration of these complicated mechanisms is needed. In this paper, we develop such a fully coupled model for shale-gas-reservoir simulations. We present the derivation of models reflecting the time-dependence effects of gas adsorption/desorption upon original gas in place (OGIP) and petrophysical properties. In particular, both the Langmuir and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) (Brunauer et al. 1938) isotherms are included by use of a unified formula. Surface diffusion of adsorbed layer is also added to this model on the basis of rigorous derivation. More features, such as non-Darcy flow and stress dependence in matrix, natural fractures, hydraulic fractures, and leakage effect between matrix and natural fractures, are incorporated. After that, we present an implicit numerical algorithm to solve the model. Numerical simulations were performed in both 1D and 3D cases and compared with two sets of experimental data and three sets of production data in Marcellus and Barnett shale-gas fields. The simulations indicated that the new simulator cannot only lead to consistent results with these data, but also gives an accurate estimation of OGIP, which traditional models failed to do. It is noted that the model parameters we used for the simulations were close to the values suggested by the literature, if available. By use of this validated simulator, we demonstrated applications with respect to real shale reservoirs, studied the effects of the model parameters upon the gas transport and production, and achieved a variety of new insights.

Coexistence of hydrocarbon fluids with water in production wells yields a complex flow system that requires a three-phase flow model for better characterizing the flow and analyzing measured downhole data. In the past few decades, many researchers and commercial developers in the petroleum industry have aggressively expanded development of robust multiphase flow models for the wellbore. However, many of the developed models apply homogeneous-flow models with limited assumptions for slippage between gas and liquid bulks or use purely two-fluid models. In this paper, we propose a new three-phase flow model that consists of a two-fluid model between liquid and gas and a drift-flux model between water and oil in the liquid phase. With our new method, we improve the simplifying assumptions for modeling oil, water, and gas multiphase flow in wells, which can be advantageous for better downhole flow characterization and phase separations in gravity-dominated systems. Furthermore, we developed semi-implicit and nearly implicit numerical algorithms to solve the system of equations. We discuss the stepwise-development procedures for these methods along with the assumptions in our flow model. We verify our model results against analytical solutions for the water faucet problem and phase redistribution, field data, and a commercial simulator.

                    "abstract": "Interpretation of two-phase production logs (PLs) traditionally constructs borehole fluid-flow models decoupled from the physics of reservoir rocks. However, quantifying formation dynamic petrophysical properties from PLs requires simultaneous modeling of both borehole and formation fluid-flow phenomena. This paper develops a novel transient borehole/formation fluid-flow model that allows quantification of the effect of formation petrophysical properties on measurements acquired with production-logging tools (PLTs). We invoke a 1D, isothermal, two-fluid formulation to simulate borehole fluid-phase velocity, pressure, volume fraction, and density in oil/water-flow systems. The developed borehole fluid-flow model implements oil-dominant and water-dominant bubbly flow regimes with the inversion point taking place approximately when the oil volume fraction is equal to 0.5. Droplet diameter is dynamically modified to simulate interfacial drag effects, and to effectively account for variations of slip velocity in the borehole. Subsequently, a new successive iterative method interfaces the borehole and formation fluid-flow models by introducing appropriate source terms into the borehole fluid-phase mass-conservation equations. The novel iterative coupling method integrated with the developed borehole fluid-flow model allows dynamic modification of reservoir boundary conditions to accurately simulate transient behavior of borehole crossflow taking place across differentially depleted rock formations. In the case of rapid variations of near-borehole properties, frequent borehole/formation communication inevitably increases the computational time required for fluid-flow simulation. Despite this limitation, in a two-layer reservoir model penetrated by a vertical borehole, the coupling method accurately quantifies a 14% increase of volume-averaged oil-phase relative permeability of the low-pressure layer caused by through-the-borehole cross-communication of differentially depleted layers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the alteration of near-borehole petrophysical properties primarily depends on formation average pressure, fluid-phase density contrast, and borehole-deviation angle. A practical application of the new coupled fluid-flow model is numerical simulation of borehole production measurements to estimate formation average pressure from two-phase selective-inflow-performance (SIP) analysis. This study suggests that incorporating static (shut-in) PL passes into the SIP analysis could result in misleading estimation of formation average pressure. "

Although numerous pressure tests have proven the existence of well interference, relatively few physical models exist to quantitatively simulate the pressure response of well interference. The objective of the present study is to develop a numerical, compositional model in combination with an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) to simulate well interference. Through non-neighboring connections, the EDFM can properly handle complex fracture geometries such as non-planar hydraulic fractures and a large amount of natural fractures. Based on public data for Eagle Ford shale oil, we build a reservoir model including up to three horizontal wells and five fluid pseudocomponents. The simulation results show that the connecting hydraulic fractures play a more important role than natural fractures in declining bottomhole pressure (BHP) of the shut-in well. Matrix permeability has a relatively minor impact on pressure drawdown and well productivity remains little affected due to the overall low permeability used. The BHP pressure decline profiles change from convex to concave when the conductivity of the connecting fractures increases. At early times, the BHP of the shut-in well decreases when the number of natural fractures increases. At later times, the natural fracture density has a lesser impact on the pressure response and no clear trend. The opening order of neighboring wells affects the well interference intensity between the target shut-in well with the surrounding wells. After a systematic investigation of pressure drawdown in the reservoir we formulate practical conclusions for improved production performance. "

In previous publications on this subject, the usefulness of implementing the diffusivity equation in conjunction with information from well logs to estimate geopressure in conventional and complex unconventional geological scenarios was demonstrated. In this new study, a novel approach is applied to characterize reservoir and fracture pressures along the horizontal section of a well drilled in the Southwest part of the Eagle Ford unconventional shale play. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no report of estimation of pore pressure in a horizontal wellbore using theoretical principles, such as the diffusivity theory. The recorded rock properties from LWD along the horizontal section of the well serve multiple purposes. Firstly, they were introduced into the solution of the diffusivity equation as “normalized values” to obtain the pore pressure distribution. Secondly, they are employed to generate a synthetic acoustic log along the horizontal section of the wellbore to determine geomechanical properties of Eagle Ford formation. The results documented in this work demonstrate that when using this novel methodology, horizontal wells can be characterized in great detail from the standpoint of reservoir pressure and brittleness. This novel approach is effective, reliable, and can help the completion engineer to decide where to allocate the clusters (perforations) to make more efficient the multistage hydraulic fracturing jobs and improve productivity. Furthermore, geoscientists, reservoir, and production engineers will benefit from knowing reservoir pressure distribution along the path of the horizontal section of the well in more detail. As a result, a more efficient reservoir characterization is obtained to improve horizontal wellbore performance. "

In this work, we implemented this model in an in-house, three dimensional, compositional reservoir simulator, UTCOMP, using Chin's iterative coupling method. This development integrated a stand-alone geomechanics module based on finite element method with the reservoir simulator, an advantage of our coupling algorithm, and improved our understanding of the production through various enhanced oil recovery processes such as water and CO2 flooding processes previously coded in UTCOMP. Benefiting from the higher time scales of solution variations due to the geomechanics module, we lowered the frequency of calling this computationally expensive module. Also, we reduced the order of the finite element shape functions for displacement from quadratic to linear, which majorly mitigated the high computational cost of our geomechanics studies while we almost maintained the solution accuracy. To validate our implementation, we investigated a primary oil production case and compared the results from UTCOMP with those from two other simulators: (1) CMG software program using different coupling methods; and (2) another pre-validated in-house reservoir simulator, GPAS.

The technique synchronizes the jet drilling and liner running in one trip. The \"through tubing operation\" could create up to 1½–2%-in diameter laterals at a certain degree to the mother well. The paper presents the jet tool characteristics, jet drilling operation based on the optimum lateral design in the aspect of enhanced Coalbed methane recovery. First, we model the fishbones using a semi-analytical method, originally developed to model gas and water two-phase flow in CBM wells with complex fracture networks. Each fishbone lateral is treated as a fracture with flowing properties equivalent to the laterals. This new approach is used to perform sensitivity analysis and optimize the well patterns in terms of gas and water production performance. Then, based on the simulation results, the interior structure of the deflector and jet drilling tools are designed. Additionally, laboratory tests according to field requirements are conducted to further identify the optimal jet drilling tools configurations and jetting conditions. Properly designed, SLSCT drilling could provide a cost effective alternative to the conventional multilateral drilling, and become an attractive substitute or supplement to hydraulic fracturing in CBM wells.

                    "abstract": "Conventional interpretation of production logs (PL) numerically accounts for fluid productivity (or injectivity) of reservoir rocks by constructing simplified reservoir flow models. They describe the contribution of various fluid-producing rock formations into borehole fluid flow without quantitatively estimating formation dynamic properties. This paper interfaces borehole and formation fluid flow models to link formation petrophysical properties to borehole production logs. A new interpretation method is subsequently developed to diagnose and quantify formation near-borehole permeability and gas saturation from gas-oil production measurements acquired in deviated boreholes. The specific application considered in this study invokes a new coupled flow algorithm to simulate pressure-production behavior of individual rock formations in multilayer reservoirs with/without cross-flow. Simulation of borehole fluid flow is performed by solving separate mass and momentum conservation equations specified for each fluid phase. Drag and buoyant forces are assumed as primary sources for interfacial momentum transfer. Based on a flow-regime map introduced by Hasan and Kabir (1988), we dynamically modify interfacial drag terms to account for fluid-phase slip velocity. Under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, an equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model is invoked to simulate borehole fluid-phase interfacial mass transfer. Coupling separate borehole and formation fluid flow models is carried out by introducing appropriate source terms into fluid-phase mass conservation equations. Subsequently, a nonlinear inversion-based algorithm estimates near-borehole permeability and gas saturation by minimizing quadratic differences between measurements of borehole fluid velocity, holdup, and pressure, and their corresponding numerical simulations. In a synthetic multilayer reservoir model with a gas cap, PL interpretation recommends a critical bottom-hole pressure to prevent high gas production because of (i) downward advancement of the gas displacement front, and (ii) released gas from oil solution. The estimation error is less than 20% for near-borehole gas saturation, and less than 25% for near-borehole permeability. However, the reliability of estimations is adversely influenced by conditions of immovable gas saturation in rock formations. Additionally, we examine a field example consisting of a gas-oil sand-shale laminated system where PL interpretation is carried out to quantitatively the investigate inflow performance relationship of individual flowing units. The interpretation method integrates well-log-derived and PL-derived permeabilities to quantify the depth distributions of near-borehole skin factor and gas saturation. The estimated near-borehole reservoir model subsequently quantifies more than 60% reduction of unwanted gas production caused by a gas shut-off remedial operation. "

                    "abstract": "Resistivity logs acquired in hydrocarbon-bearing formations invaded by oil-base mud (OBM) often indicate abnormally high values of mobile water saturation. It is not possible to explain such abnormally high values of water saturation with saturation-height analysis. The common explanation invokes rock wettability alterations due to surfactants included in oil-base mud-filtrate (OBMF). A quantitative study is needed to explain whether the interaction of OBMF surfactants with water-wetted grains can cause a sufficiently large increase in mobile water saturation in the near-wellbore region to affect resistivity logs. In this paper, we use a near wellbore simulator to model the processes of mud-filtrate invasion and ensuing wettability alteration once emulsifiers included in OBMF make contact with grain surfaces. We assume a wettability alteration model in which the degree and type of alteration are governed by the pore-volume concentration of emulsifier in OBMF within the invaded formation. Results indicate surfactants included in OBMF may change the rock's surface wettability from a water-wet to a neutral or oil-wet condition. This behavior causes a fraction of the originally residual pore volume of connate water to become moveable. The radial displacement of movable water by OBMF can give rise to an annulus of water bank, which in turn causes the resistivity annulus. We perform simulations of OBMF invasion into oil and gas saturated formations. Simulated apparent resistivity logs across layers which exhibited shallow invasion showed a reverse OBM effect where deep resistivity was larger than shallow resistivity. "

                    "abstract": "Capillary force is an important factor that limits the efficiency of water flooding by trapping the oil in porous media. High capillarity is caused by high interfacial tension (IFT) between oil and water that leads to a high residual oil saturation. Surfactants are widely used to reduce IFT and significantly mobilize the entrapped oil. However, the surfactants that are injected into a reservoir to lower the IFT several orders of magnitude may not be cost effective. Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) process may potentially address a cost effective alternative to surfactant flooding. In the MEOR process, nutrients and natural bacteria are injected into a reservoir and both indigenous and injected microorganisms are able to react and then generate biosurfactants based on in-situ reactions. Modeling of microbial enhanced oil recovery requires coupling kinetics transport with local equilibrium transport in the presence of the surfactant phase behavior model (i.e. Hand’s rule). In general, reservoir simulators do not model relative chemical reactions that consider the effect of essential environmental parameters such as temperature, salinity, and pH. The main objective of this work is to present first order Monod kinetic equations as a function of temperature, salinity, and pH, which control the biodegradation reactions and microbial growth rate. Furthermore, the impact of biosurfactant adsorption, maximum growth rate, and nutrient concentration are systematically investigated. Also, the effects of environmental factors are implemented in a four-phase chemical flooding reservoir simulator (UTCHEM). Subsequently, the simulator is used to history match a coreflood experimental data to model the contribution of cited parameters on oil recovery. Results show that in-situ biosurfactant generation rates can be thoroughly modeled based on environmental factors IFT can be reduced in a similar manner as surfactants. Simulation results show 10–15% incremental oil recovery using in-situ biosurfactant compared to waterflooding. Moreover, based on the simulation results, nutrient concentration, salinity and temperature are found to be the most significant parameters influencing oil recovery, whereas pH has insignificant effect. The understanding of in-situ biosurfactant generation in a MEOR process, implementing a new environmental model into the simulator, and investigating of various parameters influencing the efficiency of the MEOR process are the key findings of this work.

                    "abstract": "Forecasting water breakthrough is a difficult task to be performed for naturally fractured reservoirs. Modeling flow through natural fractures is computationally intensive for a rigorously refined model. Hence, in many cases, it is not feasible to perform a full-field simulation considering the possibility of fracture reactivation. This work aims at applying a methodology to incorporate the flow through fractures or geomechanically active fractures in a full-field model using a commercial reservoir simulator. This is accomplished by tracking which grid blocks in a model cross the activated fractures followed by the redefinition of interblock transmissibilities. These transmissibilities are calculated using the cubic law that relates fluid flow with the fracture aperture and an average distance between crossed blocks. The methodology is well known as Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) (Moinfar, 2013; Moinfar et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009). An in-house finite element geomechanical simulator, one-way coupled with a commercial reservoir simulator, was used to predict in-situ stresses. The classical Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was employed to calculate fracture shear strength. The natural fracture, or a segment of the fracture, is considered permeable when the applied stress is greater than its shear strength. Various case studies indicate the efficiency and accuracy of the EDFM method in a commercial simulator. In order to demonstrate the accuracy of the method, studies were performed in five spot models, comparing the results to those with a rigorously refined fracture representation. In order to highlight the applicability of the methodology at a field-scale, three reservoir simulation case studies are presented: one comparison with the dual permeability method, one simulation of a giant field, and one simulation coupled with a geomechanical simulator. The results show that the representation of natural fractures in reservoir models may drastically change the production forecast, especially in terms of water production. "

                    "abstract": "Two-phase flow has generally been of more concern in the hydraulic treatment design of shale gas reservoir, especially, during the flowback period. Investigating the gas and water production data is important to evaluate the stimulation effectiveness. We develop a semianalytical model for multi-fractured horizontal wells by incorporating the two-phase flow in both matrix and fracture of the shale-gas wells. We employ the node-analysis approach to discretize the complex fracture networks into a given number of fracture segments, depending on the complexity of fracture system. The two-phase flow is incorporated by iteratively correcting the relative permeability to gas and water phase and capillary pressure for each fracture segment with the fracture depletion. The model is validated by numerical model and field observation. A good match between them was obtained. Then, the early-time gas and water production performance is analyzed using various fracture properties and geometries. A systematic type curves are obtained with the fracture system from simple to complex geometries. The flow regimes that were identified could assist in constraining the fracture geometry and complexity. Additionally, the gas and water decline rates highly depend on the fracture properties such as initial gas saturation in fractures, fracture conductivity, fracture spacing, fracture geometry and connections with natural fracture networks. The improved network fracture conductivity and complexity especially the connections between hydraulic fracture and natural fractures can enhance the gas production and shorten the dewatering time, illustrating that the effective stimulation could facilitate the fractures to clean up more quickly. The gas/water supply from natural fractures and their flow dynamics controlled by two-phase relative permeability effects could be the major reasons for the formation of \"V-shape\" behavior on the plot of gas/ water ratio vs. cumulative gas production. This work, for the first time, extends the semianalytical model from single-phase flow to two-phase flow in shale gas reservoir with complex fracture networks. The method is simple and gridless, but is capable of capturing the complex fracture system and gas/water transport mechanisms. Also, it provides an efficient technique to evaluate the hydraulic fracture treatment design in multi-fractured horizontal wells for shale gas reservoirs at early production times. "

                    "abstract": "Numerical simulation is important to understand and predict the development of oil and gas reservoirs. Existing commercial simulators, such as CMG, ECLIPSE and VIP, have been widely used in the past several decades for their robust performance in computing and scaling. In these reservoir simulators, the fluid flow models are based on Darcy's law or its extended form; the volume of the adsorbed phase or component is overlooked as well. While this is acceptable for conventional oil/gas reservoirs or chemical flooding reservoirs, the gas flow regimes such as slippage flow, transition flow, and molecular-free flow significantly is deviated from Darcy flow for shale gas reservoirs. Besides, a large portion of the gas is stored in the pore in the form of adsorbed gas. If the volume of the adsorbed gas is still overlooked, the volume of free gas and original gas in place (OGIP) will be seriously overestimated. For the above reasons, it is commonly thought that existing commercial simulators could not be ideally used to simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs. Hence, it is desirable to attain a feasible approach to correct the petro-physical properties of shale gas effectively within the commercial simulators, in order that one can use them to accurately simulate the development of shale gas reservoirs. In this paper, we first derived the correction formulas for the bulk porosity, free gas saturation, and connate water saturation used for correcting the disregarded volume of adsorbed gas in commercial simulators. Then, we derived the models of permeability and porosity multipliers in matrix considering gas adsorption/desorption, geomechanics, non-Darcy flow regimes, and diffusion of adsorbed layer. Finally, the above models were used to attain the corrected petro-physical properties for simulating gas production based on the practical properties of shale gas reservoirs using commercial simulators. The validation was performed by comparing the simulation results of commercial simulator with the published mechanism simulator using gas field data. The results show that the simulation results using commercial simulator achieve good agreement with the published mechanism simulator with the corrected petro-physical properties. The corrections of bulk porosity, connate water saturation, and free gas saturation are very essential. The correction formulas for these properties can largely decreases the error of OGIP and the calculated gas production. Both permeability and porosity multipliers are the functions of gas pressure, but they are not a monotone decreasing/increasing function. The gas production may be significantly overestimated or underestimated without consideration of these characteristics of shale gas in different fields. The contributions of different mechanisms are also demonstrated using the commercial simulator. This work can evently solve the issue that existing commercial simulators cannot accurately simulate shale gas production. The researchers can easily use these commercial simulators with these corrected formulas, which is a great progress for modeling the development of shale gas reservoir. "

Injecting Polymer (P), surfactant/polymer (SP), and alkaline/surfactant/polymer (ASP) are techniques for improving sweep and displacement efficiencies with the aim of improving oil production in both secondary and tertiary floods. There has been great interest in chemical flooding recently for different challenging situations. These include high temperature reservoirs, formations with extreme salinity and hardness, naturally fractured carbonates, and sandstone reservoirs with heavy and viscous crude oils. More oil reservoirs are reaching maturity where secondary polymer floods and tertiary surfactant methods have become increasingly important. This significance has added to the industry's interest in using reservoir simulators as tools for reservoir evaluation and management to minimize costs and increase the process efficiency. Reservoir simulators with special features are needed to represent coupled chemical and physical processes present in chemical EOR processes. The simulators need to be first validated against well controlled lab and pilot scale experiments to reliably predict the full field implementations. The available data from laboratory scale include 1) phase behavior and rheological data; and 2) results of secondary and tertiary coreflood experiments for P, SP, and ASP floods under reservoir conditions, i.e. chemical retentions, pressure drop, and oil recovery. Data collected from corefloods are used as benchmark tests comparing numerical reservoir simulators with chemical EOR modeling capabilities such as STARS of CMG, ECLIPSE-100 of Schlumberger, REVEAL of Petroleum Experts. The research UTCHEM simulator from The University of Texas at Austin is also included since it has been the benchmark for chemical flooding simulation for over 25 years. The results of this benchmark comparison will be utilized to improve chemical design for field-scale studies using commercial simulators. The benchmark tests illustrate the potential of commercial simulators for chemical flooding projects and provide a comprehensive table of strengths and limitations of each simulator for a given chemical EOR process. Mechanistic simulations of chemical EOR processes will provide predictive capability and can aid in optimization of the field injection projects. The objective of this paper is not to compare the computational efficiency and solution algorithms; it only focuses on the process modeling comparison. "

The original framework of a chemical reservoir simulator is used to implement the model. This model represents a new method to couple the black-oil model with surfactant-phase behavior [i.e., the Hand (1939) rule]. The Hand (1939) rule is used to capture the equilibrium among surfactant, oil, and water species as a function of salinity and species concentrations for oil/water/ME phases. The interphase-mass transfer between gas/oil in the presence of the ME phase is calculated at the equilibrium between phases. For this purpose, a new volume-balance equation is derived to consider the pressure equation for compressible and real mixing in such a model. Hence, the pressure equation is derived by extending the black-oil model to a pseudocompositional model for a wide range of components (water, oil, surfactant, polymer, anion, cation, alcohol, and gas). Mass-balance equations are then solved for the components to calculate the concentration. Finally, we implemented the coupled surfactant and black-oil phase-behavior models and the fluid-flow formulations in an implicit-pressure/explicit-concentration (IMPEC) chemical-flooding simulator: UTCHEM (2011) four-phase. The results were verified against existing reservoir simulators for two different three-phase test cases comprising gas/oil/water and oil/water/ME. Then, the performance of the model in the presence of four phases was tested and validated against coreflood experimental data. The results showed that the new phase behavior and the fluid-flow equations are consistent with three-phase reservoir simulators for the case studies. In addition, the findings of this work can be used to model and capture the mechanisms behind processes such as micellar slug foam and alkaline and surfactant flooding into saturated (gas cap) reservoirs as well as alternating or coinjection of surfactant and gas processes. Modeling of such processes is far from satisfactory in existing phase behavior and fluid-flow simulators. "

In reality, a nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability is created during the hydraulic-fracturing process. However, it is challenging to simulate well performance from the nonplanar fracture geometry. For the sake of simplicity, the nonplanar fracture geometry is often represented by ideal planar fracture geometry with constant fracture width, which one can easily handle analytically, semianalytically, and numerically. However, such ideal fracture geometry is inadequate to capture the physics of the transient flow behavior of the nonplanar fracture geometry. Although significant efforts were made in recent years to numerically model well performance from the complex fracture geometry, these approaches are still challenging to model the nonplanar fracture geometry with varying width because of large considerable fracture-gridding issues and an expensive computation cost. In addition, the effect of nonplanar fracture geometry on well productivity and transient flow behavior was not reported in the literature. Hence, a model to handle the nonplanar fracture geometry by considering varying fracture width and fracture permeability is still lacking in the petroleum industry. Zhou et al. (2014) proposed a semianalytical model to handle the complex fracture geometry with constant fracture width. However, the semianalytical model did not consider the effects of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying fracture width along the fracture. In this work, we extended the semianalytical model to simulate production from the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying width. In addition, the effect of stress-dependent fracture conductivity was implemented in the model. We verified the semianalytical model against a numerical reservoir simulator for single planar fracture with constant width. We performed two case studies. The first case contains a comparison of two planar fractures, one with constant fracture width and another with varying fracture width. In the second study, we compared two fractures with different fracture geometries such as planar fracture geometry and nonplanar fracture geometry, which were generated from the fracture-propagation model. In addition, transient flow regimes were investigated on the basis of a log-log graph of the dimensionless pressure drop and pressure-drop derivative vs. the dimensionless time. This work can provide critical insights into understanding the well performance from tight oil reservoirs with the nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry. "

Different optimization schemes were introduced to minimize the effects of geologic parameters and to improve the performance and the economics of surfactant floods. The simulations were carried out by use of horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoirs. The results show that one can perform gravity-stable surfactant floods at a reasonable velocity and with very-high sweep efficiencies for reservoirs with high vertical permeability. These simulations were carried out with a 3D fine grid and a third-order finite-difference method to accurately model fingering. A sensitivity study was conducted to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and well spacing. The simulations were performed with realistic surfactant properties on the basis of laboratory experiments. The critical velocity for a stable surfactant flood is a function of the microemulsion (ME) viscosity, and it turns out there is an optimum value that one can use to significantly increase the velocity and still be stable. One can optimize the salinity gradient to gradually change the ME viscosity. Another alternative is to inject a low-concentration polymer drive following the surfactant slug (without polymer). Polymer complicates the process and adds to its cost without a significant benefit in most gravity-stable surfactant floods, but an exception is when the reservoir is highly layered. The effect of an aquifer on gravity-stable surfactant floods was also investigated, and strategies were developed for minimizing its effect on the process. "

The proposed model was used to history match recently published corefloods by use of the UTCHEM (2000) mechanistic reservoir simulator. Moreover, other sets of corefloods were chosen to validate the proposed LSWI mechanistic model. The geochemical model in the UTCHEM simulator was modified to calculate the molar Gibbs free energy of the brine. In the proposed LSWI mechanistic model, the relative permeability curves, including the residual oil saturation (ROS), are functions of the molar Gibbs free energy. Coreflood experiments were simulated and history matched by use of the proposed model. The proposed LSWI mechanistic model was further extended to include weakly oil-wet to mixed-wet carbonate rocks. The mechanistic model captures the effects on oil recovery of both wettability alteration and/or dissolution/fines migration through changes in the molar Gibbs free energy.

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing of the Marcellus Shale produces wastewaters that are hypersaline and highly enriched in isotopes of radium. Radium is understood to derive from the Marcellus Shale itself, but its source phases and their contributions to wastewater production have not been described. Using sequential extractions and experimental leachates, we characterize two distinct end-members that could contribute Ra to wastewaters, (1) a mineral phase, which hosts labile228Ra and has 226Ra/228Ra atom ratios ~250, and (2) an organic phase, which hosts exchangeable226Ra and has 226Ra/228Ra ~10,000. In leaching experiments we observed rapid extraction of Ra from these phases, with high ionic strength solutions leaching up to 14% of Ra from the shale in just hours. Radium concentrations and 226Ra/228Ra ratios increase with [Ca2+] of the leaching solution, and solutions approaching 1 M Ca2+ produce 226Ra/228Ra ratios compatible with Marcellus wastewaters. In contrast, pure water removes <0.5% of Ra from the shale with low 226Ra/228Ra ratios incompatible with wastewaters. Experimental results and wastewater data together provide a coherent picture, that the distinctive Ra isotopic signature of Marcellus wastewaters results from contemporaneous water-rock interactions that promote desorption of 226Ra from organics during hydraulic fracturing.

                    "abstract": "Radium in hydraulic fracturing wastewaters derives from two isotopically distinct end-members in the shale, labile 228Ra phase hosted by mineral surfaces (226Ra/228Ra atom ratio ~250) and exchangeable 226Ra hosted by organic surfaces (226Ra/228Ra ~10,000). Here we use mass balance and isotope mixing models to reconcile extraction of Ra from these phases with mechanisms of Marcellus wastewater production. Radium isotopic mass balance requires that the characteristic water-rock ratio between wastewater and shale is exceedingly low, on the order of 0.04, and that this ratio decreases with time during wastewater production. An evolving water-rock interaction drives increasing Ra concentration (=[Ra]) and 226Ra/228Ra ratios during wastewater production, mediated by increasing [Ca2+] that favors desorption of 226Ra from organics. Our observations and models of Ra isotope geochemistry are best reconciled with observations of water and salinity mass balance, δ18O, Na-Br-Cl, and 87Sr/86Sr if wastewater is produced by mixing of injected fluids with a limited volume of pore brine (on the order of 13% by volume), accompanied by contemporaneous extraction of excess alkaline earth elements by water-rock exchange. Validated using Ra isotope data, this model attributes the extreme salinity and [Ra] in wastewaters to the progressive, hydrologic enrichment of injected fluids during hydraulic fracturing. "

                    "abstract": "The placement of proppants in a hydraulic fracture is governed by slurry flow, proppant transport and settlement. The proppant distribution can significantly affect the conductivity of the hydraulic fracture, and hence will impact the productivity of hydraulic fractured wells. Past studies have investigated fracture closure on proppants by envisioning hydraulic fractures as two parallel plates with uniformly distributed proppants. However, in reality, hydraulically induced fractures are wider in the middle and narrower near the fracture edges. In addition, a proppant dune is likely to be accumulated at the bottom of the fracture because of proppant settling. As a result, fracture closure on proppants is controlled by both fracture geometry and the distribution of proppant in the fracture. This is a dynamic process where fracture geometry and the proppant pack will evolve as a function of pressure, and the associated surface contact problem is notoriously challenging to solve because of its nonlinear and nonlocal nature. In this study, we proposed a general approach to model hydraulic fracture closure. The residual fracture width profile for both propped and un-propped sections can be obtained at different drawdown pressures for rocks with different clay content. The maximum stress acting on proppants can be calculated to guide the selection of proppants with appropriate strength. Most importantly, the effect of stress concentration and stress amplification can be quantified when a proppant dune or bank is formed. We also show that the traditional method of estimating the maximum stress on a proppant pack is an underestimation. "

                    "title": "A new method to calculate slurry distribution among multiple fractures during fracturing and refracturing",
                    "abstract": "An accurate calculation of slurry distribution among multiple perforation clusters is necessary for all multi-fracture simulators. The slurry distribution was solved by applying the Newton-Raphson Method in the past. This method requires a numerical evaluation of the Jacobian matrix and can be unstable in some cases. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate slurry distribution among multiple fractures, the Resistance Method. This new approach is computationally efficient, requires no Jacobian matrix calculation, and has been proved to converge locally at least linearly. The Resistance Method is derived by reforming the mass conservation and pressure continuity equations for multiple fractures into a system of nonlinear fixed-point iteration equations. In the new equation system, the fracture resistance is defined as the pressure drop per unit flow rate. And the injected slurry is distributed among multiple fractures in inverse proportion to the resistance of each fracture. This new slurry distribution method has been applied to several different fracture models. The convergence of this new slurry distribution method has been analyzed with the map contraction theory. In this paper, we show three example applications of the Resistance Method. First, the Resistance Method is implemented with an analytical PKN model, with direct comparison made with the Newton-Raphson method. Simulation results show that both methods solve the slurry distribution accurately, but we show that the Resistance Method can be more computationally efficient than the Newton-Raphson Method. Second, the Resistance Method is used to obtain the proppant distribution in multiple clusters with particle transport efficiency curves implemented implicitly. It is shown that the proppant distribution among multiple clusters can be quite different from the fluid distribution. Due to inertial effects, proppant tends to accumulate towards the toe side clusters and causes pre-mature screen-out, resulting in a heel-biased treatment. Third, the Resistance Method is used in a refracturing example problem. A synthetic refracturing treatment with 50 existing fractures, 49 new clusters and about 15 h' treatment time was simulated. The results show that the refrac treatment is heel biased with the 20 heel side clusters receiving most of the treatment and that both existing fractures and new perforations propagate during refracturing. In such simulations extending over long periods of injection and with a large number of perforation clusters it is important to have a very efficient solver to obtain the fluid and proppant distribution in a reasonable computational time frame. In this work, we developed a new method to calculate slurry distribution among multiple clusters with applications to fracturing and refracturing treatments. This new method can be integrated with any fracture model. The main advantages of this new approach include: 1) simple implementation, 2) no numerical evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, 3) computationally efficiency, and 4) easy integration of slurry distribution, proppant transport, stress shadow effects and multiple fracture propagation.

Important CO2-foam properties such as local foam generation, bubble texture, apparent viscosity and shear-thinning behavior with a nonionic surfactant were evaluated using Pore-to-Core upscaling to develop accurate numerical tools for field pilot prediction of increased sweep efficiency and CO2 utilization. On pore-scale, silicon-wafer micromodels showed in-situ foam generation and stable liquid films over time during static conditions. Intra-pore foam bubbles corroborated apparent foam viscosities measured at core-scale. CO2-foam apparent viscosity was measured at different rates (foam rate scans) and different gas fractions (foam quality scans) at core-scale. The highest mobility reduction (foam apparent viscosity) was observed between 0.60-0.70 gas fraction. The maximum foam apparent viscosity was 44.3 (±0.5) mPas, 600 times higher than that of pure CO2. The maximum apparent viscosity for the baseline (reference case, without surfactant) was 1.7 (±0.6) mPas, measured at identical conditions. CO2-foam showed shear-thinning behavior with approximately 50% reduction in apparent viscosity when the superficial velocity was increased from 1 ft/day to 8 ft/day. "

                    "abstract": "Produced water in the oilfield contains oil droplets in the form of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions. These oil droplets cannot be completely separated from the water by surface facilities, and produced water still containing suspended emulsions is re-injected into formations. These oil droplets plug the pore space in the near-wellbore or near-fracture region, resulting in rapid declines in the performance of water injection wells where the remediation processes can be expensive. Displaced oil droplets also contribute to the plugging of pore space near injection wells. These oil droplets are generated by high-velocity flow displacing residual oil in the rock. Because generation and filtration processes occur simultaneously, it is critical to understand both processes at high-velocity flow conditions. This paper experimentally quantifies the rate of generation and filtration of oil droplets in high-velocity flow. For the first time, empirical models were suggested to predict droplet size and rate of generation as a function of trapping number. For the filtration, synthetic dilute O/W emulsions were injected into granular packs to measure the filtration coefficient at various trapping numbers, grain sizes, and fluid velocities. We compared the measurements with known models. Also, filtration mechanisms of straining and interception are explained under high-velocity flow conditions experienced near injection wells. Based on this work, a macroscopic material balance model of O/W emulsion flow in porous media can precisely predict the near-well formation damage and the subsequent performance of injection wells during produced water re-injection (PWRI).

We show that fractures propagate through test specimens in a gradual manner when induced by glycerin at various injection rates. In contrast, nitrogen injection induces instantaneous fractures, which we attribute to its compressible nature and ultralow viscosity. The specimen breakdown pressure is also shown to be markedly lower for nitrogen fractures compared to glycerin fractures. The significantly higher pore pressure distribution and induced tensile stresses associated with nitrogen injection are demonstrated through numerical simulations of the laboratory experiments. Moreover, an experimental evidence of fluid lag when fractures are induced with viscous fluids is provided. "

                    "abstract": "A CO2 foam enhanced oil recovery (EOR) field pilot research program has been initiated to advance the technology of CO2 foam for mobility control in a heterogeneous carbonate reservoir. Increased oil recovery with associated anthropogenic CO2 storage is a promising technology for mitigating global warming as part of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Previous field tests with CO2 foam report various results due to injectivity problems and the difficulty of attributing fluid displacement specifically to CO2 foam. Thus, a more integrated multiscale methodology is required for project design to further understand the connection between laboratory and field scale displacement mechanisms. Foam is frequently generated in a reservoir through the injection of alternating slugs of surfactant solution and gas (SAG). To reduce costs and increase the success of in-situ foam generation, SAG operations must be optimized for field implementation. This study presents an integrated upscaling approach for designing a CO2 foam field trial, including pilot well selection criteria, comprehensive laboratory coreflood experiments combined with reservoir scale simulation to offer recommendations for a SAG injection schedule while assessing CO2 storage potential. Laboratory investigations include dynamic aging, foam stability scans, CO2 foam EOR corefloods with associated CO2 storage, and unsteady state CO2/water endpoint relative permeability measurements. Wettability tests of restored reservoir core material yield Amott-Harvey index values of −0.04 and −0.79, indicating weakly oil wet to oil wet conditions. Foam scans demonstrate highest foam quality at gas fraction (fg) of 0.70. CO2 foam EOR corefloods after completed waterfloods, at optimal foam quality, result in a total recovery factor of 80% OOIP with an incremental recovery of 35% OOIP by CO2 foam. A negligible difference is observed in incremental CO2 foam recoveries and apparent viscosities when using 1 wt% and 0.5wt% surfactant solution. High differential pressures during CO2 foam suggest generation of stable foam with mobility reduction factors by CO2 foam up to 340, over CO2 at reservoir conditions. CO2 storage potential was assessed during displacement to investigate the carbon footprint of CO2 foam injection. Relative permeability endpoints and foam stability scan parameters are input into a validated field scale numerical simulation model to recommend design parameters for SAG injection. The numerical model investigates foam's impacts on oil recovery, gas mobility reduction, producing gas oil ratio (GOR), and CO2 utilization. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of foam to reduce gas mobility, improve CO2 utilization, and decrease GOR. "

                    "abstract": "Plug-and-perforate (Plug-and-Perf) fracturing stages with multiple perforation clusters have become common practice in the industry. However, it is usually unclear whether the fluid and proppant are distributed evenly among all clusters. In this study, we present a method for computing the proppant distribution into each cluster in a fracturing stage. By integrating proppant transport into a multicluster hydraulic-fracturing model and implementing a simple screenout criterion, we show that the proppant distribution in a fracturing stage can be very uneven, with a strong bias toward the heel-side clusters even when the initial fluid distribution is uniform among all clusters. In this work, we define the efficiency of proppant transport into a perforation by the proppant-transport efficiency (PTE), which is defined as the mass fraction of proppant transported through a perforation relative to the total mass of proppant approaching the perforation. The dynamic proppant distribution in a fracturing stage is modeled with the PTE concept in three steps. First, a series of coupled computational-fluid-dynamics/discrete-element-method (CFD/DEM) simulations were performed to obtain PTE under controlled flow conditions. Then, the CFD/DEM simulation results were statistically analyzed to generate a PTE correlation as a function of wellbore, perforation, fluid, and proppant properties. Finally, the PTE correlation was incorporated into a multicluster hydraulic-fracturing model to compute the dynamic distribution of fluid and proppant among multiple clusters in a fracturing stage. Results from this work show that proppant concentration in the toe-side clusters can be several times higher than the injected concentration. This occurs because the high wellbore flow rate near the heel-side clusters provides proppant particles a large inertia sufficient to prevent them from turning into the perforations. Proppant concentration in the wellbore is thus increased as the slurry flows toward the toe side and the fluid preferentially leaks off from the heel-side perforations. The highly concentrated slurry increases the screenout risk of the toe-side clusters. Our modeling results show that if toe-side clusters screen out at early time in the proppant stage, fluid and proppant are redistributed to the heel-side clusters. In such a case, cumulative fluid and proppant distributions will be heel-biased. Simulation results are compared with field observations and are shown to be consistent with distributed-temperature-sensing (DTS) and distributed-acoustic-sensing (DAS) observations on proppant distribution made in three different studies. The method presented in this work provides a way to quantify proppant transport at a wellbore scale. It shows that the uneven proppant distribution among perforation clusters is a function of fluid, perforation, and proppant properties. An estimate of proppant placement in different perforation clusters can be computed for any pumping schedule and wellbore/perforation geometry with this method. This can be used to optimize perforation clusters that will result in a more-even distribution of proppant in each cluster. "

                    "abstract": "A new approach for estimating sand production through gravel packs is presented in this paper. The approach involves two steps: (a) evaluating the pore throat size distribution (PoSD) of a gravel pack and (b) estimating sand production through the gravel pack using an analytical model. Results of the analytical model are compared with sand production data obtained from lab experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. The PoSD of a gravel pack is evaluated using the discrete element method (DEM). The process includes generating a random close packing of gravel based on the gravel particle size distribution (PSD) and evaluating the pore throat size distribution (PoSD) in each layer of the gravel pack. The evaluated gravel pack PoSD is then used to compute the filter efficiency of the pack for various formation sand sizes. Sand production through the gravel pack is predicted analytically by applying the filter efficiency data to any given formation PSD under the assumption that straining is the dominant sand-retention mechanism for a gravel pack. Results from DEM simulations show that the smallest and largest pore throats in a gravel pack are typically sized around 1/9 and 1/4.8 to 1/5.5 of the effective gravel diameter (Deff), respectively. These observations suggest that any formation sand grains larger than 1/5.5 Deff will be retained near the sand-gravel interface, i.e. within 10 layers of gravel from the sand-gravel interface. Furthermore, the gravel pack alone cannot retain any formation sand smaller than 1/9 Deff for a typical thickness of the gravel pack. A secondary pack formed by retained formation sand is essential for effective sand retention in such cases. Increasing gravel packing thickness primarily improves the retention of sand sized between 1/5.5 to 1/9 Deff, and the effect is insignificant for sand out of this size range. Finally, the analytically estimated sand production using DEM-evaluated PoSDs agrees reasonably well with sand production data obtained from lab experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed approach provides a time and cost-efficient way to predict the effectiveness of a gravel pack for any given formation sand size distribution. The approach accounts for the gravel particle size distribution and the thickness of the annular gravel pack. Application of this new approach can improve the reliability of sand control completions by better justifying a gravel design, specifically in reservoir sands with poor uniformity (i.e., high-fines).

                    "abstract": "The shape of fractures in an elastic medium under different stress distributions have been well studied in the literature, however, the fracture closure process during unloading has not been investigated thoroughly. The fracture surface is normally assumed to be perfectly smooth so that only the width and stress intensity at the fracture tip are critical in the analysis. In reality, the creation of a fracture in a rock seldom produces smooth surfaces and the resulting asperities on the fracture surfaces can impact fracture closure. Correctly modeling this fracture closure behavior has numerous applications in structural engineering and earth sciences. In this article, we present an approach to model fracture closure behavior in a 2D and 3D elastic media. The fracture surface displacements under arbitrary normal load are derived using superposition method. The contact stress, deformation, and fracture volume evolution are estimated in a computationally efficient manner for various fracture surface properties. When compared with the traditional integral transform methods used to model fracture closure, the superposition method presented in this study produces comparable results with significant less computation time. In addition, with the aid of parallel computation, large scale fracture closure and contact problems can be successfully simulated using our proposed dynamic fracture closure model (DFCM) with very modest computation times.

                    "abstract": "In this study, a quantitative method is presented for the selection of a choke-management strategy that minimizes the risk of the predominant failure mechanisms in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions. In unconventional resources, an improper choke-management strategy may trigger proppant crushing or the flowback of proppant, resulting in fracture closure and loss of production. In frac packs and high-rate water packs, an abrupt increase in the rate (or drawdown) may induce completion damage, resulting in impaired production and sand production and requiring excessive and costly workovers. Choke-management strategies should aim to minimize near-wellbore pressure gradients along the fracture, thus making proppant flowback and loss of fracture conductivity or connectivity with the wellbore less likely to occur. Choke-management strategies are compared for a wide range of formation and fracture properties, including fluid properties, matrix permeability, fracture conductivity, and fracture length. Results indicate that in unconventional formations (k < 0.01 md) there is a unique choke-management strategy that consistently appears to be the best. The methodology is coupled with previous studies that have focused on determining the critical pressure gradient for which proppant flowback is observed. In frac packs and high-rate water packs, completion failure may occur because of excessive fluid velocities along the frac pack or exaggerated pore-pressure gradients at the completion sandface. Results indicate that the selection of the optimal choke-management strategy is similar to that of openhole completions, with beanup operations achieving a relatively higher reduction in pressure gradients for the case of low values of dimensionless fracture conductivity. The greatest reduction in pressure gradients can be achieved by considering beanup operations during completion design. The results of this study provide, for the first time, a clear methodology for selecting choke-management strategies in hydraulically fractured wells and frac-pack completions for a wide range of reservoir and fluid properties. A general framework for beanup operations is defined and then used to compare beanup strategies for hydraulically fractured and frac-pack completions. It is hoped that this paper will contribute a theoretical foundation to the current diverse operator practices. "

Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of atorvastatin 40 mg vs 80 mg on HDL-C and triglycerides and also comparing of side effects (myopathy, hepatotoxicity and new onset diabetes mellitus) of both doses. This Study is A Prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative study. This study was conducted on 240 patients of dyslipidemia (as per ACC/AHA 2013 lipid guidelines) attending the OPD/wards/CCU of department of cardiology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. They were randomly divided into 2 groups of 120 each. Group A consisted patients who received Atorvastatin 40 mg daily and Group B Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. The follow up period was 6 months. At 3 and 6 month follow up, Atorvastatin 40 mg leads to mean LDL cholesterol reduction of 47.18 ± 20.81 & 50.03 ± 18.06 respectively. While Atorvastatin 80 mg results in LDL reduction as 50.11 ± 15.85 & 52.30 ± 13.72. The comparison between two doses revealed a non-significant difference (p = .118 & p = .149 respectively). At 6 months of follow up, few patients reported myalgia (2 in group A and 7 in Group B). The difference between groups was significant (p = .045). Although none of our patient had significant elevation of CPK. This study concluded that both doses of atorvastatin (40 & 80 mg) are equally efficacious in improving dyslipidemia but higher dose leads to more incidence of myalgia. "

                    "abstract": "A new method is proposed to estimate the compliance and conductivity of induced unpropped fractures as a function of the effective stress acting on the fracture from DFIT data. A hydraulic fracture's resistance to displacement and closure is described by its compliance (or stiffness). Fracture compliance is closely related to theelastic, failure and hydraulic properties of the rock. Quantifying fracture compliance and fracture conductivity under in-situ conditions is crucial in many earth science and engineering applications but very difficult to achieve. Even though laboratory experiments are often used to measure fracture compliance and conductivity, the measurement results are strongly influenced by how the fracture is created, the specific rock sample obtained andthe degree to which it is preserved. As such the results may not be representative of field scale fractures Over the past two decades, Diagnostic Fracture Injection Tests (DFIT) has evolved into a commonly used and reliable technique to obtain in-situ stresses, fluid leak-off parameters and formation permeability. The pressure decline response across the entire duration of a DFIT test reflects the process of fracture closure and reservoir flow capacity. As such it is possible to use this data to quantify changes in fracture conductivity as a function of stress. In this paper we presenta single, coherent mathematical framework to accomplish this. We show how each factor impacts the pressure decline response and the effects of previous overlooked coupled mechanisms are examined and discussed. Synthetic and field case studies are presented to illustrate the method. Most importantly,a new specialized plot (normalized system stiffness plot) is proposed, which not only providesclear evidence of the existence of a residual fracture width as afracture is closing during a DFIT, but also allows us to estimate fracture compliance (or stiffness) evolution and infer un-propped fracture conductivity using only DFIT pressure and time data based on a time-convolution solution. It is recommended that the normalized system stiffness plot be used as a standard practice to complement the G-function or square root of time plotbecause it provides veryvaluable information on the properties of fracture surface roughness at a field-scale, information that cannot be obtained by any other means.

                    "abstract": "During hydraulic fracturing, natural fractures and bedding planes can intersect with growing hydraulic fractures and form complex fracture networks. This can result in the flow of fluid and proppant in convoluted fracture pathways with highly variable fracture width and height. Existing models of hydraulic fracturing assume a planar fracture geometry and are unable to simulate proppant placement in such complex networks. In this work, we investigate proppant transport in growing fracture networks using a fully three-dimensional, geomechanical fracture flow, network model with the ability to simulate proppant transport. A three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator developed using the displacement discontinuity method is coupled with a network model for proppant transport. The simulator captures the effect of proppant concentration, fracture width, and fluid rheology on proppant transport. The equations for the fracture network geomechanics, the fluid flow, and the proppant transport are solved in a coupled manner. This provides an accurate estimation of both the fluid pressure and the proppant distribution as the fracture network grows. The geometry of each fracture segment affects the flow distribution in the network. Simulations are then conducted to study the redistribution of proppant as it settles in the fracture network during shut-in to get the final proppant distribution in the network. It is observed that changes in the in-situ stress due to heterogeneity and the stress-shadow induced near the intersection of a hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture may reduce the fracture width and suppress the ability of the proppant to move into the natural fracture. In low permeability formations, due to low leak-off rates, the proppant almost always forms a proppant bank at the bottom of the fracture during shut-in. For planar fractures, proppant settling may disconnect the conductive proppant bank from the wellbore, isolating the productive propped fracture from the wellbore. This problem is exaggerated in the case of fracture networks, where every intersection point between fractures can potentially act as a bottleneck for the flow of produced hydrocarbons. The increase in the surface area due to hydraulically connected natural fractures increases fluid leak-off, reduces the average width of the fracture network, increases proppant concentration, and increases the likelihood of proppant bridging. This work allows us to improve our understanding of proppant placement in three-dimensional, mechanically interacting, complex fracture networks. By coupling geomechanics with proppant transport in fracture networks, it is now possible to study the impact of the stress shadow on proppant placement in natural fractures. The results will assist in improving hydraulic fracture design for naturally fractured reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "A tool concept using downhole electrical measurements for mapping electrically conductive proppant in hydraulic fractures is presented in this paper. The method relies on direct excitation of the casing, which overcomes the severe limitations of induction tools in cased wellbores. An array of insulating gaps is installed and cemented in place as a permanent part of the casing string. The electrical measurements are done by imposing a voltage across each insulating gap, one at a time, before and after hydraulic fracture operations. The voltages across other insulating gaps near the transmitter gap are recorded. The proposed tool's response to the geometry of a single fracture was modeled by solving for the electrical potential using a finite volume method. Preliminary results have shown that the electrically conductive proppant alters the path of the electrical current in the formation and this is recorded as differential signals by the string of insulating gaps surrounding the source gap. The measured differential signals are highly sensitive to a fracture's location, size, and orientation, and less sensitive to the fracture shape. However, to enable the implementation of such a practical system, various aspects of the tool need to be further investigated. Following our previous work, this paper focuses on forward modeling of the tool's response to multiple fractures, which demonstrates the influence of these fractures to the signals and provides important guidance for inverse modeling. Parametric inversion of fractures from synthetic data, generated by exciting various insulating gaps, is solved by using Very Fast Simulated Annealing (VFSA). Simulation results show that when multiple hydraulic fractures are present, the voltages measured at the receiver gaps are primarily determined by the geometry of the fracture, which is in direct contact with the excited section of casing. When two fractures touch the same casing section, they induce very similar voltages to those from a single fracture with equivalent conductance. Preliminary inversion results from synthetic data indicate that the proposed VFSA can solve for the multiple fractures' conductance and size at the same time, without requiring a large number of forward simulations. Even with noisy synthetic data, VFSA is able to make good estimates of the fractures' geometries. This indicates that the VFSA technique is a proper and robust inversion technique for the measured voltages at various receiver gaps. "

                    "abstract": "In the last few years, several operators in unconventional plays have seen fracture interference between existing production wells (parent wells) and newly fractured infill wells (child wells). This interference usually has a negative impact on the production from both the parent and child wells. In this work, a mechanistic explanation of the parent-child interaction is provided using results from poro-elastic simulations. Child well underperformance is studied in detail and mitigation strategies are discussed. Results shown in this work quantify the impact of depletion and refracturing on child well fracturing. In this work, a 3D reservoir-scale poro-elastic geomechanics software (Multi-Frac) was used to model the depletion of the parent well region and calculate its impact on pressure, total stress and effective stress. Refracturing simulations of the parent well were conducted to showcase the importance of a good refracturing operation in reducing the probability of fracture hits from the child well to the parent well. The poro-elastic capabilities of Multi-Frac help in analyzing the stress changes in the reservoir induced by depletion and re-fracturing. These stress changes explain the observed fracture hits from child wells. The stress changes and the depletion patterns also explain the underperformance of the child well fractures. Implications of depletion on both total stress and effective stress are analyzed. Decrease in the total stress near the parent well creates a zone of attraction for the child well fracture, thus, causing the child well fracture to be created in a region of extensive depletion. Depletion induced increase in the effective stress was observed from the simulation. This increase in the effective stress makes fracture network creation harder and thus reduces the productivity of the child well fractures. Re-fracturing of the parent well showed an increase in the stress in the reservoir and can help avoid fracture hits from neighboring child wells. Thus, re-fracturing a parent well and subsequently fracturing a child well can be a possible strategy to mitigate the impact of fracture hits and thereby improve the EUR of the pad. The three main factors that induce interference between parent wells and child wells are reservoir depletion, reservoir total stress changes and reservoir effective stress changes. All of these factors have been studied and quantified in this work. Modifications to parent well fracturing treatment design, refracturing treatment design and child well fracturing treatment design are suggested to improve productivity. "

Current planar fracture models are inadequate for capturing the effect of natural fractures on fracture propagation and addressing the important question of optimum fracture spacing and well spacing. Stress interference due to three-dimensional fracture networks can result in intricate fracture geometries, which are usually neglected by fracture models. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator that models the deformation and stress fields induced by both the dilation and shear failure of all existing and propagating hydraulic or natural fractures. It is shown that the simulator allows us to capture the complex fracture geometries, and microseismic signatures often observed in heterogeneous and naturally fractured rocks. Fracture geomechanics is modeled in a computationally efficient manner using a fully three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method. The simulator captures the physics of fracture growth, fracture turning, fluid distribution in fracture networks, and the intersection of hydraulic fractures with pre-existing natural fractures. The model captures the interaction between multiple branches of a hydraulic fracture (stress shadow effect). The model also simulates the shear failure of hydraulically disconnected natural fractures to simulate microseismic activity and can account for the effect of shear failure and slippage along bed boundaries and along natural fractures on hydraulic fracture propagation. The effect of pre-existing natural fracture density and orientation on the geometry of the fracture network generated is systematically studied. It is shown that natural fractures play an important role in determining the propagation direction of hydraulic fractures and this effect is quantified. At high natural fracture density, the propagation direction of a hydraulic fracture is dominated by the orientation of natural fractures rather than the far field stress magnitude and direction. The density of the natural fractures also affects the complexity of the final created fracture geometry. "

                    "abstract": "One of the primary particle-retention mechanisms in a filtration process is straining, which happens when the size of a particle is larger than the pore throat trapping it. The occurrence of straining depends on both the particle size distribution (PSD) of the suspension and the pore throat size distribution (PoSD) of the filter, with measurement of the latter being especially difficult. This paper presents a new approach for evaluating the PoSD of a filter medium using a discrete element method (DEM). The approach computes the filter efficiency (FE), defined as the fraction of particles of a certain size retained by the filter, for incremental particle sizes in a filtration process. Special care was taken to turn off the interactions between injected particles in the simulation so that the computed filter efficiencies reflect an incremental sampling of pore throat sizes, and thereby can be used to infer the PoSD. Good agreement was observed between the simulated and theoretical PoSDs in an ideal sieve and a simple cubic packing case. The study showed that for a monodisperse random close packing (RCP) of spherical grains, the largest pore throat is about 1/4.5 of the grain size, and the smallest pore throat is about 1/6.6 of the grain size. For a polydisperse RCP formed by 20–40 mesh grains, the largest pore throat is about 1/5.3 of the effective grain size, and the smallest pore throat is about 1/10 of the effective grain size. The approach can be easily extended to evaluate the PoSD of any type of filter medium, including RCPs with any PSD. The PoSD computed provides essential information for filter layer design and selection. "

However, insufficient injectivity can result in water-injection projects being limited in injection rates, which can sometimes make them uneconomic. Implementing water-injection projects requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize water-injection rates for reservoir-performance, cost, and well-design considerations. The costs for the surface facilities are dependent on the required water quality, water temperature, and other operating parameters that are linked to the injectivity of water. A work flow including quantitative assessment of the injectivity development as a function of the operating parameters as well as the uncertain geomechanical and reservoir parameters can be used to improve the surface-facility design. Such a work flow was applied to a shallow offshore field. The results showed that the base-case design of the facilities should be modified to avoid an increase of the flowing bottomhole pressure (BHP) above the minimum stress of the caprock. The effect of the various parameters on the BHP was investigated, and the sensitivity of the BHP to uncertain input parameters under different operating conditions was tested. The results indicated that the BHP does not exceed the BHP limit, and hence the injectivity is expected to be high enough for a sufficiently long period of time under a wide range of conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Previous experimental observations have shown the formation of distinct failure patterns and cavity shapes under different stress and flow conditions. With isotropic stress, spiral failure patterns with localized shear bands are likely to form. On the other hand, under anisotropic stress, V-shape cavities, dog-ear cavities or slit mode cavities are usually observed. However, the mechanisms for the development of these sanding cavities remain unclear. In addition, in order to accurately predict the onset of sanding and predict the sand production rate, it is crucial to capture the physics of formation of these cavities during sand production. This paper presents a fully coupled poro-elasto-plastic, 3-D sand production model for sand production prediction around open-hole and perforated wellbores in a weakly consolidated formation. Sanding criteria are based on a combination of shear failure, tensile failure and compressive failure from Mohr-Coulomb theory and strain-hardening/softening. Once the failure criteria are met, an algorithm for entrainment of the sand based on the calculation of hydrodynamic forces is implemented to predict sand erosion and transport. Dynamic mesh refinement has been implemented to effectively capture the strain localization regions. The model has been validated with multiple analytical solutions. In addition, it is applied to compare with previous sand production experiments that have explored the different cavity shapes formed under different conditions. The model is capable of not only explaining the mechanisms responsible for each type of cavity shape but also predicting what cavity shape will be formed under a specific set of conditions. Parametric studies for these cases provide additional insight into the important role that the post-yield, poro-elasto-plastic properties of the sand play in controlling the sanding mechanisms and cavity development. This allows us to much more accurately predict the onset of sanding and the sanding rate. "

                    "abstract": "Fluid flow in unpropped and natural fractures is critical in many geophysical processes and engineering applications. The flow conductivity in these fractures depends on their closure under stress, which is a complicated mechanical process that is challenging to model. The challenges come from the deformation interaction and the close coupling among the fracture geometry, pressure, and deformation, making the closure computationally expensive to describe. Hence, most of the previous models either use a small grid system or disregard deformation interaction or plastic deformation. In this study, a numerical model is developed to simulate the stress-driven closure and the conductivity for fractures with rough surfaces. The model integrates elastoplastic deformation and deformation interaction, and can handle contact between heterogeneous surfaces. Computation is optimized and accelerated by use of an algorithm that combines the conjugate-gradient (CG) method and the fast-Fourier-transform (FFT) technique. Computation time is significantly reduced compared with traditional methods. For example, a speedup of five orders of magnitude is obtained for a grid size of 512 × 512. The model is validated against analytical problems and experiments, for both elastic-only and elastoplastic scenarios. It is shown that interaction between asperities and plastic deformation cannot be ignored when modeling fracture closure. By applying our model, roughness and yield stress are found to have a larger effect on fracture closure and compliance than Young’s modulus. Plastic deformation is a dominant contributor to closure and can make up more than 70% of the total closure in some shales. The plastic deformation also significantly alters the relationship between fracture stiffness and conductivity. Surfaces with reduced correlation length produce greater conductivity because of their larger apertures, despite more fracture closure. They have a similar fraction of area in contact as compared with surfaces with longer fracture length, but the pattern of area in contact is more scattered. Contact between heterogeneous surfaces with more soft minerals leads to increased plastic deformation and fracture closure, and results in lower fracture conductivity. Fracture compliance appears not to be as sensitive to the distribution pattern of hard and soft minerals. Our model compares well with experimental data for fracture closure, and can be applied to unpropped or natural fractures. These results are obtained for a wide range of conditions: surface profile following Gaussian distribution with correlation length of 50 µm and roughness of 4 to 50 µm, yield stress of 100 to 1500 MPa, and Young’s modulus of 20 to 60 GPa. The results may be different for situations outside this range of parameters. "

                    "abstract": "It has been shown in controlled laboratory experiments and some field studies that the onset of sand production in gas wells differs from that in oil wells. Results from a general 3-D sand production model are presented to explain the differences in the onset of sanding and sand production volume for different fluids and under different flow and in-situ stress conditions. The sand production model accounts for multi-phase fluid flow and is fully coupled with an elasto-plastic geomechanical model. Sanding criteria considers both mechanical failure and sand erosion by fluid flow. Non-Darcy flow is implemented to account for the high flow rates. The drag forces on the sand grains are computed based on the in-situ Reynolds number. Both the intact rock strength and the residual rock strength depend on water saturation. Water evaporation (drying) due to gas flow is modeled using phase equilibrium calculations. The onset of sand production is compared for different fluid types (oil and gas). Model results are shown to be consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature. For example, the onset of sanding is observed at higher compressive stresses for gas wells as compared to oil wells. Theprimary mechanism for this is for the first time shown to be sand strengthening induced by evaporation of water. This effect is not observed in oil wells. The sand production rate when non-Darcy effectsareconsidered is lower than for Darcy flow. The reason for this is the lower fluid velocity (for the same drawdown) and consequently smaller drag forces on the failed sand grains. The effect of water breakthrough and water cut on sand production is studied from both mechanical and erosional perspectives. The model is shown to be capable of accurately predicting the onset of sanding and sand production induced by multi-phase and compressible fluid flows, helping us to predict sanding issues in both oil and gas wells.

                    "abstract": "Choke management strategies vary significantly among operators and no rigorous methodology exists for properly selecting choke sizes when constraints are placed on completions, wellbores and fluid pressures and velocities. Bringing a well on production too fast may significantly compromise productivity or even result in completion failure with particularly severe implications in offshore developments. Examples of constraints placed on bean-up strategies include, limiting the maximum drawdown to minimize the risk of sanding or proppant crushing. This paper presents a methodology for translating such constraints to the required choke sizes and durations i.e. a specific bean-up strategy that will respect the constraints placed on the system. In this study, we propose a coupled wellbore-reservoir model that performs dynamic nodal analysis using integrated models for surface facilities, wellbore and reservoir simulators and allows an operator to select choke sizes as a function of time. Illustrative examples of the method are shown for a conventional and an unconventional well. Results indicate that the choke schedule strongly depends on both the reservoir and wellbore properties. As a result, empirical and general guidelines should not be used across the board. Instead a quantitative analysis is recommended for a given set of surface, wellbore and reservoir properties to ensure a successful ramp-up. This study provides an integrated and systematic approach for selecting choke sizes for oil and gas wells. "

                    "abstract": "Multilayered metal-mesh screens (MMSs) are widely used as standalone screens for sand control in unconsolidated formations. The nominal rating of such screens is usually determined on the basis of the specifications of the filter layer. It is often found that screens with the same filter-layer nominal rating perform differently. It is shown in this study that the primary reason for this is that the sand-retention performance of multilayered MMSs is a strong function of not only the filter layer but also the protection and the support layers. This paper presents a systematic study that shows how the overlap between different mesh layers, the alignment of the protection and support layers, and the relative pore-size ratio, defined as the ratio of pore size of the protection/support layer to that of the filter layer, have a large impact on the sand-retention performance of an MMS. The pore-size distribution (PoSD) of multilayered plain-square-mesh (PSM) and plain-Dutch-weave (PDW) screens is calculated with a novel numerical technique. Influences of screen sintering, coupon sampling, and screen designs on the PoSD of a screen are modeled by varying the layer overlap, shifting the layer alignment, and modifying the design of the protection and support layers. The PoSD data are used as an input into an analytical model for evaluating sand production of PSM screens in slurry-type sand-retention tests (SRTs) for screen-design optimization. For PSM screens, the results show that the PoSD of a multilayered screen can be very different from the PoSD of the filter layer. In general, a decrease in sand production with an increase in layer overlap is observed; the trend exists irrespective of how mesh layers are aligned. A change in mesh alignment is found to cause a variation in sand production even with the same filter-layer pore size and layer overlap. The nominal rating of the filter layer of a multilayered PSM screen should be used to estimate sand production only when the pore sizes of the protection and support layers are much larger than the pore size of the filter layer. For PDW screens, layer overlap is shown to dominate the screen performance by affecting the filter-layer pore size. The PoSD of a PDW screen is found to be less affected by variations in layer alignment and relative pore-size ratio. This study clearly shows that the layer overlap, layer alignment, and relative pore-size ratio between mesh layers can have a significant impact on the sand-retention performance of a multilayered MMS. As such, widely different screen performances can be expected for screens with the same nominal screen rating. Our results have a direct bearing on how MMSs are manufactured, selected, and specified. Increasing the relative pore-size ratio appears to be a promising screen-design approach for obtaining consistent screen performance for multilayered MMSs. "

Porous test specimens with injection points in different configurations are placed between two transparent plates. Experiments are conducted to examine hydraulic fracture growth in proximity to a constant pressure injection source as well as propagation of multiple neighboring fractures under different injection conditions. The fracturing process is recorded using a high resolution digital camera. A variety of fracture behavior is observed in these experiments that demonstrate the interplay between high pore pressure regions, the applied contrast in far-field stresses, and fluid injection scheme and configuration of injectors. 1. INRODUCTION Changes in pore pressure by fluid injection or production in oil and gas reservoirs can have a significant influence on the magnitude and orientation of in-situ stresses. Initiation and propagation of hydraulic fractures can, therefore, be affected by a perturbation of pore pressure field. Bruno and Nakagawa (1991) performed laboratory experiments in which a hydraulic fracture was propagated from an injection port in thin sandstone slabs under the influence of a nearby fluid injection source maintained at constant pressure. The experiments reported by the authors were performed without applying far-field stresses, i.e. under isotropic far-field stress state. Bouteca et al. (1983) reported an experimental result showing hydraulic linkage between two injection ports that were offset by 10 degrees from an applied maximum far-field stress without reporting the specifics of the experiment. Analytical and numerical evaluation of similar problems were reported by Berchenko and Detournay (1997) and Wang et al. (2013). In this work, we performed an experimental study that examines the effect of pore pressure on hydraulic fracture growth using novel experimental capabilities. A series of tests were performed in a systematic manner under various fluid injection schemes and configurations and varying contrast in the applied far-field stresses. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: The effect of different fluid types and compositions on stress changes around fractured production wells has been studied in detail in this work. A compositional reservoir simulator which is fully coupled with geomechanics was used for this study. Both mechanical effects due to propped fractures and poroelastic effects due to production are considered while calculating stress changes. It was found that highly compressible, low viscosity fluids such as gases result in a lower stress reversal than lesser compressible fluids such as oils. For a volatile oil, the appearance of gas phase when pressure falls below the bubble point, reduces the stress reorientation as compared to not accounting for phase change and assuming a single hydrocarbon phase. The higher the fraction of the most volatile component, the lower is the resulting stress reversal. Similar conclusions are obtained for vertical wells with a single fracture and horizontal wells with multiple fractures. These findings highlight the importance of considering fluid type and composition while designing refracturing jobs based on the modified stress field due to prior production. 1. INTRODUCTION The key to achieving a successful refracturing treatment is stimulating new reservoir volume that has not been drained effectively. Considerable efforts have been made recently to achieve predictable and repeatable results from refracturing due to high decline rates from horizontal wells and low oil prices. Some of these include, identifying role of diverting agents (Fragachan et al., 2015; Leonard et al., 2015), improving candidate well selection (Barree et al., 2017) and modifying the design of the refracture based on stress changes. Stress changes happen around candidate refrac-wells because of (a) mechanical effects due to propped fractures and (b) poroelastic effects due to prior production from the stimulated rock volume. The in-situ stresses, which govern the subsequent fracture growth during refracturing, are thus modified in both magnitude and direction. It has been well established in both modeling (Liu et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2012; Weng and Siebrits, 2007) and field case studies (Wright and Connant, 1995; Ajani and Kelkar, 2012; Warpinski and Branagan, 1989) that mechanical and poroelastic effects modify the insitu stresses and thus determine the direction and geometry of subsequent fracture growth.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Boundary element methods such as the displacement discontinuity method (DDM) are promising for describing the geo-mechanics of growing fractures as they reduce the dimensionality of the problem by one. Still, this advantage is overshadowed by the computational power required to model stage scale simulations of hydraulic fractures primarily due to the nonlinearity arising from fluid flow inside the fracture. Typical assumptions to improve the computational efficiency lead to the inability of simulators to describe proppant transport which is critical to treatment design. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to increase the speed of convergence of coupled geomechanics (DDM) and fluid flow problem. The algorithm employs an analytical, local linear approximation of the Reynolds lubrication equation to solve the coupled non-linear system of equations. An initial solution is estimated through the linear system, and it is then used in the iterative solution approach for the non-linear system as an initial guess. This improvement has allowed us to use the algorithm to develop a fully three-dimensional hydraulic fracturing simulator which can run in an acceptable runtime using commonly available computational power. 1. INTRODUCTION Hydraulic fracturing has made economical recovery from low permeability shale reservoirs possible. With the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, multistage fracturing of horizontal wells has become ubiquitous. The complexity of the involved physical process, geological spatial variability and complexity, and limited access to the treated formation make it difficult to achieve reliable completion designs (Damjanac and Cundall, 2015). To address this problem, the selection of crucial design parameters is commonly done by duplicating a completion design from successful analog fields and optimizing it by trial and error. As every shale is unique, this strategy is costly and has an associated learning curve for design engineers (Leem and Reyna, 2014). Also, the behavior of proppant transport inside multiple growing fractures adds additional complexity to the process, and hence it becomes too intricate to model without numerical and computational techniques. This generates the need for a comprehensive hydraulic fracturing simulator which can account for all the key factors and assist in the completion process, thus reducing the cost and time required for achieving optimum designs.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: We have developed a new frac-pack model to simulate power-law fluid flow coupled with proppant transport inside the fracture. Two empirical correlations of the relative velocity between the fluid and proppant for the vertical direction (settling) and the horizontal direction (retardation) are incorporated in the model. This model can simulate fully 3-D fracture growth in poro-elasto-plastic materials with tensile and shear failure. A cohesive zone model is used for fracture propagation along with a dynamic and adaptive meshing procedure. We investigate the effect of fluid viscosity, injection rate, proppant diameter, and reservoir permeability on proppant placement. Higher apparent viscosity fluid and injection rate results in wider fractures with better proppant placement, when the fracture is expected to be contained within the payzone. In the case of fracpacks, utilizing larger diameter of proppant leads to settling-dominant proppant placement rather than the retardation-dominant due to the relatively wider induced fracture. The effect of fluid leak-off and the pore pressure diffusion in the reservoir is captured. Higher leak-off in the high permeability sands leads to a poroelastic backstress that builds up around the fracture, and results in a shorter fracture due to larger leak-off. This new frac-pack model allows us to design and analyze hydraulic fracturing stimulations in soft, elasto-plastic formations when rheologically complex fracturing fluids are used. Our results also provide guidelines for the selection of fracturing fluid rheology, proppant size, and injection rates. 1. INTRODUCTION Hydraulic fracturing is a widely applied well stimulation technique that has been utilized for more than 60 years in the oil and gas industry (King, 2012). This stimulation technique has been mainly used for hard and tight rocks which exhibit low permeability and linear-elastic behavior. Unconsolidated or poorly consolidated reservoirs also require hydraulic fracturing operations, so-called frac-pack completions. Frac-packing combines fracturing and sand control into one technique (Marquez et al., 2013). The fracture induced by a high-viscosity fluid helps to improve production rates, and to place proppant within fractures and in the annulus between the screen and casing in order to prevent formation sand production.

                    "abstract": "A novel and fully coupled hydraulic-fracturing model derived from a nonlocal continuum theory of peridynamics is presented and applied to the hydraulic-fracture (HF) propagation problem. It is shown that this modeling approach provides an alternative to finite-element and finite-volume methods for solving poroelastic and fracture-propagation problems. In this paper, we specifically investigate the interaction between an HF and natural fractures (NFs). The peridynamics model presented here allows us to simulate the propagation of multiple, nonplanar, interacting fractures and provides a novel approach to simulate the interaction between HFs and NFs. The model predictions in two dimensions have been validated by reproducing published experimental results where the interaction between an HF and an NF is controlled by the principal-stress contrast and the approach angle. A detailed parametric study involving poroelasticity and mechanical properties of the rock is performed to understand why an HF becomes arrested or crosses an NF. This analysis reveals that poroelasticity, resulting from high fracture-fluid leakoff, has a dominant influence on the interaction between an HF and an NF. In addition, the fracture toughness of the rock, the toughness of the NF, and the shear strength of the NF also affect the interaction between an HF and an NF. We also investigate the interaction of multiple completing fractures with NFs in two dimensions and demonstrate the applicability of the approach to simulate complex fracture networks on a field scale. Finally, the 3D interaction study elucidated that the height of the NF, the position of the NF, and the opening resistance of the NF all have a significant effect on the 3D interaction between an HF and an NF.

                    "abstract": "Natural fractures, hydraulic fractures, and acid etched fractures have some degree of surface roughness. These surface asperities are largely responsible for the hydraulic conductivity of these fractures. This paper presents a model to quantify the fracture closure process that is crucial to predicting the stress dependent conductivity of fractures and estimating the minimum in-situ stress using fracture injection tests. Past studies that have investigated the fracture closure process have assumed the fracture surfaces to be two parallel plates closing in uniformly on rough surfaces and asperities. In reality, hydraulically induced fractures are wider in the middle and narrower near the fracture tip. As a result, asperities on the rough fracture surfaces come into contact near the fracture tip well before they do near the middle of the fracture. This evolution of the entire fracture geometry and its impact on stress redistribution and contact behavior has not yet been investigated. In this paper, we present a method and general algorithms to model the dynamic closure behavior of a hydraulic fracture while accounting for the initial fracture shape, rough fracture surfaces and deformation of asperities in contact. Analytic solutions from linear elastic fracture mechanics for three fracture models (PKN, KGD and radial fracture geometry) are coupled with a general contact law to show that the fracture closure process is a gradual, non-local process, which occurs at the fracture edges initially and then moves progressively to the center of fracture, as the fluid pressure inside the fracture declines. Our study also reveals that the minimum in-situ stress should not be picked at the occurrence of mechanical closure from fracture injection tests as conventional practice suggests. "

                    "abstract": "Clastic rocks with variable grain sizes exhibit different flow properties depending on how the various grain sizes are geometrically arranged within the grain pack. Grain arrangement must be assessed to quantify dynamic petrophysical properties when rocks exhibit non-unimodal grain-size distributions. A non-unimodal throat-size distribution will be observed, for instance, in cases where different grain sizes are arranged in laminated form (e.g., aeolian sandstones). Clastic rocks that have been subject to extreme diagenesis and recrystallization, such as tight-gas sandstones, often exhibit bimodal grain and pore-throat size distributions. This paper investigates the impact of grain arrangement on permeability and capillary pressure in clastic rocks that exhibit multiple grain sizes. Two extreme cases are studied for grain packs that include variable grain sizes: when grains are (i) randomly dispersed, and (ii) laminated in the grain pack. Equations are derived to calculate permeability in each case. Additionally, shale concentration is accounted for in the calculation of permeability for both laminated and poly-dispersed grain arrangements. A three-dimensional chart is constructed to illustrate the behavior of permeability with respect to rock type fraction and shale concentration. The assessment includes the calculation of permeability anisotropy resulting from grain-size laminations. Synthetic samples of grain packs are also constructed and subject to pore-scale fluid flow simulations to calculate permeability and throat-size distribution and to examine how these properties change with different grain-size arrangements. Finally, a new rock classification method that considers grain arrangement, capillary pressure, shale concentration, and permeability is introduced and verified with measurements acquired in a Carboniferous tight-gas sandstone from northern Germany. Our method of rock classification yields improved permeability calculations compared to widely used classification methods such as Winland R35, which implicitly assume a unimodal throat-size distribution. The new rock classification method can be readily adapted to calculate more specialized fluid-transport properties such as relative permeability. It can also be modified to account for capillary pressure during both imbibition and drainage and their consequence of saturation-height behavior. "

                    "abstract": "Nuclear borehole instruments are ubiquitous in well logging—from bare-bones logging-while-drilling (LWD) gamma to conventional triple-combo and more exotic neutron-gamma capture (Σ) and spectroscopy tools. Now, more than ever, nuclear modeling is being used in-stead of physical experiments to design new tools, to re-late nuclear measurements to formation properties and petrophysical parameters, and even to generate “digital” calibration standards. This paper discusses significant improvements in software and hardware used to model measurements acquired with borehole nuclear instruments. These advances make nuclear modeling more accurate, more efficient, and substantially less expensive to perform. For qualitative interrogations of complex rock formations, The University of Texas at Austin developed UTNuPro to compute macroscopic nuclear parameters. It is a successor to the venerable SNUPAR program that supports more elements and yields better matches with Monte Carlo calculations. An inversion-based interpretation involves adjusting formation properties until a predicted nuclear log matches what was measured. Parameters computed with UTNuPro can be utilized by some inversion routines to provide first-order trends without requiring proprietary knowledge of the tool geometry. If the user possesses details of the tool geometry, then nuclear Monte Carlo simulations can provide quantitative results. Wondering whether a nuclear log makes sense in shale when drilling with an unusual mud? Model the shale (or bed boundaries or layers, etc.) before and after invasion. Designing a new tool? It is straightforward to model different nuclear sources and detector types. This paper explores recent and forthcoming changes in the nuclear Monte Carlo n-particle code (MCNP) that are useful to the industry. Modeling the tool geometry is much easier because MCNP now supports an “unstructured mesh” geometry that can be rendered (almost) directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file for the tool. An “importance map” of the geometry is constructed simultaneously to speed up simulations. Such maps can also be used for fast, quasilinear modeling to implement reliable inversion-based interpretations in real-time, akin to borehole resistivity, resulting in better rock compositional assessments. New helper tools improve detector processing and particle tracking (MCNPTools), compute more realistic post-processed detector spectra (DRiFT), and produce source descriptions for complicated decay chains, such as those for U and Th necessary for natural gamma modeling (ISC). New physics includes alpha particle tracking (vital for modeling 10B-based neutron detectors) and correlated fission event generators (CGMF and FREYA). Pulse-neutron spectral interpretation is simplified because MCNP can now “tag” each photon with its element of origin. A comprehensive modeling program requires some type of computer cluster; accordingly, this paper provides best practices for choosing appropriate hardware as well as constructing and maintaining the cluster with mini-mum effort while nonetheless satisfying the strict US Department of Energy requirements for MCNP clusters.

                    "abstract": "In complex geological environments, interpretation methods based on fast modeling and inversion procedures deliver better estimates of petrophysical properties than conventional methods. Neutron measurements are affected by high-order formation and borehole effects. Their depth of investigation is also very sensitive to porosity, borehole size variations, and fluid and rock properties. Consequently, reliable petrophysical interpretation of neutron logs under complex rock and geometrical conditions requires fast modeling methods. We develop a fast-forward algorithm for a commercial LWD neutron tool. The algorithm is based on perturbation theory, flux sensitivity functions (FSFs), and diffusion flux-difference (DFD) approximations. The DFD method interpolates between Monte Carlo (MC)-derived, base-case FSFs using one-group diffusion models and a Rytov approximation. Diffusion approximations successfully capture sensitivity flux perturbations: neutron porosities simulated using DFD-perturbed and MC-derived FSFs agree within one porosity unit (p.u.) in highly deviated wells, enlarged boreholes, and wells with invasion. They significantly outperform linear interpolation approaches, reducing errors in estimated porosity by as much as 10 p.u. Even when diffusion approximations are applied, perturbation theory may still yield inaccurate results when compared to neutron porosity estimated from MCNP counts for regions exhibiting contrasting properties, and primarily enlarged boreholes. We introduce a new two-step algorithm to improve neutron modeling accuracy to MCNP counts in the presence of standoff. The algorithm is based on two sets of base cases: one for detector counts, and the other for sensitivity functions. On one hand, diffusion flux-difference approximations are used to compute perturbed sensitivity functions for any tool, borehole, and formation configuration. On the other hand, count base cases obtained for 21.6-cm (8.5-in), 24.1-cm (9.5-in), and 26.7-cm (10.5-in) boreholes extend the validity of the Taylor series expansion by minimizing the size of the borehole perturbations. Compared to neutron porosity calculated from MCNP counts, the new algorithm yields relatively low errors in enlarged boreholes. Comparison benchmarks against synthetic and field cases in vertical and deviated wells confirm good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations and field logging data, respectively. For the synthetic cases, vertical and horizontal wells were assumed with the tool penetrating several bed layers with contrasting hydrogen index. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to simulate neutron detector counts and to compare against results obtained from our fast-forward algorithm. The fast-forward algorithm was then applied to a field case featuring a high-angle well penetrating a Norwegian sandstone with light hydrocarbons; good agreement was obtained with field logs. "

                    "abstract": "Density measurements are widely used for the in-situ assessment of formation porosity. Traditionally, bulk density is measured with a Gamma-Gamma density tool using a radioactive chemical source. Neutron-Gamma density was recently developed to infer porosity with non-chemical sources. It is therefore imperative to quantify the differences in spatial resolution and accuracy between the two measurements and the corresponding impact on petrophysical interpretation practices. We designed a theoretical, albeit practical logging-while-drilling (LWD) Neutron-Gamma density tool and optimized source-detector spacing for maximum accuracy. The tool design comprises a 14 MeV neutron source, two gamma ray detectors and two fast neutron detectors. Counts ratios are used to establish a linear relationship with formation bulk density. This design yields an accuracy of 0.0147 g/cm3 in shale-free formations, and 0.0182 g/cm3 in shales, to be compared to the accuracy of traditional Gamma-Gamma density measurements (0.015 g/cm3). Neutron-Gamma density uses inputs from all four detectors in an effort to set apartCompton scattering effects needed to calculatebulk density. Consequently, the spine-and-rib correction technique is not implemented in real time, leaving the measurement vulnerable to borehole environmental effects and mainly standoff. Standoff should be limited to 0.25 in for light mud, leading to a 0.05 g/cm3 correction ofbulk density. While the vertical resolution of Gamma-Gamma density is approximately 1 ft, results obtained from synthetic cases show that the vertical resolution of Neutron-Gamma density is limited to 2.5 ft. The vertical resolution of Neutron-Gamma density competes against improved depth of investigation. Neutron-Gamma density is less affected by invasion than Gamma-Gamma density. Depth of investigation of Neutron-Gamma density is approximately 9.5 in, i.e. twice as long as the depth of investigation of Gamma-Gamma density (~4 in). The main technical challenge of Neutron-Gamma density is measurement reliability across diverse solid and fluid rock compositions. Synthetic examples show that the tool design accurately resolves formation density in shale and shaly formations, high-density formations such as anhydrite, and formations saturated with low-density gas. In these cases, the accuracy is similar to that of Gamma-Gamma density and the measurement remains reliable for porosity estimates within +/- 1 pu. We introduce a new tool design for a radioisotope-free, in-situ measurement of bulk density based on two-particle transport. This optimized tool design is the first one to provide an accuracy that compares to Gamma-Gamma density in clean and shaly formations. Synthetic cases serve to compare the measurements and provide insight about the conditions when Neutron-Gamma density can be used as an alternative to Gamma-Gamma density while achieving equivalent accuracy and performance.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Layering-induced anisotropy of shale formations increases uncertainty in determining in-situ mechanical properties and stresses, thus increasing the risk associated with implementing advanced drilling and hydraulic stimulation in shales. We conduct simultaneous triaxial stress tests and ultrasonic wave propagation monitoring to quantify static and dynamic stiffness anisotropy in Mancos Shale. Two case studies evidence the impacts of (1) confining stress and (2) presence of pre-existing fractures, on dynamic-static transforms of Young’s moduli and Poisson’s ratios with increasing deviatoric stress. The first case shows that confining stress more heavily impacts dynamic mechanical properties than static. The effect is most prominent at high deviatoric stresses, where stress-induced damage increases the difference between dynamic and static Young’s moduli. The second case shows that samples with pre-existing fractures exhibit even higher differences between dynamic and static Young’s moduli than non-fractured (intact) and damaged rocks. Fractured samples exhibit ratios of Edyn/Est between 5:1 and 7:1, whereas intact samples generally remain near the 3:1 ratio. Pre- and post-test X-ray microtomography imaging confirm that bedding planes and pre-existing fractures act as planes of weakness, while sample layering causes mechanical stratigraphy, where changes in lithology may cause fractures to reorient. Results highlight the limitations of tangent linear elasticity moduli to explain complex deformational behavior in shales and the need for better models that address the strain-magnitude dependence of rock properties. 1. INTRODUCTION Shale layering causes bed-parallel differences in rock properties, a component of mechanical stratigraphy (Laubach et al. 2009). Stratigraphic variations in mechanical properties are known to influence the growth of engineered fractures (Bosziak et al. 2014). A further element of bed-perpendicular anisotropy can be introduced by pre-existing fractures, which can impact rock stress-strain response (Bergbauer and Pollard 2004). Over geologic time, subsurface stresses may vary, which can cause natural fracturing. Chemical alteration (diagenesis) might stiffen natural fractures, therefore their orientations might not be aligned with current stresses or layering (Laubach et al. 2004). Consequently, the attributes and orientation of layering and diagenetically altered open fractures can impact rock mechanical behavior, engineered fracture growth, and rock failure under a range of loading paths. Layering and pre-existing fractures are suspected to influence the behavior of shales undergoing hydraulic fracture treatment (Suarez-Rivera et al. 2013, Gale et al. 2014). "

                    "abstract": "Vertical transverse isotropy (VTI) is commonly observed in shales due to azimuthal variations of stress around the borehole or intrinsic variations in rock composition within a layer. In VTI formations, the stiffness coefficient matrix consists of five independent coefficients: 𝑐11, 𝑐33, 𝑐44, 𝑐13, and 𝑐66. Estimation of these five coefficients is fundamental to successfully locating and designing hydraulic fractures. However, compressional and shear slowness logs acquired in vertical wells yield information on 𝑐33 and 𝑐44 only. Calculating 𝑐44 from the quadrupole mode using logging-while-drilling (LWD) instruments remains challenging because low-frequency quadrupole slowness is smaller than formation shear slowness. Furthermore, presence of thin layers increases the complexity of estimating true layer elastic properties because of averaging effects on sonic logs. This paper introduces a new workflow to calculate the five stiffness coefficients in layered VTI formations by inverting LWD sonic logs as follows: First, we calculate axial-sensitivity functions of Stoneley, compressional, and quadrupole slownesses to five properties, namely, vertical compressional slowness (𝑠𝑝𝑣), horizontal compressional slowness (𝑠𝑝ℎ), vertical shear slowness (𝑠𝑠𝑣), horizontal shear slowness (𝑠𝑠ℎ), and 1/√𝑐13. Next, we use the calculated sensitivities to forward model Stoneley, compressional, and quadrupole slownesses, and finally we estimate stiffness coefficients using multi-step inversion because borehole modes are predominantly sensitive to one of the coefficients at a given frequency. We show that sensitivities vary when the formation is fast, intermediate, or slow; therefore, we apply the interpretation workflow to fast and slow formations with 17% anisotropy. The corrected 𝑐44 is calculated with a relative error below 6%, 𝑐13 and 𝑐11 are estimated by inverting the quadrupole logs from 4 kHz to 7 kHz, and 𝑐33 and 𝑐66 are calculated by inverting the compressional and Stoneley logs, respectively. Using the new interpretation workflow, we successfully calculate the five stiffness coefficients corrected for averaging effects of VTI layers, which can be used for reliable and accurate design of hydraulic fracturing operations in organic mudrocks.

                    "abstract": "Sonic logs acquired in high-angle and horizontal (HA/HZ) wells can be severely affected by averaging effects, processing noise, and mode interference near layer boundaries. Consequently, significant differences may exist between measured and true layer slownesses. In HA/HZ wells, the interpretation of sonic logs is best achieved through forward modeling and inversion. However, forward modeling using numerical simulation requires high computational time and memory resources, making real-time interpretation impractical. This paper introduces a new interpretation method of sonic logs acquired in HA/HZ wells based on fast forward modeling the flexural wave mode. To that end, we invoke three-dimensional (3D), frequency-domain spatial sensitivity functions. The influences of the sonic tool, borehole fluid, and depth on investigation are accounted for in the calculation of sensitivity functions. Sensitivity functions reliably quantify the effects of thin/nearby beds otherwise unheeded by conventional interpretations, thereby allowing improved distinction between intrinsic and geometric anisotropy. We use 3D sensitivity functions to calculate flexural slownesses in synthetic formations by varying dip, layer thickness, and layer elastic properties. Results yield slownesses calculated for a wireline tool with perpendicular dipoles in the frequency range from 2 kHz to 7 kHz. Flexural slownesses calculated with sensitivity functions are compared to flexural slownesses calculated using a 3D time-domain finite-difference (3DFD) method, yielding relative differences below 5%. It is found that when formations are logged at high dip angle, the difference between measured and true shear slowness is 20 μs/ft. We decrease this difference by comparing slownesses calculated with orthogonal dipole sources (dipole X and dipole Y) and calculating slownesses using opposite azimuthal receivers which improve slowness estimations by a factor of 2. Differences in slownesses measured at low frequencies with orthogonal dipoles arise in isotropic formations, thereby indicating presence of geometric anisotropy, while the intersection of slownesses identifies the location of bed boundaries. Fast forward modeling using spatial sensitivity functions decreases simulation time of sonic logs by at least a factor of 1000 compared to finite-difference numerical simulations, and is a viable method for inversion-based interpretation of sonic logs.

                    "abstract": "Formation pressure measurements acquired with wireline formation testers can provide vital information about a reservoir, such as pressure gradients, fluid properties and contacts, and degree of hydraulic compartmentalization. Despite their wide acceptance in the petroleum industry, these measurements still suffer from significant uncertainty due to the dynamic environment in the near-wellbore region resulting from mud-filtrate invasion. Additional uncertainty arises when these measurements are acquired across capillary transition zones where the effects of mud-filtrate invasion vary with depth. Identification and correction of these effects is essential for accurately evaluating new prospects, quantifying reserves, and predicting future production performance. Radial numerical simulations of mud-filtrate invasion and wireline formation-tester pressure measurements were performed to evaluate the uncertainty introduced into these measurements in response to various geological and petrophysical properties. Baseline numerical simulations were validated against published data and available analytical models. The uncertainty of these measurements was then quantified by systematically perturbing one or more reservoir properties and observing the resulting pressure response. Specific focus was placed on understanding how this uncertainty influenced the interpretation of pressure gradients, fluid properties, and fluid contacts. Results from numerical simulations verified that wireline formation-tester pressure measurements are affected by a combination of in-situ capillary pressure and mud-filtrate invasion effects. For high-quality reservoirs able to sufficiently dissipate localized pressure disturbances caused by mud-filtrate invasion, results indicate that the difference between measured and actual formation pressure is equal to the capillary pressure. When mud filtrate and native reservoir fluids are miscible, absence of capillary pressure gives rise to accurate pressure measurements. This finding agrees with previously published literature based on conceptual models. Conversely, for lower-quality reservoirs, the effects of supercharging and variations in saturation-dependent reservoir properties in the near-wellbore region lead to elevated levels of uncertainty. These effects are most prominent in tight, highly heterogeneous formations where mud-filtrate invasion is non-uniform and supercharging effects persist long after the onset of invasion. Based on the latter findings, interpretation guidelines are established for the estimation of pressure gradients concerning the level of uncertainty associated with wireline formation-tester pressure measurements acquired in the presence of mud-filtrate invasion.

                    "abstract": "The conventional interpretation of production logs (PL) acquired in time-lapse mode helps petrophysicists to detect the advancement of fluid contacts in the near-borehole region. Without inclusion of a dynamic reservoir model, conventional time-lapse interpretation remains limited to describing time variations of fluid inflow rates produced from or injected into fluid-producing rock formations. However, proper reservoir management requires quantifying depth variations of near-borehole properties (e.g., formation damage and fluid saturation) over time to construct reliable field-scale reservoir models. This paper develops a new borehole-formation fluid flow model capable of simulating oil-water production measurements acquired from vertical and deviated boreholes. We implement an iteratively coupling flow algorithm to explicitly interface a borehole fluid flow model to a reservoir multiphase flow simulator. The specific application considered in this study invokes the coupled borehole-formation fluid flow model to estimate near-borehole permeability and water saturation from time-lapse oil-water production measurements. Borehole fluid flow simulation is based on an isothermal two-fluid formulation that applies separate mass and momentum conservation equations to the oil and water phases. When solving momentum conservation equations, we compute interfacial drag and buoyant forces based on the assumption of spherical oil or water droplets with negligible interfacial mass transfer. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of droplet diameter associated with the discontinuous fluid phase is dynamically modified to accurately account for variations of slip velocity across fluid-producing layers. Linkage of the borehole and formation fluid flow models is next carried out by introducing additional source terms into the borehole mass conservation equations. In a synthetic reservoir model supported by an infinite-acting aquifer, the coupled flow algorithm integrates production logs acquired in time-lapse mode to construct a near-borehole reservoir model that describes depth variations of skin factor over the elapsed time. Feasibility studies show that the estimated petrophysical properties can be adversely influenced by the large volume of investigation associated with PL measurements. Moreover, undetectable fluid production across low-permeability layers decreases the sensitivity of production logs to layer incremental flow rate, thus increasing estimation uncertainty. Despite these limitations, estimated fluid saturation and permeability across high-permeability layers are within 15% and 20% of the corresponding actual values, respectively. The developed interpretation algorithm additionally integrates well logs and production logs acquired in an oil-water field example to construct a PL-calibrated near-borehole reservoir model. Results enable (a) the differentiation of low-permeability layers from highly-damaged formations, (b) the identification of layers accountable for high water production, and (c) the quantification of the added value of remedial workover operations to isolate water-producing layers. In addition, the coupled model is used to study sensitivity of production logs to near-borehole petrophysical properties. We show that production logs are mainly sensitive to formations’ absolute and relative permeabilities, water saturation, and pressure. "

                    "abstract": "Interpretation of two-phase production logs (PLs) traditionally constructs borehole fluid-flow models decoupled from the physics of reservoir rocks. However, quantifying formation dynamic petrophysical properties from PLs requires simultaneous modeling of both borehole and formation fluid-flow phenomena. This paper develops a novel transient borehole/formation fluid-flow model that allows quantification of the effect of formation petrophysical properties on measurements acquired with production-logging tools (PLTs). We invoke a 1D, isothermal, two-fluid formulation to simulate borehole fluid-phase velocity, pressure, volume fraction, and density in oil/water-flow systems. The developed borehole fluid-flow model implements oil-dominant and water-dominant bubbly flow regimes with the inversion point taking place approximately when the oil volume fraction is equal to 0.5. Droplet diameter is dynamically modified to simulate interfacial drag effects, and to effectively account for variations of slip velocity in the borehole. Subsequently, a new successive iterative method interfaces the borehole and formation fluid-flow models by introducing appropriate source terms into the borehole fluid-phase mass-conservation equations. The novel iterative coupling method integrated with the developed borehole fluid-flow model allows dynamic modification of reservoir boundary conditions to accurately simulate transient behavior of borehole crossflow taking place across differentially depleted rock formations. In the case of rapid variations of near-borehole properties, frequent borehole/formation communication inevitably increases the computational time required for fluid-flow simulation. Despite this limitation, in a two-layer reservoir model penetrated by a vertical borehole, the coupling method accurately quantifies a 14% increase of volume-averaged oil-phase relative permeability of the low-pressure layer caused by through-the-borehole cross-communication of differentially depleted layers. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the alteration of near-borehole petrophysical properties primarily depends on formation average pressure, fluid-phase density contrast, and borehole-deviation angle. A practical application of the new coupled fluid-flow model is numerical simulation of borehole production measurements to estimate formation average pressure from two-phase selective-inflow-performance (SIP) analysis. This study suggests that incorporating static (shut-in) PL passes into the SIP analysis could result in misleading estimation of formation average pressure. "

                    "abstract": "Resistivity logs acquired in hydrocarbon-bearing formations invaded by oil-base mud (OBM) often indicate abnormally high values of mobile water saturation. It is not possible to explain such abnormally high values of water saturation with saturation-height analysis. The common explanation invokes rock wettability alterations due to surfactants included in oil-base mud-filtrate (OBMF). A quantitative study is needed to explain whether the interaction of OBMF surfactants with water-wetted grains can cause a sufficiently large increase in mobile water saturation in the near-wellbore region to affect resistivity logs. In this paper, we use a near wellbore simulator to model the processes of mud-filtrate invasion and ensuing wettability alteration once emulsifiers included in OBMF make contact with grain surfaces. We assume a wettability alteration model in which the degree and type of alteration are governed by the pore-volume concentration of emulsifier in OBMF within the invaded formation. Results indicate surfactants included in OBMF may change the rock's surface wettability from a water-wet to a neutral or oil-wet condition. This behavior causes a fraction of the originally residual pore volume of connate water to become moveable. The radial displacement of movable water by OBMF can give rise to an annulus of water bank, which in turn causes the resistivity annulus. We perform simulations of OBMF invasion into oil and gas saturated formations. Simulated apparent resistivity logs across layers which exhibited shallow invasion showed a reverse OBM effect where deep resistivity was larger than shallow resistivity. "

                    "abstract": "Tight-gas reservoirs undergo unique and often complex burial, diagenetic, structural, fluid pressure and saturation histories. Porosity alteration from compaction, cementation and grain leaching can continue after hydrocarbon charge, further complicating saturation modeling. Many reservoirs have gone through multiple cycles of drainage and imbibition, often at different stages on the diagenetic pathway to current pore-scale morphologies. The understanding of saturation distribution and state is not only desired but required for predicting reservoir performance, estimating realistic recoverable volumes, and optimizing costs for development and production. The Almond Formation is characterized by three depositional facies associations: shoreface, deltaic and fluvial-coastal plain. These groups are commonly fine grained and well sorted. The differences in pore architecture arise from differences in primary depositional fabric and rock-frame mineralogy and their subsequent diagenetic alteration; yielding predictive trends in porosity-permeability space. Drainage and imbibition saturation-height models have been developed from core studies and integrated with logs to verify that reservoirs are at primary drainage and to highlight any potential imbibition due to trap tilting or leaking. Centrifuge and multicycle mercury injection data were integrated to produce composite drainage capillary pressure curves. Stressed mercury extrusion tests are commonly used for modeling water saturation through the imbibition process. These tests display no correlation with rock quality at low capillary pressures. To circumvent these problems, mercury extrusion was integrated with maximum-trapped-gas measurements obtained by countercurrent imbibition experiments. Using the resistivity-derived water saturation model as reference, the free-water level for drainage and imbibition models was optimized by matching saturation-height models in reservoirs free of resistivity shoulder-bed effects. The accuracy of the match in different rock qualities provided insights on the likely saturation state of reservoirs. Such observations were used to develop successful interpretations of the special distribution of free-water level, reservoir architecture, and hydrocarbon charge. "

                    "abstract": "Spherical- and cylindrical-based analytical models are frequently used to estimate reservoir flow properties from Formation-Testing (FT) measurements. Solutions to these equations are developed under restrictive assumptions which compromise their reliability over a wide range of field conditions. On the other hand, a Wellbore Numerical Simulator (WNS) enables improved understanding of complex flow systems (Escobar Gómez et al., 2016). In general, numerical models implement full multiphase flow algorithms which are robust but computationally expensive. Such condition often makes the numerical simulation problem less appealing and the estimation of properties more non-unique, especially for Pressure Transient Analysis (PTA). Understanding the circumstances under which total flow properties dominate over individual-phase flow properties prompts the implementation of a singlephase type model for faster and simpler FT-PTA. Starting from a black-oil model, this paper develops a simplified multi-dimensional single-phase pressure equation applicable for multiphase FT data analysis, which is shown to be valid over a wide range of petrophysical conditions. To conduct the work, a multi-dimensional, single-well, finite-difference model is developed for forward modeling of FT operations. The formulation of the algorithm allows simulating either single- or two-phase flow. Additionally, the numerical code couples an analytical mudcake growth model to simulate the process of mud-filtrate invasion. We perform radial numerical simulations to quantify the impact of multiphase flow on otherwise singlephase equivalent pressure transients. The study includes effects of pressure-dependent oil properties and two-phase relative permeability. Findings from synthetic cases indicate that such multiphase effects on pressure transients are negligible except in the presence of extreme pressure drops and substantial spatial variations in mobility; for a wide range of testing and reservoir conditions, the pressure signal is mostly governed by combined rock-fluid properties. For PTA purposes, the latter behavior justifies the implementation of a single-phase type model for fast and accurate flow-regime identification and estimation of total mobility. The above results are confirmed with a field study where measurements were acquired in a multiphase environment. Common practices in numerical interpretation of FT measurements would suggest the need for multiphase algorithms. Nonetheless, excellent pressure history matching is attained with the developed WNS in single-phase mode. Such results confirm that, under suitable testing (and reservoir) conditions, FT pressure transients chiefly respond to spatial variations and total flow properties. Our work confirms the feasibility of identifying testing conditions such that the recorded pressure is negligibly affected by individual-phase flow properties. The single-phase equivalent model developed in this paper, applicable under such conditions, provides fast and accurate quantification of flow zones without a-priori multiphase flow information. "

                    "abstract": "Shales and other unconventional or low permeability (tight) reservoirs house vast quantities of hydrocarbons, often demonstrate considerable water uptake, and are potential repositories for fluid sequestration. The pore-scale topology and fluid transport mechanisms within these nanoporous sedimentary rocks remain to be fully understood. Image-informed pore-scale models are useful tools for studying porous media: a debated question in shale pore-scale petrophysics is whether there is a representative elementary volume (REV) for shale models? Furthermore, if an REV exists, how does it differ among petrophysical properties? We obtain three dimensional (3D) models of the topology of microscale shale volumes from image analysis of focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) image stacks and investigate the utility of these models as a potential REV for shale. The scope of data used in this work includes multiple local groups of neighboring FIB-SEM images of different microscale sizes, corresponding core-scale (milli- and centimeters) laboratory data, and, for comparison, series of two-dimensional (2D) cross sections from broad ion beam SEM images (BIB-SEM), which capture a larger microscale field of view than the FIB-SEM images; this array of data is larger than the majority of investigations with FIB-SEM-derived microscale models of shale. Properties such as porosity, organic matter content, and pore connectivity are extracted from each model. Assessments of permeability with single phase, pressure-driven flow simulations are performed in the connected pore space of the models using the lattice-Boltzmann method. Calculated petrophysical properties are compared to those of neighboring FIB-SEM images and to core-scale measurements of the sample associated with the FIB-SEM sites. Results indicate that FIB-SEM images below ∼5000 µm3 volume (the largest volume analyzed) are not a suitable REV for shale permeability and pore-scale networks; i.e. field of view is compromised at the expense of detailed, but often unconnected, nanopore morphology. Further, we find that it is necessary to acquire several local FIB-SEM or BIB-SEM images and correlate their extracted geometric properties to improve the likelihood of achieving representative values of porosity and organic matter volume. Our work indicates that FIB-SEM images of microscale volumes of shale are a qualitative tool for petrophysical and transport analysis. Finally, we offer alternatives for quantitative pore-scale assessments of shale. "

                    "abstract": "Multidimensional NMR inversion using Kronecker products poses several challenges. First, kernel compression is only possible when the kernel matrices are separable, and in recent years, there has been an increasing interest in NMR sequences with non-separable kernels. Second, in three or more dimensions, the singular value decomposition is not unique; therefore kernel compression is not well-defined for higher dimensions. Without kernel compression, the Kronecker product yields matrices that require large amounts of memory, making the inversion intractable for personal computers. Finally, incorporating arbitrary regularization terms is not possible using the Lawson–Hanson (LH) or the Butler–Reeds–Dawson (BRD) algorithms. We develop a minimization-based inversion method that circumvents the above problems by using multilinear forms to perform multidimensional NMR inversion without using kernel compression or Kronecker products. The new method is memory efficient, requiring less than 0.1% of the memory required by the LH or BRD methods. It can also be extended to arbitrary dimensions and adapted to include non-separable kernels, linear constraints, and arbitrary regularization terms. Additionally, it is easy to implement because only a cost function and its first derivative are required to perform the inversion. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: Simultaneous ultrasonic wave propagation and triaxial-stress testing are used to investigate the effects of fractures on the dynamic and static mechanical properties of clastic rocks under varying stress loading paths. The first case study explores the influence of pre-existing artificial fractures, while the second investigates the effects of deviatoric stress-induced microfracture development. Experimental results indicate that presence of fractures distinctly decreases wave velocities, with calculated dynamic elastic moduli decreasing by up to 7.5% in artificially fractured sandstone. Fracturing also tends to amplify the stress dependence of wave attenuation and the filtering of high-frequency wave components. Results also show a divergence of shear wave velocities polarized at 90° due to the development of microfracturing well before shear failure under deviatoric loading. This behavior occurs simultaneously with decreases in shear wave velocity and increasing stiffness nonlinearity, and is consistently aligned with the onset of rock dilatancy. Our study highlights the potential for full waveform analysis in sonic wellbore logging for in-situ fracture diagnostics, and the utilization of shear wave anisotropy to characterize rock damage. Introduction Oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs provides new avenues for energy production in the US, accounting for 78.2 Bbls of crude oil, and 949.3 Tcf of natural gas. This equates to roughly 30% and 41% of the technically recoverable oil and gas in the US respectively [1]. Although unconventional formations have become increasingly important for the oil and gas industry, the need for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing force narrow profit margins, and low oil prices further decrease their financial feasibility. Core samples from unconventional plays exhibit minimal matrix permeability, however mudrocks are often laden with natural fractures on many scales [2]. Natural fractures not only act as planes of weakness for rock failure, facilitating the branching of hydraulic fractures, but they are also preferential conduits for the flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore [3]. Because evidence links natural fractures in tight reservoirs to increased production during hydraulic fracturing, gaining insight into the density and spatial distribution of natural fractures prior to hydraulic fracturing is vital for optimizing hydraulic stimulation efforts and maximizing hydrocarbon recovery [4]. Several methods have been developed for detecting, imaging, and characterizing natural fracture patterns and their relative abundance. Specifically, analysis of rock outcrops, core samples, well imaging and testing (DFIT/LOT), and microseismic data are among the most common, and most useful techniques for estimating the spatial distribution and density of natural fractures in the subsurface [5, 6]. Although each technique provides valuable information, their inherent limitations leave large technological gaps in our ability to utilize natural fractures to guide enhanced stimulation. Tool resolution, sample scale, depth of investigation, and sample disturbance are some limitations to in-situ characterization of natural fractures on micro scales and beyond the wellbore [7, 8, 9].

                    "abstract": "Abstract: The implementation of a low-frequency electromagnetic induction tool for propped-fracture detection and diagnostics requires in-depth examination of the reliability and accuracy of the method across fractures with realistic geomechanical features. Likewise, the method relies on the effective placement of electrically conductive proppant within the generated fractures for measurable sensitivity. We invoke a fast Fourier-transform-based volume integral equation simulation method for forward modeling to simulate the electromagnetic response of realistic fracture geometries generated in hydro-fracturing operations and under practical rock conditions. Improved performance is achieved by removing model features which are of little significance to the results and yet cause a significant computational overhead. To properly account for the effective proppant conductivity, we introduce a new technique for the measurement of proppant conductivity using a resistivity core holder. The conductivity of petroleum coke—a potential candidate to be used in the field—is tested in the laboratory. Resulting measurements are used to forward simulate the tool's response to multiple fracture geometries and sizes. Distinct results are obtained for fractures with different spatial distributions of proppant, indicating the possibility of distinguishing between them using a future inverse solver. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing continues to play a crucial role in unlocking oil and gas production in unconventional reservoirs. To better design hydraulic fracturing treatments, it is important to predict how fluid-driven cracks will propagate under various conditions; several models, including fully coupled porous flows and geomechanical models [1-4], have been proposed for this purpose. Validation of these models’ ability to predict complex fracture networks, however, requires the capability to measure fracture dimensions with diagnostic methods. From another perspective, prior knowledge of the Stimulated Reservoir Volume (SRV) provided by fracture diagnostics can greatly improve the reliability of reservoir simulations. The need for and efforts on fracture diagnostic methods have been growing with the improvement of hydraulic fracturing techniques. One common technique is to use proppant tracers, which can be detected by radiation sensors, for near-wellbore proppant detection [5, 6]. One shortcoming of such methods, aside from the obvious radioactive material safety concerns, is that the radiation from proppant located far from the wellbore is harder to detect, thus reducing the sensitivity to the size of the propped fracture. Near-wellbore temperature and water hammer measurements can record the signature of fracture spacing, length and formation inhomogeneity. However, these measurements suffer from non-uniqueness, which makes the extraction of fracture properties very challenging [7, 8]. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional practices in the interpretation of formation-tester (FT) measurements invoke spherical- and/or cylindrical-based analytical models. Solutions to these equations are primarily limited to spherical or point sources, homogeneous reservoirs, and/or spherical/hemispherical flow regimes. Such assumptions compromise the reliability of the analytical models over a wide range of practical field conditions. To address this challenge, a wellbore numerical simulator (WNS), although more complex, is adapted in this study to enable precise probe shape modeling, and reliable identification and quantification of spatially variable flow systems. Understanding the effect that different probe shapes have on FT pressure transients permits identifying tool geometries that maximize early-time rock-fluid effects on the pressure signal. Moreover, quantifying the extent to which anisotropy, relative dip, tool position, heterogeneity and supercharging further influence the pressure transient necessities modification of probe-shape correction coefficients, where a WNS eliminates these corrections for improved FT pressure transient analysis (PTA). A detailed three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference single-phase flow WNS for FT operations was developed that includes circular and elongated probe geometries and dual packers. The algorithm honors a full permeability tensor formulation, and supports mud-filtrate invasion and mudcake growth. A numerical simulation study is performed to quantify the dependence of pressure transients on probe shapes. Findings emphasize the flow-apparent distortion of the spatial coordinates due to the elongated profile of oval probes. This phenomenon indicates that for the same velocity, and for a wide range of typical anisotropy ratios, elongated probes cause less pressure drop than circular ones. Furthermore, a thorough study of analytical and numerical simulation results is performed to assess the impact of factors influencing FT pressure transients, while appraising the need for probe shape correction coefficients. Results indicate that available point-source cylindrical-based analytical solutions properly predict middle to late time flow regimes, except for supercharged and heterogeneous dipping systems. Moreover, due to the lack of actual tool geometry, current point-source models provide flawed estimates of flow properties. This work also indicates that WNSs permit reliable job planning, better understanding of complex flow systems, improved FT-PTA, and estimation of not only spherical mobility but, more importantly, anisotropy.

                    "abstract": "Rocks that exhibit multi-modal throat-size distributions cannot be reliably appraised and classified using conventional methods such as Winland R35 (Pittman, 1992) or Amaefule's flow zone indicator (Amaefule et al., 1993). Such popular classification procedures/protocols are tacitly based on the concept that rocks exhibit a single dominant throat-size, and they do not consider neither the multi-modality nature of throats, nor the variation in the amplitude of throat or grain-size distributions. Carbonates and tight-gas sandstones are notorious for their non-unimodal variability of throat sizes. Wide variations of throat sizes are also often observed in rocks which have been subject to extreme diagenesis and recrystallization. This paper introduces new rock classification methods based on mercury-intrusion capillary pressure (MICP) and grain-size distribution measurements. We use three types of parametric basis functions to reproduce logarithmic throat-size and grain-size distributions derived from MICP data and grain-size distribution measurements. Magnetic resonance data are also invoked to quantify irreducible water saturation. First, a multi-modal Lorentzian distribution function is introduced where the function's free parameters are used to establish correlations between permeability and irreducible water saturation. In cases where grain-size data are available, we show how to estimate irreducible water saturation based on the surface-to-volume ratio of the rock. Results are then compared to a bimodal Gaussian distribution (Xu et al., 2013), and Thomeer hyperbolas (Thomeer, 1960), to assess when each method may or may not be more accurate to model the distribution of throat sizes and the corresponding flow properties. Finally, we introduce a new rock classification method that accounts for all pore and throat-geometry parameters to quantify storage and flow properties of rocks. In the case of Cotton-Valley group tight-gas sandstones, the new rock classification method reliably identifies outlier permeability measurements and groups rocks with common pore textural properties. We emphasize the importance of assimilating the multi-modality of throat sizes with a Panoma carbonate field example, where a more accurate rock classification is obtained when compared to the flow-zone indicator method. Finally, we examine the case of a clastic offshore field in Trinidad, where additional petrophysical data confirm that the bimodal nature of the grain-size distribution renders a reliable estimation of irreducible water saturation.

                    "abstract": "Estimation of total porosity from neutron and density porosity logs in organic shale (source rock) is challenging because these logs are substantially affected by fluid and matrix-composition effects. Conventional interpretation of neutron and density porosity logs often includes corrections for shale concentration in which the main objective is to improve the calculation of nonshale porosity in hydrocarbon-bearing zones. These corrections are not desirable in unconventional rock formations because shale pores can be hydrocarbon-saturated. Neutron and density porosity readings across shale zones are sometimes averaged by use of the root-mean-square (RMS) method. We introduce a new and simple analytical expression for total porosity that effectively separates both matrix and fluid effects on neutron and density porosity logs. The expression stems from a new nonlinear mixing law for neutron migration length that is coupled with the linear-density mixing law to calculate total porosity and fluid density. The method is applied in two sequential steps: First, separate corrections for only matrix effects are implemented to enhance the neutron-density crossover for qualitative interpretation of fluid type; second, the coupled equation is used to estimate fluid density and actual porosity devoid of matrix and fluid effects. Calculated porosity and fluid density can be used further to calculate water saturation from density logs. One remarkable feature of this method is the ease with which it can be applied to obtain accurate and reliable results. Application of the method only requires knowledge of single-component nuclear properties and mineral volumetric concentrations. One can obtain nuclear properties from a set of charts for multiple fluid types and minerals provided in this paper, whereas one can calculate mineral concentrations on the basis of available triple combo logs or gamma ray spectroscopy logs. Two synthetic and four field examples (two conventional and two shale-gas reservoirs) are used to test the method. First, we describe an application in a conventional siliciclastic sedimentary sequence in which only shale concentration calculated from gamma ray logs is required to improve the estimation of porosity in shaly sections. Second, we document several applications in which gamma ray spectroscopy logs are used together with a reliable hypothesis for clay type to define mineral properties. Results compare well with nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) and core measurements, whereas the new method outperforms the conventional RMS procedure, especially in the cases of gas-bearing, low-porosity organic shale. The new analytical method can be readily implemented on an Excel spreadsheet and requires minimal adjustments for its operation. "

                    "abstract": "The interpretation of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) T2 distribution as a pore size distribution assumes homogeneous surface relaxivity, single-phase fluid saturation, and the absence of diffusion of spins across pores. Although these assumptions are true for homogeneous formations with single-phase fluid saturation, they do not hold for heterogeneous formations such as deep-water carbonates, where laminations, vugs, and a mixed solid composition result in non-uniform values of surface relaxivity and diffusion of spins across pores. These spatial heterogeneities in rock formations render the interpretation of NMR logs challenging and non-conclusive. Furthermore, methods to estimate permeability, such as the Timur-Coates and the Schlumberger-Doll-Research (SDR) method assume a single relaxivity value and, thus, cannot be applied to NMR T2 data from formations with non-uniform relaxivity values. NMR mixing laws describe how to combine data acquired from homogeneous components, thus enabling us to predict the data resulting from a mixture of those homogeneous components. This paper develops a new method to interpret NMR distributions originating from highly heterogeneous formations using mixing laws for T2, T1 — T2, and T2 — D NMR data. This new method allows us to extract the magnetization decay of each homogeneous component from the total magnetization decay of the heterogeneous formation. Decomposing the magnetization decay allows us to estimate the T2 distributions for each individual rock component and use them to obtain improved estimations of petrophysical quantities of interest such as porosity, pore size distribution, and the intrinsic permeability of each homogeneous component. We show how to use the linear mixing laws in laminated formations to extract the T2 distributions from each individual component of a heterogeneous rock and how to obtain an improved estimation of the permeability of the formation.

                    "abstract": "This paper describes an extension of a recently developed fast inversion method (Pardo and Torres- Verdín (2015)) for estimating a layer-by-layer electric resistivity distribution from logging-whiledrilling (LWD) electromagnetic induction measurements. The well trajectory is arbitrary and the developed method is suitable for any commercial logging device with known antennae configurations, including tri-axial instruments. There are two key novel contributions in this work: First, the three-dimensional (3D) transversely isotropic (TI) formation is now approximated by a sequence of various “stitched” one-dimensional (1D) sections rather than by a single 1D reduced model. This provides added flexibility in order to approximate complex 3D formations. Second, we introduce the concept of “negative apparent resistivities” in the inversion method. By using the values of attenuation and phase differences that correspond to a “negative” resistivity in a homogeneous formation, the amount of data lost when converting magnetic fields into apparent resistivities is minimized, thus leading to a more robust inversion method that also convergences faster. The developed inversion method can be used to interpret LWD resistivity measurements and to adjust the well trajectory in real (logging) time. Numerical inversion results of challenging synthetic and actual field measurements confirm the high stability and superior approximation properties of the developed inversion algorithm. Because of the efficiency, flexibility, and stability of the inversion algorithm, formation-evaluation specialists can readily employ it for routine petrophysical interpretation and appraisal of complex LWD and wireline resistivity measurements acquired under general geometrical and geological constraints.

                    "abstract": "Increasingly, more high-angle (HA) and horizontal (HZ) wells have been drilled in recent years because of the accelerated development of offshore exploration and onshore organic-shale development. Conventional waveform processing methods are developed only for vertical wells. When used in HA/HZ wells, these methods may yield biased estimations of P- and S-wave slownesses. New methods are needed to process sonic waveforms acquired in HA/HZ wells, specifically in the vicinity of layer boundaries and in the presence of thin layers. This paper examines several HA/HZ borehole models when a sonic tool operates across a horizontal bed boundary. High-resolution 3D numerical simulations of sonic waveforms are carried out with a time-domain finite-difference method coupled with a complex, frequency-shifted, perfectly matched layer to study the transient acoustic fields measured in and out of the borehole. These simulations assume a 3D sonic logging tool with multipole sources and 13×8 azimuthal receivers. Both monopole and dipole synthetic waveforms are obtained in HA/HZ boreholes penetrating hard and soft formations. Instead of the conventional processing of monopole or dipole waveforms that takes the average, or difference, of waveforms acquired with azimuthal receivers, we separately analyze the sonic waveforms at each azimuthal receiver. Waveforms are first processed with a weighted spectral semblance method to yield modal dispersions; next, we reconstruct formation shear slowness from these dispersion curves with a dispersion correction method. The top and bottom receiver slowness is chosen when the tool measurement point is in the formation above and below the well, respectively. Results indicate that this new procedure provides unbiased estimations of rock formation shear slowness compared to conventional processing. Moreover, the difference between top and bottom receiver slowness reflects the elastic property contrast between the formation section above and below the well, enabling the accurate evaluation of formation heterogeneity due to bed boundary effects in HA/HZ wells. The new sonic waveform interpretation approach introduced in this paper is ideal for the elastic/mechanical assessment of organic shale, in which rock heterogeneity is commonplace. "

                    "abstract": "Unaccounted electrical conductivity anisotropy, dielectric permittivity anisotropy, and interfacial polarization of reservoir rocks can adversely affect the conventional resistivity interpretation of laboratory and subsurface electromagnetic (EM) measurements. In order to better quantify the electrical properties of reservoir rocks, we developed and tested an experimental EM laboratory apparatus, herein referred to as the Whole Core EM Induction Tool (WCEMIT). It is used for high-resolution multi-frequency measurement of complex conductivity tensor of 2-ft-long, 4-inch-diameter whole cores, continuous-feed cylindrical volumes, or test samples in the EM induction frequency range of 10 kHz to 300 kHz. The tensor functionality of this tool is sensitive to the directional nature of electrical conductivity (σ) and dielectric relative permittivity (ε r) of geomaterials, whereas its multi-frequency functionality is sensitive to the dielectric-dispersive characteristic of geomaterials. We present five laboratory-scale petrophysical applications of the WCEMIT. First, the WCEMIT is applied to the estimation of electrical conductivity and Archie’s parameters of a homogeneous isotropic whole core. A novel petrophysical application of the WCEMIT is to measure the apparent conductivity (σapp) tensor of a vuggy-whole core followed by the use of a Maxwell-Garnett effective-medium formulation of the Archie’s water-saturation equation to accurately estimate its hydrocarbon saturation. Another application implements an inversion scheme to estimate horizontal conductivity (σh), conductivity anisotropy ratio (λc), relative dip angle (θ), and azimuth angle (β) of a homogeneous polar anisotropic whole core. Finally, we put forth a novel method to measure and model the multi-frequency complex conductivity tensor of whole cores containing disseminated conductive minerals. Such whole cores exhibit large values of εr and substantial frequency dispersion due to the interfacial polarization phenomena. "

                    "abstract": "Interpretation of sonic waveforms acquired with logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools is often non-trivial in HZ/HA wells, especially in the proximity of boundaries between layers with high slowness contrasts. Low-frequency components of the quadrupole mode can be affected by deleterious superposition effects originating from the two layers, thereby biasing the assessment of formation shear slowness. Operating companies continue to report nonnegligible differences between shear slownesses measured with LWD and wireline (WL) tools in HA/HZ wells. This paper undertakes the numerical simulation and analysis of sonic waveforms acquired with LWD measurements in the vicinity of layer boundaries. Measurements simulated in HA/HZ wells are studied for quadrupole sources, and compared to WL logging results using dipole sources to estimate shear slowness. Estimations involve hard or soft formations with different contrasts in shear slowness. The HZ wells considered in this work have axes located at the interface between the two layers of the formation. For HA wells, we consider two different inclination angles. In LWD simulations with quadrupole sources in HZ wells, only the first-order quadrupole wave is detected. At high frequencies, the slowness of the detected wave is the average of the slownesses of the quadrupole waves of each layer of the formation, while at low frequencies the observed wave slowness approaches the slowness of the fastest formation. This is true when both layers are hard or soft. In WL logging simulations with dipole sources in HZ wells, we find that the behavior of the flexural wave is similar to that of the quadrupole wave only for the vertical dipole source and when both formations are soft. In HA wells, our results suggest that in formations with only soft layers, shear slowness estimation using dipole sources in WL logging is more reliable than estimation using LWD tool with quadrupole source. Our simulations show that in formations with two soft layers the effects of additional modes arising from the presence of heterogeneities may not have a significant contribution at low frequencies.

                    "abstract": "Borehole sonic measurements are widely used by the oil and gas industry to estimate elastic and mechanical properties of rock formations surrounding a wellbore. One of the major challenges in the interpretation of sonic logs is thin-bed averaging effects, which can significantly reduce the accuracy of the estimated properties. A reliable approach to accounting for averaging effects is the usage of forward modeling and inversion techniques. However, numerical simulation of wave propagation in the borehole environment requires long computation times and often inhibits the application of inversion techniques in sonic-log interpretations. This paper introduces spatial sensitivity functions for rapid simulation of borehole sonic measurements in vertical wells. The spatial sensitivity functions are equivalent to the Green’s functions of borehole modal wave measurements. Semi-analytical formulations are also developed to calculate the sensitivity functions, which involves modeling wave propagation through an effective one-dimensional layered medium. We also derive a low-frequency axial (vertical) sensitivity function of the flexural mode to quantify propagation properties of borehole non-dispersive modes. Employing semi-analytical spatial sensitivity functions for fast simulation of sonic logs, we introduce an efficient inversion method to address the problem of layer-by-layer interpretation of formation elastic properties. First, we develop a workflow to estimate shear slowness of thinly bedded formations using multi-frequency dipole flexural dispersion measurements. Then we extend the inversion approach that combines the nondispersive compressional (P-) and shear (S-) modes to estimate layer-by-layer formation compressional and shear slownesses. The new inversion-based interpretation method is verified in synthetic examples consisting of multiple horizontal thin beds with large elastic property contrasts. Gaussian noise is included in the simulated data to perform uncertainty analysis of the estimated elastic properties. The method is also applied to interpret field data measured across thinly bedded formations, which enables us to appraise its efficiency and reliability. Estimated vertical distributions of formation elastic properties are more accurate than conventional well-log analysis. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of hydrocarbon compositions is critical for optimizing oil and gas production. However, in-situ assessment of hydrocarbon properties is difficult because of environmental conditions and fluid sample quality. Fluid samples can be acquired using wireline formation testers (WFT) for laboratory analysis, but the number of samples is limited to discrete depths. Reservoir fluid samples tested in the laboratory may not exhibit the same properties as in-situ samples because the phase behavior of hydrocarbons varies significantly with temperature and pressure. Thermodynamically consistent fluid interpretations are crucial for obtaining accurate estimates of insitu hydrocarbon properties and composition. We introduce a new method to quantify in-situ hydrocarbon properties from borehole nuclear measurements. These measurements are influenced by rock fluid and matrix. After separating matrix, water, and hydrocarbon effects on borehole nuclear measurements, we use the hydrocarbon-dependent portion of the nuclear response to assess composition. Application of the new hydrocarbon composition method to two field examples, including one in a gas-oil transition zone, yielded reliable and verifiable results. Oil-viscosity values derived from NMR T2 distributions and WFT pressure data confirmed the estimated hydrocarbon composition. Our estimation method allows continuous assessment of compositional gradients at in-situ conditions and provides thermodynamically consistent interpretations of reservoir fluids that depend greatly on phase behavior. Combining nuclear and NMR measurements identifies variations within hydrocarbon columns, diagnoses reservoir connectivity, and facilitates optimized hydrocarbon production. "

                    "abstract": "Spontaneous Potential (SP) and Gamma Ray (GR) logs are often the only measurements available in many old hydrocarbon fields. Reliable coupled petrophysical interpretation of GR and SP logs requires previous accurate quantitative calibration for the effects of shale laminations, water electrolyte concentration, temperature, bed thickness, borehole diameter, hydrocarbon saturation, and invasion, among others. Although the latter effects on SP logs are well known, there is no published numerical algorithm that quantifies the relative contributions of all geometrical, petrophysical, and fluid effects on SP logs. This paper develops a new mechanistic description of SP logs for their numerical modeling and petrophysical interpretation in vertical wells penetrating horizontal layers. The main objective of the new SP modeling method is to estimate water saturation reliably in wells where only SP and GR logs are available but where resistivity and porosity calibrations can be performed in a key well within the same field or can be inferred from core data. The mechanistic SP modeling algorithm is based on the fundamental concept of anion and cation migration in aqueous solutions with unequal electrolyte concentration via diffusion and membrane potentials. It explicitly accounts for specific borehole conditions, temperature, variable shale properties, finite bed thickness, shale laminations, hydrocarbon saturation, and invasion (including salt concentration profiles) in the numerical modeling of SP logs. Further, hydrocarbon saturation effects on SP logs account for the rock’s effective throat radius. Sensitivity studies are carried out to quantify selectively the effect of each environmental and geometrical variable on measured SP logs. The modeling algorithm is also successfully used to reproduce SP logs acquired in the presence of salt and water saturation fronts in invaded hydrocarbon-saturated rocks. Examples of application include sandstone sequences that have internal shale laminations. "

Based on spectroscopy logs that have been corrected for geometrical effects, we introduce a workflow to quantify layer-by-layer matrix composition, porosity, and hydrocarbon saturation. Geometrical effects are reduced through nonlinear matrix inversion of elemental relative yields using a spectroscopy fast-forward model specific to a commercial logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool with a 14-MeV pulsed-neutron source. The spectroscopy forward model explicitly accounts for tool geometry, materials, and sensors, as well as geometrical, and borehole environmental effects on the measurements. By invoking linear mixing laws, the inversion method is adapted to quantify petrophysical properties of laminated hydrocarbon-bearing layers where conventional inversion methods fail because bed thickness is below the resolution of the LWD spectroscopy tool. Petrophysical consistency in estimated mineralogy is achieved by ensuring that matrix-sensitive nuclear properties, such as gamma ray, matrix density, matrix Sigma, and photoelectric factor (PEF), simulated with inverted mineral volumetric concentrations reproduce the available measurements. Estimated mineral compositions are used to correct matrix effects on neutron-and density-porosity logs, calculate matrix-corrected total porosity, and quantify hydrocarbon saturation through joint interpretation with fluid-sensitive logs. The developed interpretation workflow is benchmarked with synthetic and field cases to validate the accuracy and flexibility of the developed methods across a variety of well trajectories and lithologies.

The proposed semi-analytical method builds upon the idea of separating singularities from the smooth part of the integrand when performing the inverse Fourier transform. The singular part is treated analytically using existing inversion formulae, while the regular part is treated with a FFT technique. As a result, a simple and effective method that can be used for simulating and understanding the main physical principles occurring in borehole-eccentered sonic measurements is obtained.

To do so, a previously developed finite-difference reservoir model is coupled with a streamline method to simulate the near-wellbore dynamic measurements in the presence of invasion and arbitrary fluid distributions. The streamline method is specifically developed to overcome technical challenges in modeling deviated wells in heterogeneous reservoirs efficiently. In this study, synthetic reservoir models are constructed based on measurements acquired in offshore well A with 15o deviation angle. The streamline-based method is then implemented to simulate packer-type formation-tester measurements and to appraise permeability of multi-layer reservoirs. In addition, transient measurements from a focused-sampling probe-type formation tester is modeled with streamline method to estimate relative permeability and anisotropy in offshore well B. Inversion results indicate that the accuracy of estimated formation properties is higher for formations with larger mobility because more streamlines trace flow into probes from large-mobility layers. For offshore well A, in the presence of 5% zero-mean Gaussian additive noise, the uncertainty of permeability varies from 6% to 38% for layers with high and low mobilities, respectively. The uncertainty increases to 8% and 41% for high and low mobility cases, respectively, when 5% skewed-Gaussian noise contaminates the measurements. The coupled finite-difference and streamline-based inversion method (FDSM) is then compared to a previously validated finite-difference reservoir model (FDM). The coupled FDSM is 8 times faster than FDM on an average when estimating properties of heterogeneous reservoirs using inversion on formation-tester measurements acquired in highly deviated wells. Computational advantage of FDSM is due to application of one-dimensional solutions of fluid saturations and concentrations along streamlines instead of three-dimensional FDM numerical calculations. Despite the efficiency, history matching of measurements indicates up to 6% difference between FDSM and FDM in results. In high-angle wells, mud-filtrate invasion causes a non-symmetric distribution of invading fluid around the wellbore perimeter. Moreover, presence of large permeability–porosity contrast among layers increases complexity of numerical computations and uncertainty. This study proposes that the streamline-based inversion method is an excellent candidate to overcome these difficulties efficiently. "

The field examples consist of highly-deviated, HA, and HZ wells drilled across thinly-bedded and anisotropic calcite-cemented siltstone formations.

                    "abstract": "Miscalculations of matrix composition can lead to appreciable errors in matrix density, porosity, and ultimately hydrocarbon saturation. Spectroscopy logs are the most direct method for estimating element concentrations and mineralogy in-situ. The increasing complexity of well trajectories and pervasive heterogeneity of unconventional rock formations make it necessary to account for geometrical and shoulder-bed effects on spectroscopy logs. Accounting for such effects requires an efficient and accurate three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation procedure. We introduce a new method to rapidly simulate logging-while-drilling (LWD) 3D spectroscopy measurements. The simulation method is suitable for interpretation of measurements acquired in high-angle and horizontal (HA/HZ) wells penetrating thinly bedded formations. It is based on pre-computed Monte Carlo based flux sensitivity functions (FSFs), which synthesize the physics of neutron capture and subsequent gamma ray emission. In addition to conventional capture gamma ray responses resulting from low neutron energy (<0.5MeV) interactions, the method accounts for inelastic gamma ray spectroscopy measurements arising from higher neutron energy interactions (>0.5MeV). Inelastic spectroscopy measurements are necessary in unconventional reservoirs to estimate kerogen and total organic carbon content (TOC) in-situ. The rapid simulation method yields gamma ray spectroscopy logs in 0.003 seconds of CPU time per logging station compared to 20 hours using Monte Carlo calculations, with differences smaller than 2% between the two methods’ results. An iterative nonlinear inversion algorithm is implemented using the developed forward simulation method to estimate layer-by-layer elemental compositions together with specific mineral compositions and their associated uncertainties. We avoid common mineral groupings which lead to erroneous compositional results using the stoichiometric relationship between each element and mineral. The estimation is successfully implemented with measurements acquired in gas-bearing shale and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate formations. Results indicate corrections of 20% in element and mineral estimations in 1ft beds where, additionally, certain chemical elements are falsely detected by well logs because of unaccounted shoulder-bed effects.

                    "abstract": "This paper is the first part of a two-part series introducing a new and innovative managed temperature drilling technique for strengthening the wellbores of challenging oil and gas wells. This technique relies on heat generation within the borehole to increase the effective fracture gradient of near-wellbore zones in oil and gas wells. By releasing heat at exactly the right time and at the right location, the temperature in a near-wellbore zone can be raised, which in turn raises thermal stresses in this zone. This results in “thermal wellbore strengthening”, i.e. an increase in near-wellbore fracture initiation and propagation pressure that can be exploited to prevent or minimize induced mud losses during drilling, cementing and completion operations. As shown in Part II of this series, the heat-release is preferably achieved in a delayed fashion through the use of exothermic “heat-releasing” particles that are circulated to the zone(s) of interest in a dedicated carrier fluid. Part I describes a new computational thermal model for the proposed technique. Using finite volume techniques for an axisymmetric cylindrical geometry including a drillstring/workstring with internal and external fluid spaces, a casing string and a cementing layer (if present), and the rock formation, the model calculates the near-wellbore formation temperature as well as annulus and drill string temperature when a time-dependent and location-dependent heat generation source is acting. Model validation was conducted by comparing the simulation results from the model to analytical solutions as well as results obtained with a commercial software package for simplified cases (1D along the wellbore) with no heat source. Subsequently, near-wellbore temperature distributions were calculated for varying heat generation rates and fluid circulation times, and passed on to a geomechanical model to estimate the magnitude of the thermal strengthening effects on the fracture gradient. Results show that meaningful increases in near-wellbore stress can be obtained by the technique. The thermal wellbore strengthening technique, supported by the new thermal model described here, can be used to minimize lost circulation events and associated well trouble time and cost during drilling, cementing and completion operations, and may be particularly suited for wells with low drilling margins such as (ultra-)deepwater wells.

                    "abstract": "Extensive research has been conducted over the past two decades to improve hydraulic fracturing methods used for hydrocarbon recovery from tight reservoir rocks such as shales. Our focus in this paper is on thermal fracturing of such tight rocks to enhance hydraulic fracturing efficiency. Thermal fracturing is effective in generating small fractures in the near-wellbore zone - or in the vicinity of natural or induced fractures - that may act as initiation points for larger fractures. Previous analytical and numerical results indicate that thermal fracturing in tight rock significantly enhances rock permeability, thereby enhancing hydrocarbon recovery. Here, we present a more powerful way of simulating the initiation and propagation of thermally induced fractures in tight formations using the Cohesive Zone Method (CZM). The advantages of CZM are: 1) CZM simulation is fast compared to similar models which are based on the spring-mass particle method or Discrete Element Method (DEM); 2) unlike DEM, rock material complexities such as scale-dependent failure behavior can be incorporated in a CZM simulation; 3) CZM is capable of predicting the extent of fracture propagation in rock, which is more difficult to determine in a classic finite element approach. We demonstrate that CZM delivers results for the challenging fracture propagation problem of similar accuracy to the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) while reducing complexity and computational effort. Simulation results for thermal fracturing in the near-wellbore zone show the effect of stress anisotropy in fracture propagation in the direction of the maximum horizontal stress. It is shown that CZM can be used to readily obtain the extent and the pattern of induced thermal fractures. "

                    "abstract": "This paper is the second part of a two-part series introducing a new and innovative managed temperature drilling technique for thermal wellbore strengthening of challenging oil and gas wells. It describes the development of heat-releasing (“exothermic”) coated particles designed to release heat at exactly the right circulating time to increase near-wellbore formation temperature and thermal stress in potential lost circulation zones, such as depleted reservoir zones in deepwater wells. The increase in thermal stress directly elevates the near-wellbore tangential stress, which translates into an increase in the effective fracture gradient. This may lower the risk of lost circulation, and also improve the chance of successfully cementing casing and achieving zonal isolation. In the latter application, a treatment can be executed as an integral part of the cement job by using it in an extended spacer train for mud displacement, pumped directly prior to cement placement to thermally strengthen a formation. The coated exothermic particles, which were based on the hygroscopic calcium and magnesium salts with chlorine and bromine, were designed such that they could release their “payload” via an extended time-release mechanism, to ensure that the heat release reaches the appropriate target location in the wellbore at exactly the right time. The chemical candidate systems were found to effectively heat up the wellbore and increase temperature up to 90 °C. This, in turn, will elevate the fracture gradient by several hundred psi, depending on formation properties. The particles need to be transported to the target formation and their reaction products need to be carried away from the target formation by a suitable carrier fluid that can handle the exothermic dissolution of a large amount of salt without any instability. Details regarding the formulation and testing of non-coated and coated particles and their carrier fluid are discussed here, as well as considerations for field application of thermal wellbore strengthening. The developed managed temperature drilling technique, enabled by the chemical system described here, can be used to minimize lost circulation events and associated well trouble time and cost during drilling, cementing and completion operations.

                    "abstract": "Substantial volumes of data are collected during modern drilling operations. However, the business value of such data is limited unless it can be analyzed quickly to derive practical knowledge for application on subsequent wells. The sheer quantity and messiness of data can overwhelm oilfield personnel, making it difficult for them to extract value. An automated process is necessary to extract knowledge quickly and efficiently from large datasets. Our team identified a preliminary set of 12 questions with answers that provide immediate knowledge to help improve the drilling of subsequent wells. Each of these ten questions is best answered through a storyboarding process. The process involves the automatic creation of a series of one-page visuals with just the right amount of information on each page to validate the answers to the questions. Standardizing the structure of the data (well-site data, survey data, geology data, well plans, etc.) enables software to rapidly create these visuals and is an important step in the process. This work describes how the storyboarding process was applied to a dataset of more than 100 gigabytes (GB) from 16 shale wells drilled in North America. Examples of questions that could be quickly answered using the process are: ‘What was the best drilled well on the pad?’ and ‘Did a particular bottom hole assembly (BHA) improve drilling in a particular section of the well?’ Scripts were written in Matlab and Python to automatically process the raw data and generate more than 20 different types of one-page visuals that are well suited to present the answers to such questions. The illustrated information includes insights into BHA performance, wellbore tortuosity and quality, vibrations, weight on bit transfer, and other drilling dynamics. Identifying the relevant KPIs to satisfactorily answer the questions and present exactly the right information from the vast amounts of data was a challenge. This paper documents and describes the concept of storyboarding that uses visuals to answer comprehensive questions. This concept is not yet widely applied in the drilling industry today, but is expected to be quickly adopted by stakeholders interested in drilling performance improvement and cost saving opportunities.

                    "abstract": "Fluid-shale compatibility testing is as old as the drilling fluid industry itself, and remains a highly relevant topic as drilling applications explore new, more complex territory. Incompatibilities of fluids with clay-rich shale formations can lead to a plethora of operational problems, ranging from minor dispersion and accretion issues to major stuck pipe and production impairment events. The nature of fluid-shale interactions has confounded scientists since the birth of the drilling fluid industry, and has led to a variety of different test methods and protocols, many now decades old. The question remains: what are the best, most representative fluid-shale compatibility tests to characterize fluid-shale interactions and avoid making costly mistakes based on misleading test results? Historical fluid-shale compatibility tests are often severely limited by over-emphasizing the role of clay swelling behavior, by not paying attention to shale sample condition, and by not being specific with regard to the intended purpose. Test selection is often based on a superficial assessment of the \"reactivity\" of the shale, and results are indiscriminately applied whether the intended purpose is maintaining cuttings integrity, promoting borehole stability or avoiding reservoir incompatibility to name a few. This paper points out the various pitfalls and problems associated with conventional tests such as atmospheric swelling tests and capillary suction time tests, which still find wide-scale application in the oil and gas industry. A case is made to abandon such tests in future. New sets of tests are proposed that may overcome the drawbacks of the conventional tests. These tests are also conducted with a clear purpose in mind. For instance, to evaluate borehole stability, it is argued to forego traditional swelling tests and instead focus on triaxial failure testing, mud pressure transmission testing and borehole collapse testing. The latter can be accomplished with a novel, low-cost alternative to the downhole simulation cell test in the form of a modified thick walled cylinder test. This new test exposes cylindrical shale samples, confined under downhole temperature and pressure, to mud formulations at overbalance for a specified period of time and assesses the failure strength of the sample thereafter. Recommendations for shale characterization and to investigate fluid shale interactions relevant to shale cuttings integrity, borehole stability and reservoir compatibility for conventional and unconventional reservoirs are given here. The tests are illustrated with representative results obtained for novel mud systems such as high-salinity fluids and muds containing nano-particles. Recommendations with respect to applying laboratory results to field operations are provided. "

                    "abstract": "Non-aqueous drilling fluids (such as synthetic-based mud) are frequently used to drill one or more sections of an oil/gas well to reduce drilling problems such as shale sloughing, wellbore stability, and stuck pipe. However, solubility of formation gas in such fluids makes early gas detection and thereby the well control process very challenging. This is of particular concern in deep offshore wells, in which large amount of gas can be dissolved in non-aqueous drilling fluids under high pressure and temperature conditions. The gas remains in solution until the bubble point is reached. Thereafter, a sudden release of gas at shallow depth can compromise wellbore and riser integrity, particularly when the gas has passed the blow out preventer installed at the seafloor. An advanced planning tool to simulate the transient multi-phase phenomena associated with gas kicks in non-aqueous drilling fluids is therefore highly desirable. This paper presents a novel and comprehensive hydraulic model with associated calculation routines and software to simulate a gas kick in non-aqueous drilling fluids. A transient drift-flux approach based on conservation of mass and momentum was applied in association with appropriate algebraic closure equations and sophisticated friction and choke models. Advanced numerical schemes, where applied previously, have been modified to handle the mass transfer between the liquid (mud) and gas phases. In addition, PVT models have been included to investigate and predict the effect of gas solubility in various types of drilling fluids. The calculation routines contained in a new software tool predict crucial parameters during well construction such as pit gain, gas break out location and void fraction, annular pressure profile, kick tolerance, choke opening, flow-out, standpipe and casing pressures. Simulation results generated using the tool are presented here for both water-based and synthetic-based muds to illustrate the impact of gas solubility on kick behavior. The tool can handle several other complexities which occur during a well control incident such as multiple influxes from one or several formations, dynamic well control (suitable for managed pressure drilling), automated choke control, sudden pump startup/shutdown, non-Newtonian drilling fluids, arbitrary wellbore path, lost circulation, etc. Applying advanced numerical schemes associated with relevant PVT models and several types of boundary conditions makes the tool comprehensive, unique, robust, and efficient for well control analysis for a variety of complex drilling scenarios, particularly deepwater wells. As such, it has the potential to enhance well control operations and well design, thereby enhancing rig safety and reducing non-productive time and cost associated with well control-related events.

                    "abstract": "The context of drilling operations is quite variable in geometric scale and complexity. Wells range from Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) wells with measured depths greater than 10 km to exceptionally shallow wells no longer than 2 km but only 200–300 m in true vertical depth. With the objective of achieving greater levels of drilling automation, it is important to understand how the well geometrical scale impacts drillability and the management of drilling incidents. The robust control of the drilling process necessitates the correct management of delays in the system. Some sources of delay are directly linked to physical dimensions, while others are the results of the system infrastructure. Time delays due to the travel of information through a medium belong to the first category while delays due to signal filtering or processing and actuator latency belong to the second category. The transient response of the drilling system greatly influences the controllability of the drilling process and both the detection and reaction times for drilling incidents such as over-pulls or pack-offs. This paper proposes a categorization of the various sources of delay in a drilling system. A brief review of similar sources of delay in other industries is presented first, and then the sources of delay are characterized into four classes: the elasticity, inertia, and friction of the physical system, measurement refresh rate and latency, processing latency, and maximum actuator acceleration. Delays within these four classes are quantified for three different scenarios: a 10 km-long ERD well, a shallow horizontal well, and a three-dimensional shale well. Illustrative examples of the four classes of delay are presented within these scenarios. Any drilling automation system faces a varying set of constraints for each application, which should influence both the automation procedures themselves as well as sensing requirements. The paper illustrates how scale influences the necessary constraints in drilling procedures, by comparing the delay within the full range of drilling scenarios. Human operator and rig system reaction time and variable awareness to drilling dysfunctions are the most limiting factors in improving drilling efficiency. The automation of drilling procedures with robustness considerations for scale and latency issues therefore plays an important role in increasing drilling performance. "

                    "abstract": "Cement displacement efficiency significantly affects the quality of a well cementing job. Inefficient displacement of drilling fluids by spacers and cement slurry results in poor placement and potential contamination of the cement, which in turn can compromise cement integrity and threaten zonal isolation of oil and gas wells. In this paper, a novel method is introduced to monitor the cement displacement process in real time using fiber optic distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) technologyas drilling fluid, spacer and cement are pumped through the casing annuli.An advanced DTSS system, based on hybrid Brillouin and Rayleigh backscattering, was used in combination with a specially designed fiber optic cable to identify the location of each fluid (i.e. drilling fluid, spacer fluid and cement slurry) during the cement displacement process. The fiber optic cable consists of a single-mode optical fiber packaged with a polymer that has selective sensitivity to various well construction fluids, and thus can be used to detect the presence of each fluid. Both strain and temperature changes were monitored by the DTSS system to track the cement displacement process. When the proposed fiber optic cable was exposed to synthetic-based mud (SBM) and spacer fluid, the strain values recorded by the fiber differed by a few orders of magnitude. When the cable is exposed to cement slurry, the location of cement can be determined from its exothermic heat release signature, which is apparent in both strain and temperature measurements. Contamination of cement slurry with drilling fluid was found to have a significant impact on the strain and temperature profiles. Thus, the DTSS system can provide useful information regarding top of cement (TOC), the wait-on-cement (WOC) time and the displacement efficiency in real time. Cement displacement of drilling fluids and spacer fluids has been modeled in the past; however, to date the displacement process and the locations of these fluids have never been tracked and verified in real time. This paper presents a new way for real-time, in-situ, continuous, and non-disruptive monitoring of the cement displacement process and tracking of the well construction fluids. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced fiber optic distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system designed for real-time in-situ monitoring of cement presence and integrity in the annuli of an oil and gas well. The DTSS system is used to monitor cement quality and zonal isolation by application of hybrid Brillouin and Rayleigh technology. This sophisticated technology allows for separate strain and temperature measurements using a single optical fiber. The DTSS system enables monitoring of the exothermic cement hydration reactions after a cement slurry is displaced into an annular space and allowed to set. In the laboratory, temperature and strain profiles were measured using the DTSS system at various external temperatures to quantify the effect of heat release during cement hydration. The temperature measurements showed excellent agreement with those obtained from thermocouples embedded in the same cement samples for comparison. Contamination of cement due to incomplete displacement of drilling fluid by cement slurry was also considered in the experiments. Contamination with synthetic-based drilling fluid was found to decrease the amount of heat generated during the cement hydration reactions. The degree of cement hydration and the presence of cement in the annular space - or lack thereof - can therefore be quantified. It is shown that the temperature profiles measured using the DTSS system can be used to detect both the top of cement (TOC) as well as annular sections that are either left uncemented or contaminated with drilling fluid. In addition to monitoring cement hydration, specially designed fiber optic sensing cables were developed to detect the presence and migration of hydrocarbons in cemented annuli, which may occur either because the cement is absent or compromised by cracking/fracturing. The fiber optic cables were modified with hydrocarbon-sensitive coatings generating a swelling effect when exposed to hydrocarbons. Such swelling effect could be measured and quantified using an induced strain on the fiber optic cable, which is monitored and recorded by the DTSS system. The modified cable was also evaluated for its response to various well construction fluids (such as synthetic based drilling fluid, spacers etc.). The ability to monitor cement hydration and hydrocarbon presence behind casing using cement-embedded fiber optic sensors that provide real-time, continuous responses without the need for wellbore re-entry presents a powerful new tool to assess and verify the quality of zonal isolation over the entire lifecycle of the well.

Their aim is for this new material to be used at natural gas gathering facilities where it will absorb carbon dioxide from natural gas streams while allowing the methane product to pass through. JPT featured the work in 2014 and, since then, the researchers say they have figured out how to optimize their process to make the material, described as a porous-carbon sorbent, to address the different chemical makeups of natural gas sources. The project has received funding from US independent operator Apache Corporation. The latest details were published last month in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal, Sustainable Energy & Fuels.  US Gulf of Mexico Hits Record Production Trent Jacobs, JPT Digital Editor Average oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico reached a new benchmark of 1.6 million B/D in 2016, topping the previous record set in 2009 by 44,000 B/D. January’s average production reached 1.7 million B/D, marking a fourth straight month of increases for the offshore region. These figures were published by the US Energy Information Agency (EIA), which predicts that crude output from the US Gulf will continue to rise into 2018. Last year, there were eight offshore projects commissioned in the offshore basin, including Shell’s 50,000 B/D Stones floating production facility that started up in September and Anadarko’s 80,000 B/D Heidelberg spar platform which achieved first oil in January. Seven more projects are slated to start up this year.  Foamer Developed To Help Corrosion, Scale Inhibition Stephen Whitfield, Senior Staff Writer Wet-gas production in east and central Texas can often be a complicated process, as corrosive fluids in gas wells often lead to significant deposition of iron sulfide scale in production tubing. Speaking at the SPE Oil-field Chemistry Conference, Jonathan Wylde discussed the challenges in creating a chemical component to deliquefy gas wells while reducing corrosion and preventing iron sulfide scale. Wylde is the global head of application development at Clariant Oil Services. The gas wells are located in the Teague field in east central Texas. There are several producing reservoirs in the field, but the Upper Jurassic Bossier and Cotton Valley Lime reservoirs are the most prolific. Wylde said the gas produced by the two reservoirs has different characteristics, which indicates that they come from different source rock despite being in the same field. The Bossier Sands are a blend of centered gas accumulations and prograding deltaic channel systems with minimal formation water, and the Cotton Valley Lime is an oolitic shoal trend with higher porosity zones that can produce significant amounts of water and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).  University Consortium Prepares for Spike in Decommissioning Eric van Oort, Director, Consortium for Decommissioning and Abandonment In the music world, a coda is the final section of a movement or composition. Appropriately, it is also the acronym for the Consortium for Decommissioning and Abandonment (CODA), a University of Texas at Austin (UT)-led initiative that is designed to bring together members of industry and academia to help operators efficiently orchestrate the final days of deepwater developments. The CODA is a response to the growing number of onshore and offshore wells, platforms, and infrastructure that are approaching the end of economic viability and soon must be plugged and removed. In the Gulf of Mexico deep water alone, for example, 2015 abandonment costs were estimated by IHS Markit to be about USD 2.5 billion. That number is expected to rise by more than 500% to USD 13.2 billion by 2040. Abandonment expenses are particularly onerous to operators because unlike other operating costs, plug and abandonment (P&A) operations offer no prospect for return on investment. The consortium is working to minimize the economic impact on operators and to ensure effective P&A operations through the development of innovative technologies. The approach replicates industry efforts over past decades to develop new technologies with which to drill and complete wells in various challenging environments around the world. "

                    "abstract": "The operational use of nanoparticles (NPs) in drilling and completion fluids is still limited at the present time, in part due to lack of consistent evidence for - and clarification of - NP interactions with rock formations, formation fluid, and other fluid additives. For instance, previous fluids research has emphasized that NPs bring about \"pore plugging\" that reduces pressure transmission, and in turn fluid inflow, into the shale pore matrix which ultimately helps stabilize the borehole. However, it is difficult to understand how pore plugging might be accomplished in the absence of any considerable filtration in shales considering the very low permeability of shales does not allow for any appreciable Darcy flow. This paper addresses the crucial question: \"how, when, why do nanoparticles plug up shale pore throats?\" Zeta Potential (ZP) measurements were carried out on the aqueous dispersions (NPs) and on intact shale thin sections exposed to the nanofluid in order to determine the degree of interaction behavior between NPs and shales. The experimental data was then used to calculate DLVO curves (describes the force between charged surfaces interacting through a liquid medium) in order to determine if the total potential energy was sufficient for NP's to diffuse through the repulsive barrier and attract (or overcome repulsion) to the shale surface. Estimated DLVO curves are used to demonstrate the NP's ability to contribute to borehole stability but are not directly correlated, and therefore, NP effects on shale stability were studied in detail using pore pressure transmission tests (PTT), which measure fluid pressure penetration in shales, and modified Thick Wall Collapse (TWC) tests, which explore the influence of NPs on the collapse pressure of shale samples. Our investigation shows that NPs can reduce fluid pressure penetration and delay borehole collapse in shales, but only under certain conditions. Electrostatic and electrodynamic interaction between NP's and shale surfaces, governed by DLVO forces, is the main mechanism that will lead to pore throat plugging, reducing pressure transmission, which in turn benefits borehole stability by slowing down near-wellbore pore-pressure elevation and effective stress reduction. For Mancos shale, it was shown that 20 nm nanosilica (anionic) are effective in partially plugging the pore throat system, depending on the pH of the nanofluid, which affects the surface potential and ZP of both NPs and shale. Furthermore, the positively charged nanosilica (cationic) showed better results for pore-plugging capabilities than the anionic nanosilica. The findings lead to some interesting challenges for the practical field application of NP-based drilling fluids for borehole stability, given that efficacy will depend on the specific type of shale, the specific type, size and concentration of NP, the interaction between NP-shale, and external factors such as pH, salinity, temperature etc. NP use for practical shale stabilization therefore requires a dedicated, thoroughly engineered solution for each particular field application, and is unlikely to be \"one size fits all\".

While the current literature on geopolymers primarily focuses on the construction industry, this work was aimed at studying the potential use of novel geopolymers for well construction applications such as primary cementing and lost circulation control. It was recently discovered that hydroxide-activated geopolymers have the ability to solidify non-aqueous drilling fluids (NAFs, i.e. with synthetic or oil based muds) up to 60/40 geopolymer/mud ratio (by volume). The primary benefits of such a blend include better compatibility of the slurry with NAFs, reduced risk of poor cementation, inexpensive source material as well as an environmentally friendly on-site/in-situ disposal of NAFs. The rheological properties, short-term and long-term compressive strengths of the geopolymer/NAF blend can be tailored to any specific application. In this work, the effects of pressure, oil/water ratio variation and internal brine phase composition in the NAFs were systematically studied. Both liquid-form and solid-form sodium silicate activators were used to form silicate-activated geopolymers. The slurry design was targeted for specific applications. For lost circulation control, the geopolymer slurries were deliberately blended with non-aqueous drilling fluids to achieve rapid gelation and setting characteristics. "

The objectives were to maximize the value derived from data, establish an analysis toolkit, and train students on data analytics—a necessary job function of any future drilling engineer. The operator provided data sets, business and technical objectives, and guidance for the project, while a multi-disciplinary group of undergraduate and graduate students piloted an analysis workflow. The students developed methods to: 1) understand and clean the data; 2) structure, combine, and condense information; 3) visualize, benchmark, and interpret the data, as well as derive key performance indicators (KPIs); and 4) automate these processes. The operator provided data collected from drilling 16 wells in an US unconventional play. The large data sets comprised of un-organized time and depth based information from surface and downhole sensors, daily drilling reports, geological information, etc. Students were trained on specialized software and subsequently curated data into smaller sizes and standard formats. Students investigated bottom hole assembly (BHA) and directional drilling performance using a combination of auto-generated conventional visuals (e.g., BHA designs, annotated time vs depth curves) and newly developed tools (e.g., tortuosity, 3D well trajectory plots combined with operational data). Methods for ‘push a button' investigations of mechanic specific energy (MSE), vibration, torque and drag were also developed by calculating specific KPIs from the raw measurement data. The analysis work itself coupled with the attempt to improve the workflow processes served as a meaningful and highly effective way to educate students and prepare them to be the \"drilling engineers of the future\" with proficiency in data analytics.

                    "abstract": "Wellbore instability and stuck pipe incidents are large contributors to drilling-related non-productive time (NPT). Drilling cuttings/cavings monitoring is crucial for early detection and mitigation of such events. Currently, monitoring is done manually and lacks a streamlined approach. Automating this process would be very beneficial, and is possible due to recent advances in sensing technology. Real-time cuttings/cavings monitoring can be used to quantify cuttings volume, measure size distribution, and analyze shape. By correlating these measurements with ongoing drilling operations, the hole condition (in particular hole cleaning/cuttings transport efficiency, wellbore stability situation, etc.) can be automatically assessed in real-time. This makes pro-active prevention and mitigation of NPT related to hole cleaning and wellbore instability possible. In this paper, we detail a system designed and prototyped to allow us to measure cuttings/cavings in real-time. A highly portable device employs a 2D high-resolution camera and a 3D laser sensor to determine the physical properties of cuttings. The 3D point cloud/depth data obtained by this device provides cuttings size distribution, volume and shape characteristics. Comparisons and discrepancies between expected and sensed quantities can then be used for alarming purposes and taking appropriate corrective action. A prototype experimental setup was constructed to evaluate the ability to quantify relevant cuttings properties and profiles in the presence of drilling fluids. In a controlled environment, the cuttings slide down a shaker table's clearing chute while simulating various realistic external variable scenarios. The environmental impact on the accuracy, repeatability and robustness of the various sensors under investigation was determined to identify the sensors best suited for the task at hand. The optimum device configuration was then implemented and evaluated to verify that the system is viable for use in the field. The automated cuttings monitoring system can warn drillers to potential hazards associated with poor hole cleaning conditions, ongoing wellbore breakout, and the likelihood of stuck pipe events. "

                    "abstract": "Targeting the incompatibility issue between traditional Portland cements and non-aqueous drilling muds, a mud solidification technique based on geopolymer cements was recently introduced to the industry. This technique was achieved by incorporating non-aqueous fluids (NAF) such as synthetic-based or oil-based drilling mud in a geopolymer cement that is formed by blending an aluminosilicate powder with an alkaline activating solution. In a previously completed study, the consolidated mud, or \"geopolymer hybrid\", was evaluated for its compressive strength, thickening time and stability for applications including primary cementing as well as lost circulation control. In an effort to further develop the geopolymer hybrid system as a new generation well cementing material, the present work comprehensively studies their mechanical properties, self-healing capabilities and cement-to-pipe bond strength. One of the concerns currently preventing the use of geopolymers for well cementing is its low early compressive strength. This study shows that although the early age uniaxial compressive strength of geopolymer is lower than that of Portland cement, with an applied confining stress, geopolymers have more than sufficient strength for primary cementing applications. Furthermore, the abilities of cement to properly bond with steel casing and rock formations, as well as to withstand subsurface stress changes over time are of paramount importance for long-term cement integrity. The triaxial tests performed in this study show that geopolymers are less brittle than Portland cement, and can therefore accommodate stress changes without localized failure. The geopolymer bond strength measurements showed that geopolymer could bond to steel even in presence of non-aqueous drilling muds. In addition, the triaxial tests revealed that geopolymers exhibit true self-healing capabilities, characterized by samples fully regaining their mechanical competence with 28 day post-failure strength exceeding the native 7-day strength. Portland cement, in comparison, retained lower ultimate strength than its 7-day strength. The self-healing capability of geopolymers is ideally suited to adapt to subsurface stress changes, making such materials ideally suited for use as permanent barriers in plug and abandonment operations.

                    "abstract": "Tor/Ekofisk wells drilled in the Danish sector of the North Sea have historically suffered from borehole instability problems when intersecting the Upper/Lower Lark and Horda shale formations using either water-based mud (WBM) or oil-based mud (OBM). An extensive wellbore stability investigation was carried out, focused primarily on improving shale-fluid compatibility. It was augmented by a lookback analysis of historical drilling operations in order to identify practical solutions to the borehole instability problems. A state-of-the-art experimental rock mechanics and shale-fluids compatibility investigation was carried out featuring X-ray diffraction and cation exchange capacity characterizations, shale accretion, cuttings dispersion, mud pressure transmission and a new type of borehole collapse test for 11 different mud systems (WBM, OBM and high-performance WBM). The results of this investigation were then combined with the results of a comprehensive well lookback study. The integrated study clearly identified the root cause(s) of the Tor/Ekofisk well problems and highlighted comprehensive practical solutions, which were subsequently implemented in the field. The borehole instability problems at Tor/Ekofisk in the Lark/Horda shales have a characteristic time-dependency, with wellbore cavings occurring after 3-5 days of open-hole time. The problems were not related to mud weight selection, but were instead caused by mud pressure invasion into the shales, which destabilizes them over time. An extensive experimental testing program revealed that this effect occurs in both WBM and OBM to equal extent, which explains why non-optimum field performance has historically been obtained with both types of mud systems. New high-performance WBM (HP-WBM) formulations were identified that significantly improve upon the mud pressure invasion and borehole collapse behavior of conventional OBM and WBM systems, yielding extended open hole time that would allow the hole sections in the Lark/Horda shales to be drilled, cased and cemented without triggering large-scale instability. Lookback review also indicated that secondary causes of wellbore instability, such as barite sag, extensive backreaming and associate drillstring vibrations should be minimized for optimum drilling performance. A new HPWBM system, together with improved operational guidelines, was successfully implemented in the field. "

This paper proposes a feedback controller based on frequency-domain loop-shaping techniques for torsional vibration mitigation in drillstrings. The new feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is stable with adequate gain margin for robustness. As a proof of concept, a 35 degree of freedom lumped mass drill string laboratory testbed was developed that utilizes precision inertial masses and a state-of-the-art motion tracking system. The physical testbed is used to tune and verify the mathematical model upon which feedback controller is built. The controller is also tested on the physical testbed. Using the physical testbed, the performance of the controller is compared with the existing techniques that are applied in the field, such as the Soft Torque Rotary System. Significant performance increases are observed. The closed loop system with the proposed controller exhibits much less bit velocity increase after a stick phase, which is thought to be one of the main contributing factors to bit and bottom-hole assembly (BHA) damage. The controller also effectively mitigates the self-excited vibrations during drilling speed changes. Frequency-domain loop-shaping techniques are applied extensively in the Aerospace field. However, it is not yet applied in drilling. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of this new methodology of developing high performance feedback controllers for stick-slip mitigation. From an operational perspective, the effective elimination of unwanted bit velocity increase would significantly reduce bit damage and off-bottom time, and in turn improve drilling performance. "

Optimum displacement requires understanding of flow patterns, frictional pressure losses and mutual interactions of mud, spacers and cement in annular spaces. Modeling this complex behavior is very difficult, but understanding it is essential to guarantee displacement success. A state-of-the-art cement displacement study was carried out using the very latest in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling techniques, to identify practical guidelines and solutions to cement displacement challenges. A state-of-the-art 3D \"3-phase\" (i.e. mud-spacer-cement phases) CFD model was created and simulations were carried out, featuring tracking of fluid interfaces during displacement, calculation of frictional pressure drops, and characterization of complex flow profiles. These simulations accounted for the effects of such complexities as non-Newtonian rheological behavior of all fluids involved, eccentric / narrow annuli, and pipe movement / rotation. The integrated study clearly identifies the root cause(s) of cement displacement failures and highlights comprehensive practical solutions, which are proposed for implementation in field operations. There are many causes for cement displacement problems and failures, including poor borehole conditioning, inappropriate displacement flow rates, insufficient casing centralization, viscosity contrast mismatches between mud-spacer-cement leading to interface instabilities, etc. Our high-resolution finite element study quantifies the effects of many of these causes and highlights parameters that can improve displacement, such as avoiding high shear strength in non-Newtonian mud and cement rheology, reducing pipe eccentricity and applying pipe rotation during displacement. The modeling approach is used to identify optimum parameters values, and studies interdependencies between factors, for instance determining optimum rheology, flow rate and pipe rotation speeds when pipe is placed eccentrically in the hole, in order to maximize the probability of displacement success in the field. Particularly revealing are the non-intuitive results obtained while modeling mud, spacer and cement as non-Newtonian yield power law (YPL) fluids, which has never been done before.

The experimental set-up offers full control over borehole, confining, and pore pressures. Fracturing experiments were conducted on cylindrical Berea sandstone samples. Several injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to measure the Fracture Initiation Pressure (FIP) and the stable Fracture Propagation Pressure (FPP) at various confining pressures. The measured FIP values were compared with Hubbert and Willis’ model, and Rummel's model. The stable FPPs were measured using synthetic based mud (SBM) with and without lost circulation material (LCM), and compared with the large-scale fracturing experiments conducted at the Drilling Engineering Association (DEA) 13 investigation. Our study shows that initiation of a drilling induced fracture (DIF) is best characterized by a fracture mechanics approach such as Rummel's model. The stable FPP value changes linearly with the minimum horizontal stress (Shmin), and it is independent of the maximum horizontal stress (Shmax) or the vertical stress (Sv). Also, we show that adding LCM to the drilling fluids significantly enhances the stable FPP. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced fiber optic distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) system designed for real-time in-situ monitoring of cement annuli in an oil and gas well. The DTSS system used in this study of cement quality and zonal isolation uses both Brillouin and Rayleigh backscattering phenomena, allowing one to separate strain and temperature using a single optical fiber. The first part of the paper focuses on monitoring the exothermic cement hydration process after a cement slurry is displaced into an annular space. In the laboratory, temperature and strain profiles were measured independently using the DTSS system and thermocouples at various temperatures to quantify the effect of heat release during cement hydration. These independent temperature measurements showed excellent agreement. Contamination of cement due to incomplete displacement of drilling muds by cement slurry was also simulated in the experiments. Contamination was found to decrease the amount of heat generated during the cement hydration process. The degree of cement hydration and the presence of cement in the annular space – or lack thereof - could thereby be quantified. It is shown that the temperature profiles measured using the hybrid-DTSS system can be used to detect both the top of cement (TOC) as well as annular sections that are either left uncemented or contaminated with drilling fluid. This is highly relevant information, because contamination of cement is one of the main factors that negatively affects zonal isolation directly by creating paths for hydrocarbon migration or indirectly by weakening the cement, making it susceptible to damage from cyclical pressure/temperature loads. In addition to monitoring cement hydration, specially designed fiber optic sensing cables were used to detect the presence and migration of hydrocarbons in cemented annuli, either because the cement was absent or compromised by cracking/fracturing. The presence of hydrocarbons in cemented annuli could be detected even after the cables were exposed to well construction fluids such as synthetic-based drilling mud and spacer fluid. Moreover, the materials used were sensitive to the type of hydrocarbon, allowing indirect hydrocarbon fingerprinting and determination of the origin of the hydrocarbons behind pipe. This presents a powerful new tool to assess the quality of zonal isolation behind casing, with the ability to monitor in real-time over the entire lifecycle of the well. In this capacity, it may provide guidance on such important decisions as the need for well intervention and remedial cementing. "

                    "abstract": "The shift towards drilling more complex and challenging wells is continuing in the oil & gas industry. Designing such complex wells with narrow error margins requires advanced well planning tools that account for transient phenomena such as the influx of gas during drilling operations. However, most of the available drilling hydraulics software packages currently do not account for advanced well control modeling options when deploying new drilling techniques such as Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD). In this paper, we present a novel multi-phase modeling tool that can be deployed in combination with suitable hydraulic models for MPD well control. Its underlying model preserves the transient multi-phase flow behavior of liquid and gas in the well without overly complicating calculation requirements. It is based on coupled conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy in association with appropriate closure relationships. Several numerical schemes have been utilized to optimize the accuracy and computational efficiency of the software. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical user interface has been developed for ease of building the simulation cases. The proposed approach can handle many complexities which occur during a MPD well control incident such as handling multiple influxes from one or several formations, dynamic well control, automated choke control, sudden pump start-up/shut-down, non-Newtonian drilling fluids, arbitrary wellbore path (including directional and horizontal wells), area discontinuity, etc. In addition, this tool can be used to develop and can be used in conjunction with advanced choke control algorithms for MPD. The validity of the software was verified against experimental data from a test well in which a gas kick was induced in a non-Newtonian drilling fluid. The kick was circulated out using the dynamic well control method, which is usually applied during the constant bottom-hole pressure technique of MPD. Parameters such as casing pressure, flow rate in / out of the well, and pit gain were recorded and compared to the simulation results. Excellent agreement was observed between the experimental and simulation results justifying the application of this tool to real-world drilling scenarios. It will be shown that the new tool can accurately estimate parameters such as maximum casing pressure, annular pressure profile, kick tolerance, flow out, pit gain, gas rising velocity, etc. during MPD operations. Applying advanced numerical schemes makes this tool fast, robust, and efficient. As such, it has the potential to improve well control in general and during MPD operations, thereby enhancing rig safety and reducing non-productive time associated with well control-related trouble events.

                    "abstract": "When constructing deepwater wells, incompatibility between synthetic-based mud (SBM) and Portland cements can lead to poor cementation and loss of cement integrity, which in turn may compromise zonal isolation. An alternative cementitious material based on geopolymers has been developed with improved SBM compatibility for primary and remedial cementing purposes as well as lost circulation control. Geopolymer benefits go beyond mere SBM compatibility: it is in fact possible to solidify non-aqueous fluids such as SBM and oil-based mud (OBM) using geopolymer formulations. This also means that non-aqueous fluids (SBM, OBM) can be disposed of in a cost-effective way, which presents a viable option for environmentally acceptable on-site or off-site disposal of drilling muds and cuttings. Geopolymer is a type of alkali activated material that forms when an aluminosilicate precursor powder (such as fly ash) is mixed with an alkaline activating solution (such as sodium hydroxide). A novel SBM solidification method was developed by blending varied amounts of geopolymer and SBM. This solidification method was tested with various sources of precursor powders, SBMs and OBMs. The rheology and strength of the geopolymer/SBM blends were measured under downhole conditions. Strength testing results showed that geopolymer cement lost only 30% of its strength when blended with 10% SBM, while a neat Portland slurry lost 70% strength. Geopolymer/SBM blends containing up to 40% SBM were found to have measurable strength when cured under downhole conditions. By changing the amount of geopolymer and SBM in the slurry, the geopolymer/SBM system can be developed into a lost circulation treatment with low compressive strength, or into a primary cementation material with higher compressive strength. The geopolymer/SBM blends at different mixing ratios have shown great improvement in rheology of the geopolymer cement, allowing for pumpability of the slurry for well cementation. For instance, 30% SBM blends have downhole rheology profiles that approach those of neat Portland slurries. "

                    "abstract": "Drilling through depleted zones in offshore deepwater prospects is becoming more common with ongoing production and field maturation, especially when deeper-lying, virgin-pressured reservoirs are explored and produced in later stages of field development. Some of the challenges associated with these depleted zones include severe mud loss and associated borehole problems, as well as troublesome cementing and poor zonal isolation. Artificially strengthening the wellbore is now becoming of crucial importance in order to successfully drill and cement deepwater wells in mature fields and any other wells with narrow drilling margins. In this paper, we introduce an innovative thermal wellbore strengthening (TWBS) technique to elevate the tangential stress (also known as the hoop stress) near the wellbore, and consequently increase the fracture gradient. A \"thermal fluid,\" consisting of a carrier mud with heat-releasing (\"exothermic\") coated particles, has been designed to target depleted zones and release heat at exactly the right time to increase near-wellbore thermal stress, which directly elevates the near-wellbore tangential stress and in turn elevates the effective fracture gradient. Ultimately, this lowers the risk of lost circulation and improves the chance of successfully cementing and achieving zonal isolation. For instance, a TWBS treatment can be executed as an integral part of the cement job by using it in an extended spacer train for mud displacement, pumped directly prior to cement placement. The coated exothermic particles were designed such that they could release their \"payload\" via an extended time-release mechanism, to ensure that the heat release reaches the appropriate target location in the wellbore at the right time. The chemical systems, which are based on dissolving various hygroscopic salts in water, were tested and developed to heat up the wellbore and increase temperature up to 100°C. This will potentially elevate the fracture gradient by several hundred psi, depending on formation properties. Details regarding the formulation and testing of the non-coated, coated particles, and the carrier fluid are discussed; as well as considerations for TWBS field application. In addition, a new computational heat transfer model was developed to calculate the temperature distribution within the rock formation and within the drillstring/work string and wellbore annulus, for a formation contacted by a fluid with particles that react in exothermic fashion. The new model calculates the transient temperature distribution, increase in near-wellbore stress, and fracture gradient for a given amount of heat generation by the fluid and temperature increase in the rock. It can assist with well design aspects of the proposed thermal wellbore strengthening technique, and is particularly helpful in estimating the downhole temperature variations and assessing its implications prior to job execution. Details of the model and results of several typical simulations are given herein. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate measurement of drilling fluid rheological properties is essential in order to optimize wellbore construction, and in particular to properly manage hydraulics. It becomes even more crucial during deepwater drilling when a \"narrow mud window\" is present which may require the use of more advanced drilling technologies such as Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD). Operating these technologies properly requires the use of sophisticated hydraulic models that require accurate rheological information as input. However, a full mud check with determination of all relevant rheological parameters is usually only carried out once a day, and augmented with one or two partial checks in the 24h period. The results are also highly dependent on the mud engineer carrying out the tests. Such intermittent and unreliable measurements are unfortunately not sufficient to provide the required inputs for \"real-time\" hydraulic modeling and control. A more practical approach for a continuous, automated monitoring of the drilling fluid properties is therefore called for. In this paper, we introduce a practical automated approach with minimum maintenance efforts to continuously monitor the drilling fluid rheological parameters at the rig site. The method is based on the pipe viscometer approach rather than the traditional rotational viscometer method. Additional inputs for hydraulic models, such as mud density, transition to turbulent flow (critical Reynolds number), and real-time friction factor for non-Newtonian drilling and completion fluids can also be obtained using a pipe viscometer. A prototype of this equipment was constructed, tested, and fully automated in the lab. It was tested with several weighted and unweighted mud systems. During the measurement process, the driving pump was ramped up and held intermittently at various flow rates to measure the laminar frictional pressure loss in the pipe section. The data thus obtained was analyzed by software that generated a flow curve and from it derived relevant mud rheological parameters using a suitable rheological model. It also proved possible to extend the test to the turbulent flow regime and obtain the \"true\" friction factor in real-time for each particular fluid, rather than relying on a limited number of correlations that quite often exhibit inaccurate results, particularly for the Yield Power Law (YPL) fluids. Several successful tests with different mud systems indicate the reliability and robustness of the proposed technique. We believe that this approach is a major step towards achieving an effective fully automated system for mud rheology measurement, mud maintenance, and real-time management of ECD without any direct human interaction. The simple equipment set up and its fully automated measurement and data analysis processes make it highly suitable for field application. The days when mud engineers were laboriously working rotational viscometers are coming to an end, and the \"one-click automated mud check\" is becoming a reality. "

                    "abstract": "The cement annulus between a wellbore and a casing string should provide reliable zonal isolation throughout the life of a well. However, zonal isolation may be negatively affected by several factors which can compromise cement integrity and lead to the development of channels that provide migration paths for hydrocarbons. This paper is dedicated to monitoring the unwanted presence and migration of hydrocarbons in cemented annuli using a sophisticated fiber optic sensing system. The system is comprised of a distributed temperature and strain sensing (DTSS) data acquisition unit and a newly designed fiber optic cable that is capable of detecting hydrocarbons in cemented annuli. The DTSS system is based on Brillouin and Rayleigh backscattering mechanisms, which are sensitive to both strain and temperature changes. The cable consists of a single-mode optical fiber packaged with a hydrocarbon-sensitive polymer. This combination was tested extensively and successfully for its ability to identify cement integrity issues through detection of hydrocarbons in the cement. The presence of hydrocarbons causes the polymer around the fiber to swell, leading to changes in strain distribution on the fiber. These strain variations were detected using the DTSS monitoring system. The observed strain variations were found to be dependent on the type of fluids, which indicates that the proposed system has selective sensitivity to certain hydrocarbons. For example, synthetic-based mud had little effect on strain, while kerosene showed a significant response. In conclusion, the new fiber optic sensing system can be beneficial in verifying zonal isolation by detecting and monitoring any unwanted hydrocarbon migration in cemented annuli, identifying zones from which hydrocarbons are originating, and providing other essential information to identify the need for well intervention such as remedial cementing.

When the top drive fails, drilling halts and operations are suspended until the machine is fixed, at considerable cost to all parties. Literature and survey data reveal that top drive failure is among the leading causes of hardware-related non-productive time (NPT) on drilling rigs. The objective therefore is to detect a failing top drive hours or even days before it can no longer function effectively, and pro-actively maintain it before catastrophic failure takes places. In this paper, three separate health monitoring techniques are considered for a top drive: thermal analysis, vibration analysis, and oil analysis. Appropriate sensors are suggested for each of the three analyses, and are described in this paper. The paper also details a thermal model and a fault detection algorithm used to monitor the lubrication and electric motor subsystems of an AC electric top drive. These algorithms have been implemented and deployed in the field. Since no faults have occurred to date in the top drives on which these algorithms have been deployed, simulation results are presented for artificially induced faults. The advantages and disadvantages of other relevant sensor technologies and methodologies are studied and discussed. It is shown that the upfront cost of the sensors and the data acquisition system can easily be recouped by preventing one to two top drive failures. Additionally, the thermal analysis method described can be conducted with the existing sensor suite available on most top drives. This novel methodology can be easily implemented without the need for complex sensors, and is expected to make a meaningful, positive contribution to lowering NPT associated with rig hardware failures.

Our primary aim was to determine the PSD which maximizes the Wellbore Strengthening (WBS) benefits obtained from fracture sealing. High-pressure borehole fracturing experiments were conducted on Berea sandstone samples under atmospheric pore pressure and various confining pressures to investigate the WBS effects of several LCM blends. Post-fracturing methods such as Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT) scan and thin-section imaging were used to investigate the geometry of induced fractures and formed seals within them. Based on the conducted experiments and post-fracturing analyses, we have evaluated and re-assessed well-known theories applicable to the design of LCM blends, such as the one-third rule, the ideal packing theory, and the Vickers criteria. Our experiments indicate that for any rock with a given set of rock strength and failure parameters, there exists an optimum PSD to maximize WBS benefits. Optimum PSD appears to be of primary importance, almost independent of LCM type. In addition, we have shown that the optimum PSD should have a bimodal structure, with sufficient concentrations of properly sized fine and coarse particles. Although the one-third rule, the ideal packing theory, and the Vickers criteria may provide some basic PSD guidelines, these theories are mainly empirical relationships based on conventional particle plugging experiments. As shown here, they do not properly represent the physics of fracture sealing. To remedy this situation, we are introducing a new family of design curves for optimum PSD, based on the underlying physics of fracture sealing observed in the WBS experiments. "

Several injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to measure the Fracture Initiation Pressure (FIP) and the stable Fracture Propagation Pressure (FPP) at various confining pressures. The measured FIPs were compared – and found to be in good agreement – with Rummel's model for FIP. The stable FPPs were measured using base SBM and SBM with Lost Circulation Material (LCM), and compared with the large-scale fracturing experiments conducted at the Drilling Engineering Association (DEA) 13 investigation. Our study shows that the stable FPP changes linearly with the minimum horizontal stress (Sh), and does not depend on the maximum horizontal stress (SH). In addition, for borehole diameter equal to or greater than 0.5 inch, the stable FPP is not affected by the borehole size. We propose an experimental approach to predict the stable FPP for arbitrary in-situ stresses, borehole size, and fluid formulation. Introduction Drilling Induced Fractures (DIF) grow as the borehole pressure exceeds the fracture pressure. In an intact rock, the DIF growth occurs in two phases: fracture initiation and fracture propagation (Morita et al., 1996). Fracture initiation occurs when the borehole pressure exceeds the FIP and results in formation of small DIFs near the borehole. Fracture propagation occurs when the borehole pressure is maintained above the FPP. During the fracture propagation phase, the formed DIF grows significantly in size (van Oort and Vargo, 2008). Enlargement of the DIFs result in formation of large fracture networks, which can create lost circulation problems. Lost circulation – the uncontrolled flow of drilling fluid into the geological formation – results in significant loss of drilling fluid. Severe lost circulation problems can complicate well delivery and increase the non-productive time. In extreme cases, they may lead to losing the well or necessitate drilling costly sidetracks (see e.g., Gradishar et al., 2013). "

Wettability is intimately tied to the zeta potential, which is determined by the electrostatic forces among the rock's mineral constituents. Extensive prior research has been conducted into the relationship between wettability and surface forces of shale samples that have been ground up and/or otherwise been altered. However, very little attention has been given to measuring the zeta potential of the surface of unbroken, intact shale samples. A new technique is explored in this paper that investigates the zeta potential of the actual surface of shale samples in one intact piece. The surface zeta potential of shales was found to be strongly determined by the mineral composition and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the shale. Shales containing higher amounts of silicates (e.g. quartz, feldspar, and clays such as Illite and Smectite) tended to be water-wet and exhibit higher negative zeta potential values. Shales that contained higher amounts of carbonates (dolomite, aragonite, calcite, etc.) were more oil-wet with zeta potential values that were less negative or slightly positive. Measurements were also performed on Berea and Boise sandstone in order to compare organic vs. inorganic samples. Results for common shales showed Mancos and Marcellus to be intermediate-wet, Oxford and Eagleford to be moderately oil-wet, and Arne to be highly water-wet. Additionally, the zeta potential was also studied in various ionic and nano-particle solutions. "

Given its effectiveness to help drill today's challenging wells economically, WBS has become a routine part of the drilling fluid design and the well construction process in general. However, the drilling industry still lacks a general model to optimally exploit WBS for various formation types and fluid systems. In this paper, we have conducted a systematic investigation of the major parameters which affect WBS treatment in permeable formations. Large-scale fracturing experiments were conducted on two rock types with significantly different permeability and stiffness: Berea sandstone (stiff - moderately permeable) and Castlegate sandstone (weak - highly permeable). Several fluid injection cycles were carried out on each rock sample to characterize the Fracture Initiation Pressure (FIP) and Fracture Propagation Pressure (FPP). Further, we investigated the effect of Lost Circulation Material (LCM) - which are used for WBS purposes - on the FIP and the FPP. Also, we studied the effects of the concentration and the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) of LCM blends, the confining pressure, the stiffness and the permeability of rock samples. The experimental results confirmed that the FIP is mainly a function of rock tensile strength and stress concentration around the borehole, and not affected by the presence of LCM. The FPP, however, can be significantly enhanced by adding LCM to drilling fluids. Further, FPP enhancement is largely independent of the rock stiffness. We also found that a minimum concentration of LCM is necessary for effective WBS. However, no significant additional enhancement in the strengthening benefits was observed for concentrations above a certain upper threshold. In addition, our results showed that a higher LCM concentration is required for effective WBS in formations with a lower permeability (i.e. tighter formations). PSD dominates the strengthening benefits of an LCM blend and, for both tested rock types, LCM blends with a broad bimodal PSD provide superior strengthening benefits compared to those with a unimodal PSD. In this paper, we introduce design guidelines to maximize the attainable strengthening benefits of LCM blends. The findings of this paper are relevant to improve the construction of (ultra-) deep-water wells with a narrow drilling margin through systematic optimization of WBS treatments and minimization of non-productive time.

This model is capable of representing essential dynamics during a gas kick with reduced computational overhead, but without sacrificing significant modeling accuracy. First, the model is validated in a gas kick scenario against experimental data, showing good agreement between key measured parameters and the model predictions, and thereby justifying the model applicability to field operations. Next, data generated from a commercial simulator test case is used to evaluate the proposed estimation methodology. The estimated pore pressure and reservoir productivity are close to their respective values from the commercial simulator, and the flow out rate and surface back-pressure predicted by the simplified two-phase model yield very good match against the simulator results.

The industry currently lacks a readily usable real-time tortuosity (density) index to enable the driller to make corrections during the drilling process. This paper presents a new algorithm to calculate the tortuosity index and validates the index using field data. Until the last decade, average and maximum dogleg severity were the main indicators of wellbore tortuosity and quality. Recently, approaches which measure/model indirect quantities such as wellbore friction, bending moment, elastic energy etc. and then translate these to a measure of tortuosity, have gained popularity. However, such an indirect process introduces errors when the model used is not accurate. Another approach produces high precision 3D wellbore profiles to assist in ascertaining the tortuosity of the well. This method, however, requires additional downhole sensors at additional cost and a need for additional data-communicating and processing. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a methodology that is leveraging techniques used in medical field, more specifically in ophthalmology, to determine the tortuosity of the narrow veins in human eyes. The methodology described in this paper produces a tortuosity \"density\" that has the ability to capture tortuosity at different length scales (from 1 foot to 10,000 feet). It works with conventional directional survey data and/or high-resolution survey as input and calculates a normalized number, the tortuosity (density) index, in real-time. The methodology was applied on the horizontal sections of 18 wells drilled in 2013 and 2014, and the tortuosity indices derived for these wells were compared against reports of drilling dysfunction and non-productive time. The tortuosity index correctly identified problematic wells that had multiple downhole equipment failures during drilling, and showed a strong correlation with other drilling dysfunctions. The new real-time index provides a holistic view of wellbore tortuosity and may help to mitigate and correct problems before they occur. No new sensors or special practices are needed for the adoption of the method. This index is also robust to changes in survey distance, and provides an indication of micro-tortuosity when continuous/high-frequency gyro data is available. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) plays a vital role in hydraulic preplanning and real-time management of drilling operations. Such accuracy is often not available in case of drilling horizontal and extended reach wells, when there is a partially or fully eccentric annulus in a large section of the wellbore. Many hydraulic models, including those widely used in the industry based on e.g. the Narrow Slot approximation, simply ignore the effects of drillpipe eccentricity on annular pressure loss and equivalent circulating density (ECD), thereby generating unreliable estimates for these important quantities. In this study, we discuss the experimental, analytical, and numerical results of a comprehensive investigation into the impact of drillpipe eccentricity on ECD in horizontal and extended reach wells while circulating non-Newtonian drilling fluids. A 91 ft. long flow loop with a drillpipe to hole/casing ratio of 0.5 (fairly common in conventional drilling applications) was used for the experimental investigation. Drillpipe was placed at the bottom of the hole/casing, thereby simulating a fully eccentric annulus. Four non-Newtonian drilling fluids, which their rheological behavior best described by the Yield Power Law (YPL) model, were used as test fluids. Moreover, a novel numerical model based on a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach was developed. Subsequently, the experimental data was compared with both the new proposed model as well as with several other widely used analytical and numerical models previously reported in the literature. Field data analysis was also conducted to investigate the impact of eccentricity on ECD in a deviated well. The experimental results confirm and add to the historical observations that the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus is significantly less than the values predicted by the Narrow Slot approach, sometimes by more than 50%. In general, all the evaluated models underestimated the effect of drillpipe eccentricity on annular frictional pressure loss. However, by comparison, the newly proposed model in this study exhibited by far the least discrepancy with the experimental results. The difference between the estimated and experimental results was found to be proportional to the magnitude of the fluid yield stress and consistency index, and attributed to the complexity associated with simulating YPL fluids. This study provides valuable insight towards superior hydraulic planning and real-time ECD management in horizontal and extended-reach wells. Its beneficial impact on managing the annular pressure between the fracture and pore pressure in the field to prevent drilling problems such as kicks, mud loss and wellbore instability events is expected to be immediate. Its use will also be key to successful implementation of innovative drilling techniques such as managed pressure drilling and dual gradient drilling, which require highly accurate annular pressure prediction and management.

                    "abstract": "The drilling industry has begun to cherish the value of data collected from downhole sensors, often gathered at high frequencies. Moreover, it has started to capitalize on the availability, analyses and credibility of this data through step-changing knowledge gains that have enabled meaningful drilling performance improvements. As a result, topics like data quality, data ownership, and data integration are now routinely being discussed among stakeholders as data from downhole memory tools slowly starts to integrate into routine well planning and optimization workflows. The collectors of data usually are not the sole owners and main beneficiaries of such data. Large amounts of data have to be transferred from service providers to various collaborators within and across companies. The process of agreeing on a data format, relevant accessory information and means of transfer, is currently laboriously repeated on a project-by-project basis. This practice not only consumes unnecessarily resources on both ends, but also carries the risk of losing crucial contextual information. WITSML standards are often unsuitable for large high frequency data files and do not provide enough flexibility for certain contextual information. This work proposes a file format suitable for securely storing downhole data and sharing it across all stakeholders, providing both flexibility and simplicity. The proposed file format implements a set of specialized horizontal and vertical dividers to structure contextual information on the well, the run, and the sensors, and to store them in the same file as the measurements. Among other things, well and section information, responsible personnel, equipment and sensor properties, time calibration, and operational parameters may be specified. The inclusion of both required and optional inputs ensures both flexibility and essential context, and allows the coverage of a variety of applications. It is comparable to the Log ACSII Standard (LAS) file that quickly found wide acceptance in the well logging community and beyond after its introduction in 1990. The implemented dividers enable the data files to be easily accessed by variety of programs and comfortably viewed by the human eye using any standard spreadsheet or text file application. Importing and exporting applications can be provided to the users, who can then easily produce these files from raw data for transfer, or integrate them into existing data management systems. Stakeholders, such as operators, service companies, and tool manufacturers are involved with the creation of this standard file format to ensure consent amongst all users. The standardization of downhole sensor data files proposed in this work marks an important step towards automated analysis of downhole data, reduction of data loads, and data integration. Our approach is illustrated using various examples of how the new standard can be applied on actual field data. "

Novel measurement tools and techniques are now making it possible to carry out sophisticated drilling fluid analyses using largely automated equipment. This paper anticipates and highlights the important role that automated particle size analyzers will play in future drilling operations. A comprehensive experimental study was carried out using a new generation of particle size analyzers (PSA) to investigate their utility for automated drilling fluid analysis. The pieces of equipment that were evaluated were the Canty Microflow LPA (which uses imaging microscopy), the Mettler Toledo G400 ParticleTrack (which uses FBRM laser diffraction) and the Malvern Mastersizer and Zetasizer (which use Dynamic Light Scattering). These instruments were used in conjunction with in-house flow loops and shearing facilities to test (1) degradation of the particle size distribution (PSD) of lost circulation and wellbore strengthening materials under the influence of shear, (2) the behavior of the emulsion droplet size distribution (DSD) of invert emulsion mud systems (oil-based and synthetic-based muds). Verifying and maintaining the PSD of lost circulation/wellbore strengthening materials is of crucial importance to prevent severe mud loss events that still continue to plague the industry at a trouble cost of many billions of dollars per annum. Our PSA analyses show that the PSD's of such materials, particularly those of medium to coarser sizes, is far from stable and degrades over time, primarily due to the influence of shear. It will be shown that automated, in-line PSA equipment allows for the degradation to be monitored and managed in real-time to maintain optimum drilling performance. In addition, such equipment can be used to monitor and optimize the DSD of an invert system, which is an extremely important quantity that influences many mud performance characteristics such as rheology, emulsion stability, fluid loss behavior, osmotic membrane efficiency, etc. The work involves a comparative study of novel PSA's, ranking them by accuracy, ease of use, automation potential, real-time monitoring capability etc. It presents novel, non-intuitive data on the degradation of lost circulation/wellbore strengthening materials, thereby allowing ways to manage this degradation. It also presents, for the first time, some preliminary work on the behavior of invert mud droplet size and its impact on oil-/synthetic-based mud performance. "

                    "abstract": "Real-time estimation of the annular pressure profile is crucial for the planning and execution of well control operations, particularly while drilling wells in formations having narrow mud windows. Currently, the industry employs either simplified heuristic techniques, or complicated and often cost prohibitive commercial simulators, which are essentially \"black boxes\" with no options for further change by the user. Neither of the two approaches is particularly suitable for precise real-time well control analysis or design of robust automatic well control algorithms. Therefore, a simple transient multi-phase simulator amenable to real-time applications, which can represent essential dynamics with minimal cost and computational requirements, is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a novel reduced Drift-Flux approach to model multi-phase well control situations. The model still preserves the transient multi-phase behavior of liquids and gas in the well. The proposed formulation consists of a lumped parameter model of the pressure dynamics, a transport equation for gas bubble migration, and the associated closure relations. Together, they form a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations with limited complexity. We then employ an explicit numerical solution algorithm that is fast and thereby reduces computational time and cost, making it suitable for control purposes. The validity of the model is tested against experimental data from a test well with a simulated gas kick event. The model is also compared against a well control scenario generated by a commercial multi-phase flow simulator extensively used in the industry. There is good agreement between the results of the proposed model and the experimental data, on the one hand, and the commercial simulator results, on the other, thereby justifying the applicability of this model to real-world scenarios. The model provides a powerful tool to estimate and manage the surface pressures during a well control event for a given kick size and intensity. It has evident applications in well control analysis, automated Managed Pressure Drilling and well control management. As such, it has the potential to improve well control risk mitigation, enhance rig safety, and reduce non-productive time associated with well control-related trouble events. "

                    "abstract": "Early kick detection and blowout prevention is a major concern in any drilling operation. Usually, conventional well control procedures rely merely on the pit gain and variations in pump pressure as the primary indicators to detect and handle a kick. These indicators are rudimentary and unreliable for drilling costly offshore wells while advanced well control techniques demand more reliable indicators for early detection of kicks. For instance, early kick detection plays a vital role in deploying Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques successfully. Moreover, in conventional drilling, the only widely accepted response to a gas influx is to shut the well in on the BOPs. The Constant Bottom Hole Pressure (CBHP) variation of MPD allows for circulating small and medium-sized influxes out without the need to shut in the well, either by increasing casing backpressure and/or by adjusting pump flow rate. Evident benefits include a faster response to the kick (with clear safety benefits) and a considerable time and cost savings compared to the conventional approach. Unfortunately, there is currently no method available to decide upon the best MPD-CBHP response during an influx, because such a response depends on many parameters, such as Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure (MASP), wellbore geometry, fracture pressure of any weak zones exposed in open hole, type of drilling fluid, influx size, etc. To remedy this situation, we present a fast and accurate decision-making method that overcomes the traditional difficulties and automatically selects a best well control response. The method incorporates a transient multi-phase model based on mass and momentum conservation. A numerical simulator was developed for this purpose. Comparing the actual well response with simulated results during an influx event and following the proposed algorithm allows the best response to be taken in a quick, convenient, and accurate manner. Moreover, the approach lends itself well to fully automated well control. Here, we describe the new method and its validation using available two-phase experimental data for annular air–water and air-mud flow for a wide range of flow rates and flow regimes. We believe that the method provides a powerful new decision-making and design tool in MPD operations that ensures delivery of safer wells with lower non-productive time and associated trouble cost spent on well control operations.

                    "abstract": "Wellbore strengthening (WBS) offers enabling technology for wells that are drilled in geological environments with a narrow drilling margin. Through its deployment, costly lost circulation events may be avoided, casing setting depths may be extended, and, in optimum cases, deeper targets may be reached with a reduced or slimmed-down casing program. The elevation of the fracture gradient offered by WBS is a complex issue that involves the growth of fractures in permeable or impermeable rocks using non-Newtonian drilling fluids that are laden with solids of varying types and sizes. Several plausible (and sometimes contradictory) models have been proposed historically to explain the WBS phenomenon, and the only way to assess the correct explanation is through dedicated experimentation. In this paper, an experimental technique to study WBS under realistic conditions is introduced, and the results of a series of larger-scale fracturing experiments using this technique are presented. The experimental set-up described here consists of a dual flow-loop/ pressure-intensifying system to carry out high-pressure borehole fracturing tests on cylindrical rock samples while maintaining continuous circulation of the drilling fluid within the borehole. The system offers full control over pore pressure, radial confining pressure and, if desired, independent axial pressure. Several injection cycles are performed to characterize the values of the fracture initiation pressure (FIP) and fracture propagation pressure (FPP) and thereby characterize WBS effects. Typical experimental variables included: the type of base fluid (water-based, oil- or synthetic-based), the concentration, type, and particle size distribution (PSD) of lost circulation materials (LCMs) used to achieve WBS effects, and the type of rock tested (sandstone and shale, i.e. permeable and impermeable rock media). Additionally, post-fracturing techniques such as thin-section analysis were employed to study the fracture geometry and deposition structure of plugging solids on the fracture surfaces. The experiments clearly show that for any rock with a given set of rock strength and failure parameters, there is an optimum PSD for maximizing WBS effects. Optimum PSD appears to be of primary importance, almost irrespective of LCM type. The results furthermore show that although a minimum concentration of LCM bridging agents is required for effective WBS, FPP does not increase significantly for concentrations above a certain upper threshold value. Moreover, increasing the injection volume during WBS squeeze treatments above a threshold value may actually lead to lower FPP values. All of these findings have important implications for field application of WBS treatments. In addition, petrographic imaging of the fracture after testing show that fracture plugging occurs in the proximity of the fracture tip and not close to wellbore face, in direct support of the Fracture Propagation Resistance (FPR) model of WBS, and in disagreement with Wellbore Stress Augmentation/ Stress Cage models. The results not only confirm information from previous investigations, but also provide new insight into effective ways to strengthen wellbores in various formations. The experimental results are directly applicable to improve well construction and to minimize non-productive time on narrow drilling-margin wells such as (ultra-) deep-water wells by selecting the appropriate mud formulations, LCM materials and their concentrations, as well as application treatments.

                    "abstract": "Downhole high frequency sensors are heralding the era of big data in drilling and have already shown potential to significantly push the limits of drilling performance. Downhole data transmitted in real time can be used to optimally select parameters during drilling and optimize off-bottom operations. The wealth of information from retrieved memory data gives immediate insights in well specific performance limiters. Nevertheless, downhole data is not yet used to its full potential, as the industry is only just beginning to make sense out of the many gigabytes of recorded data. Often, measurements cannot be unambiguously linked to specific downhole dynamics and their respective dysfunction. Most valuable information is lost directly at the sensor when processing (e.g. averaging) is not done appropriately. In other cases, huge amounts of high frequency data are transmitted and stored without providing much useful information. Large data volumes quickly reach the limits of transmission broadband and memory capacities of downhole tools and pose huge challenges to drilling data analysis and data integration. As a solution to handling the rapidly increasing amounts of drilling data, this paper proposes a value of information based approach to downhole sensors, data processing and analysis. An extensive set of field data from multiple operations is used to demonstrate the interrelation of dynamic effects and their impact on downhole sensor measurements. Different requirements on sensor type and collection frequency apply to identify different types of drilling performance limiting dysfunction, such as vibrations, well tortuosity or cutting accumulations due to poor hole cleaning. It is shown that the analysis of frequencies is key to separate multiple downhole effects wrapped into one measurement. For each prominent type of dysfunction, minimum data collection frequencies are specified which allows for the differentiation of unimportant noise from valuable drilling performance limiters. These insights are used to describe more effective methods of data processing, by cross-linking information from multiple sensors. "

                    "abstract": "In recent years, the drilling industry has been exploring the use of sophisticated downhole sensors and more elaborate surface sensors to improve prediction and detection of trouble events such as kicks, fracture breathing and lost circulation. The use of such sensors, however, comes at a considerable additional cost and is often difficult to justify on low-cost land-based wells. On the other hand, the conventional suite of low-cost surface sensors often drift out of calibration and, without manual intervention, can provide bad data that may lead to missed or false alarms. It would be highly desirable if the conventional sensors could still be used but with improved robustness and precision for event detection. This paper reviews existing event detection methods and their shortcomings, and proposes a new method that not only addresses these shortcomings, but also improves the quality of the sensor data gathered. This paper presents a pattern-recognition system that allows for fast analysis of sensor patterns to identify events, and a real-time sensor calibration methodology that uses a combination of a physics- based model and machine-learning techniques to improve the quality and usability of rig sensor data. Focus is on gains/kick events in particular. The calibration algorithm analyzes the quality of sensors in a mud circulation system and calibrates these sensors to yield meaningful data. This leads to a much higher accuracy in the sensed data, e.g. by mitigating flow sensor drift. The presented event detection system can then more reliably detect a kick, lost circulation or a fracture breathing event with reduced frequency of false/missed alarms. The proposed method has been tested and implemented on actual mud circulation sensor data from the field. Using the analyzed data we demonstrate how real-time calibration can high-grade the data from a simple flow paddle sensor into much more accurate flow rate readings. We also show how sensor calibration allows for increased confidence in the values of other sensors as well, such as the pump stroke counter readings. Ultimately, the method presented in this paper allows one to extract more meaningful information from inexpensive surface sensors and make drilling trouble event predictions that are much more accurate than currently available industry methods.

                    "abstract": "It is common practice when drilling oil and gas wells to assume that the drillstring is placed concentrically in the annular space with either the open hole or previous casing strings in order to predict annular frictional pressure losses. The assumption of such a concentric annulus is, however, a considerable simplification that may not properly reflect the majority of drilling applications in the field. In fact, with an increasing number of deviated/horizontal and extended reach wells being drilled, a fully eccentric annulus is actually present in a large section of the wellbore. In this study, we apply experimental, analytical, and numerical approaches to investigate the impact of drillpipe eccentricity on the annular pressure loss while circulating non-Newtonian drilling fluids. The length of the experimental section of a flow loop was 27.74 m (91′) and it consisted of 0.0245 m (1″) steel drillpipe and 0.0571 m (2.25″) acrylic casing with the inner diameter of 0.0508 m (2″). Drillpipe was placed at the bottom of the casing, thereby simulating a fully eccentric annulus. Four Yield Power Law (YPL) drilling fluids were tested in this flow loop. Annular pressure loss for a wide range of laminar flow rates was recorded for each fluid. A numerical model based on a finite difference approach was developed to estimate the annular pressure loss. Subsequently, the experimental data was compared with the proposed model and also with several other widely used analytical and numerical approaches previously reported in the literature. The obtained results show that in the laminar flow regime, the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus is considerably less than a concentric annulus, on occasions by less than 50%. In general, all the applied models under-estimated the effect of eccentricity on pressure loss. However, the novel proposed model showed the least discrepancy with the experimental data. Furthermore, it was found that the difference between the estimated and experimental results increases with increasing fluid yield stress. This suggests that models and/or correlations that are developed to correct for the eccentricity effect for fluids with negligible yield stress (for instance Power Law fluids) are not suitable to estimate the pressure loss for YPL fluids with elevated yield stress.

                    "abstract": "One the most important tasks during any drilling operation is to measure rheological properties of drilling fluids to allow for optimum maintenance and wellbore hydraulics management. In current drilling practice, such measurement is routinely carried out by a mud engineer at the rig site using test protocols and equipment that quantify the relationship between the fluid's shear stress and shear rate, as standardized by the American Petroleum Institute (API). Usually, measurements are conducted at atmospheric pressure and standardized temperature and are therefore generally not representative of actual downhole pressure and temperature conditions. High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) viscometers can of course be used at the drilling fluid design stage to determine its rheological properties under downhole condition. However, these properties are subjected to change during drilling operations due to variation in mud maintenance and the introduction of drilling solids and contaminations. In addition, installation of a HPHT viscometer at the rig site is highly impractical due to its cost, maintenance, calibration difficulties, and lack of dedicated personnel to run the equipment. This paper presents a novel method to determine mud rheological parameters in real-time by using downhole sensor data. The well itself is used as the equivalent of a large pipe viscometer, with pressure measurements conducted along its length using multiple sensors placed at strategic positions in the drillstring. Contrary to traditional methods, rheology determination is performed at actual downhole pressure and temperature, without any human interaction and without the need for any rheology measurement equipment on surface. Frictional pressure loss is recorded at several flow rates, preferably while ramping up pump rates after making connections, and parameters associated with two- and three-parameter rheological models (e.g. the n, K and τy parameters of the Yield Power Law (YPL) also known as Herschel-Bulkley model, which most accurately describes the majority of drilling fluids) are derived. In addition, time-dependent fluid characteristics such as gel strength can also be quantified using this method. Pressure data sets from wired drillpipe during field trials with a 12.6 ppg and 13.1 ppg synthetic based muds were used to validate the applicability of the new method in the field. These validations show that the method can be applied successfully in the field when downhole distributed pressure data is available. This novel approach represents a significant step in the direction of achieving full automation of drilling fluid property monitoring and maintenance with an elegant method that requires no human interaction, eliminating the need for surface measurement equipment, while at the same time representing more accurately the downhole pressure and temperature environment. Given the importance of accurate rheology characterization, particularly in the new era of active annular pressure management using Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) and Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD) techniques that rely heavily on accurate hydraulics modeling, the benefits are self-evident.

                    "abstract": "The incompatibility of cement and shale and the subsequent failure of primary cementing jobs is a very significant concern in the oil & gas industry. On wells ranging from hydraulically fractured shale land wells to deepwater wells, this incompatibility leads to an increased risk in failing to isolate zones, which could possibly present a well control hazard and can lead to sustained casing pressure. The cement-shale interface presents a weak link that often becomes compromised by the loads incurred either during drilling, completion/stimulation or production phases. To formulate cements for effective zonal isolation, it is crucial to evaluate the bond strength of the cement-shale interface. Although several studies have focused on the interactions between cement and sandstone, very few studies have addressed the bonding behavior of cement with shale. The conventional push-out test protocol used to measure cement-to-sandstone shear bond strength has proven to be difficult to apply to shale due to its laminated and/or brittle nature that complicates sample preparation and can lead to shale or cement matrix failure instead of failure at the interface. In this paper, we present a novel, simple and versatile laboratory test procedure to measure the shear bond strength between cement and shale. The new procedure was used to develop cement formulations to improve the cement-to-shale bond. Various types of surfactants were added to cement slurry to evaluate their effects on cement bonding property. Our results indicate that bond strength of cement with shale can be enhanced by incorporating particular surfactants in cement slurries. "

                    "abstract": "Competent cementing to achieve lasting zonal isolation is a crucial requirement during well construction. Key to achieving a good cementation is proper displacement of drilling fluid out of annular spaces and placement of the cement in them. The viscosity contrast between drilling fluid, spacer(s) and cement as well as centralization of the casing in the wellbore are important variables affecting displacement efficiency. For instance, when the casing is not well-centralized in the wellbore, fluids flow more easily and faster through the wider annular gap, while displacement lags behind and may be incomplete in the narrower gap. Such non-uniform displacement and/or incomplete cement placement can lead to unreliable zonal isolation, which in turn may compromise the productive life of the well. In this paper, a new cementing technique is presented wherein the rheological properties and the flow direction of the cement slurry can be controlled in real-time to achieve more uniform displacements, even when casing is not optimally centralized. This new technique is based on the principles of magneto-rheology, where an external magnetic field is applied to a cement slurry carrying magnetic particles. In the presence of the magnetic field, the viscoelastic properties of such a modified slurry change instantaneously to cause a stiffening behavior characterized by yield point values that are increased by several orders of magnitude. By varying the intensity and the direction of the magnetic field as well as the dosage of magnetic particles, the flow properties of the slurry can be altered and the flow can be beneficially directed as desired. The magneto-rheological behavior presents other benefits as well. The instantaneous stiffening effect when a magnetic field is switched on can be exploited to generate temporary top-, bottom- or straddle packers for pressure control, and the specific sensitivity of the magnetic slurry to an external field may be exploited for sensing the quality and integrity of cement sheath over the life of the well. Voids, gaps or cracks in the cemented annulus cause disturbances of magnetic field lines that may be picked up by suitable detectors. "

                    "abstract": "Measuring rheological properties of drilling fluids for optimum maintenance and wellbore hydraulic management is one the most important tasks during any drilling operation. In current drilling practice, such measurement is carried out by a mud engineer at the rig site using test protocols and equipment that quantify the relationship between the fluid's shear stress and shear rate, as standardized by API. Usually, measurements are conducted at atmospheric pressure and standardized temperature. Therefore, these rheological properties are generally not representative of the actual downhole pressure and temperature conditions, particularly not when it comes to deeper and more complex wells. This paper presents a novel method to determine mud rheological parameters in real-time by using downhole sensor data. The well itself is used as the equivalent of a large pipe viscometer, with pressure measurements conducted along its length using sensors placed at strategic positions in the drillstring. Contrary to traditional methods, rheology determination is performed automatically at downhole pressure and temperature, without any human interaction and without the need for any rheology measurement equipment on surface. Frictional pressure loss is recorded at several flow rates, preferably while ramping up pump rates after making connections, and parameters associated with two- and three-parameter rheological models (e.g. the n, K and to parameters of the Yield Power Law (YPL) also known as Herschel-Bulkley model, which most accurately describes the majority of drilling fluids) are derived. In addition, time-dependent fluid characteristics such as gel strength can also be quantified using this method. Pressure data from wired (intelligent) drillpipe during field trials with a 12.6 ppg synthetic based mud was used to clearly validate the applicability of the new method in the field. Comparison of surface and downhole rheological parameters yielded excellent agreement, showing that the method can be applied successfully in the field when downhole pressure measurement techniques are available. This novel approach represents a significant step in the direction of achieving full automation of drilling fluid property monitoring and maintenance with an elegant method that requires no human interaction, eliminating the need for surface measurement equipment, while representing more accurately the downhole pressure and temperature environment. Given the importance of accurate rheology characterization, particularly in the new era of active annular pressure management using managed pressure drilling (MPD) and dual gradient drilling (DGD) techniques that rely heavily on accurate hydraulics modeling, the benefits are self-evident.

                    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in automated drilling in the recent decade, motivated primarily by increased well construction efficiency, enhanced safety and well quality requirements. Many drilling tasks have been successfully automated and pilot technologies have been deployed, but broader adoption has remained slow. This can be attributed to some key factors. First, no two wells or rigs are the same. So the concept of \"developing one algorithm applicable to all scenarios\" is difficult except in the simplest of cases where only a limited set of tightly integrated sensors and actuators are involved. Secondly, full automation requires cohesive data and information integration between multiple stakeholders: the operator, the service provider, the drilling contractor and the equipment manufacturer. No efficient mathematical construct has been adopted for integrating data / information from these different stakeholders. Thirdly, any drilling automation task requires the full buy-in of the drilling crew, which is often difficult when these algorithms are presented as black-box solutions and it is unclear how to bring the rig to a safe condition when automation fails. A mathematical construct, and the methodology / architecture is presented that would enable one to combine information and data from multiple sources in a meaningful way and the rapid development of intuitive control algorithms that can be easily understood without advanced degrees or training is demonstrated. The algorithm development process is purposefully simplified, allowing for well engineers to easily develop their own control strategies while enabling rig- and site-specific customization. Additionally, the visual nature of the methodology enables easy monitoring by the rig crew for troubleshooting purposes. Automation scenarios are presented for tripping and Managed Pressure Drilling operations that demonstrate the ease of use. Multiple control strategies are developed for each task, and compared against criteria that include easy comprehension of the algorithm and optimality. This automation approach can help reduce some of the current barriers to broad scale adoption of automation. "

                    "abstract": "70%–80% of all formations drilled globally are identified as shales, i.e. argillaceous rocks that contain significant amounts of clays. In addition, the US Energy Information Administration conservatively estimates that 26% of recoverable oil and gas resources of the United States alone are contained in shale formations (EIA Annual Energy Outlook, 2014). Accordingly, there has been an increasing focus on efficient drilling of tight shaly formations, as encountered for instance in long horizontal laterals of unconventional wells. Improvements in PDC bit design and low friction cutter technology need to be mentioned in particular, which have made PDCs the bits of choice in all but the hardest formations. The question now arises where the next step change in rate-of-penetration (ROP) improvement for PDC bits is going to come from. The answer lies in optimizing the intricate relationship between bit, intact and failed rock, and the drilling fluid. When shales are drilled with PDC cutters, a built-up \"detritus\" edge of failed rock will temporarily adhere to the cutter and prevent it from cutting new rock effectively. Disrupting this detritus may significantly reduce friction at the bit and improve PDC cutting efficiency. This appeared to be the case when high salinity formate muds were tested in the Deep Trek downhole drilling investigation reported on in 2007–2008. The merits of high salinity formate muds, which significantly out- drilled even oil-based mud at high densities during Deep Trek, were duly noted but never fully explained. In this paper, it is proposed that the mechanism responsible for the Deep Trek ROP results with formate mud is chemical osmosis, which effectively draws water from the drilled shale and generates a lubricating layer between the cutter and the shale that disrupts the detritus and allows the bit to be cleaned more effectively through the hydraulic nozzle flow, thereby enhancing ROP. Support for the proposed mechanism is provided by an extensive set of laboratory tests, ranging from simple hot-rolling tests that measure accretion tendencies of shale on steel, to realistic drilling tests on full-scale equipment and actual PDC bits under downhole conditions. The results show unequivocally that high salinity muds yield consistently lower accretion tendency and 50–60% higher ROP in shales, and that the underlying mechanism appears to be chemical osmosis. Moreover, positive results of field trials conducted in Canada, where application of formate fluids allowed oil/synthetic mud drill rates to be significantly exceeded, further support the hypothesis of the merits of chemical osmosis for ROP enhancement. The osmosis phenomenon is well-known for borehole stabilization in oil/synthetic-based muds and high salinity water-based muds, but has never before been deliberately deployed for ROP enhancement in shales.

                    "abstract": "New high-frequency downhole recorders and high-bandwidth real-time data transmission tools (such as wired drillpipe) are heralding the era of big data in drilling. Nevertheless, high-frequency data is not yet used to its full potential, as the industry is only just beginning to make sense out of the many gigabytes of recorded data. Analysis of high-frequency data appears to be particularly useful to better characterize and understand vibration events, which are prominent technical limiters of drilling performance. The wealth of information provided by high-frequency vibration patterns, which are not present in low-frequency surface data, offers the possibility to significantly improve vibration mitigation methods. This, in turn, offers opportunities for step-changes in drilling performance improvement. A simple kinematic model was developed to study the expected high-frequency acceleration measurement output under whirl and stick-slip vibrational dysfunctions. The vibration patterns predicted by the model matched the patterns observed in high-frequency field data very well, both in the time and frequency domain. The comparison reveals essential details of the downhole kinematics of vibrational modes, particularly regarding the nature of whirl, which may eventually lead to the development and application of novel whirl mitigation methods. The match between modeled and field data also seems to show that the downhole high-frequency vibration patterns are apparently largely independent from specific operational parameters as well as borehole geometry. Moreover, vibration patterns appear to be more useful to classify and quantify vibration than absolute vibration parameter values. Using the premise that vibration patterns hold the key to vibration identification and ultimately mitigation, a new methodology was developed and applied to extract and analyze essential features from high-frequency vibration data for identification purposes. Using a Bayesian approach with training supervised learning algorithms, vibrations were automatically classified with a success rate in excess of 90% when applied to high-frequency field datasets. Introduction Drill string vibrations are frequent and persistent drilling performance limiters. Severe levels of vibrations might lead to potential damage of downhole tools, while mild levels of vibrations can already significantly slow down drilling progress (Ertas et al., 2013). Over the past 50 years, the drilling industry has used vibration models to represent downhole kinematics and dynamics in order to understand, detect and eventually mitigate these undesired oscillating movements of the drillstring (Shor et al., 2014). Some of the models, especially those aiming to mitigate stick-slip vibrations through surface torque and RPM control, have met with considerable success and are widely implemented in drilling operations. Early models were often not capable of reproducing the complexities of real drilling dysfunctions such as multiple vibrational modes acting together, the impact of unknown and constantly changing parameters such as formation properties, or the geometry of a flexible drillstring thousands of feet in length. More sophisticated finite element models are starting to take such complexities into account, but they often have the disadvantage of requiring significant calculation times. This limits their application in real-time, for instance when comparing modeled results with real-time high-frequency data. "

Two class H cements and other API cement types were investigated in the work.  Alternative cements were also contaminated with the SBM for comparison with the Portland slurries. Results from the first phase of our work clarify the detailed contamination behavior of portland cements, showing the susceptibility of portland slurries to such contaminations.  Results for alternative cementing formulations indicate distinctly lower sensitivity to SBM contamination. These results then provide a first set of guidelines on how to minimize and possibly avoid SBM cement contamination, which is expected to greatly help guarantee primary cementing success and proper zonal isolation in deepwater wells.

                    "abstract": "Blow-out prevention and formation gas/fluid influx control is a major concern in any drilling operation. In conventional drilling, the only widely accepted response to a gas influx is to shut the well in on the BOPs. New Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) technology using the constant bottom-hole pressure (CBHP) technique allows for circulating small and medium-sized influxes out without the need to shut in the well, either by increasing casing back-pressure and/or adjusting pump flow rate. Evident benefits include a faster response to the influx (with clear safety benefits) and a considerable time and cost savings compared to the conventional approach. Unfortunately, there is currently no method available to decide upon the best MPD-CBHP response during an influx, because such a response depends on many parameters, such as Maximum Allowable Surface Pressure (MASP), wellbore geometry, fracture pressure of any weak zones exposed in open hole, type of drilling fluid, influx size, etc. To remedy this situation, we present a fast and accurate decision-making method that overcomes the traditional difficulties and automatically selects a best well control response. The method incorporates a transient multi-phase model based on mass, energy and momentum conservation. A sophisticated numerical simulator was developed for this purpose. Comparing the actual well response with simulated results during an influx event and following the proposed algorithm allows the best response to be taken in a quick, convenient, and accurate manner. Moreover, the approach lends itself well to fully automated control. Here, we describe the new method and its validation using available two-phase experimental data for annular air-mud flow for a wide range of flow rates and flow regimes. We believe that the method provides a powerful new decision-making and design tool in MPD operations that ensures delivery of safer wells with lower non-productive time and associated trouble cost spent on well control operations.

This 30,000-ft well, drilled from the Ursa tension-leg platform (TLP) at a vertical depth of 18,000 ft and a horizontal displacement (HD) of 20,000 ft, targeted the Yellow sand in the Ursa-Princess section of the greater Mars-Ursa basin. During the drilling of the original hole (OH), two subsequent sidetracks, and two mechanical bypasses, a number of significant hole problems materialized that caused extensive nonproductive time (NPT) and an associated cost overrun. These problems were clearly associated with the drilling of a complex well that combined a high-deviation and extended-reach wellbore with a very narrow and pressure-depleted drilling window, characteristic of the GOM's challenging geopressured environment. In all, at least five independent borehole-failure mechanisms were encountered while drilling the OH and its successive sidetracks/ bypasses, which were exacerbated by an additional complicating factor: An extensive lookback study was carried out on the Ursa A-10 well, leading to the development of several important lessons learned and best practices [e.g., for hole cleaning, equivalent-circulating- density (ECD) management, sag control], and to the development of new systems (including novel, sag-resistant synthetic- based-mud formulations).

In addition, a beneficial casing “smear” effect (CSE) has been observed in recent years during drilling with casing (DWC) operations, preventing lost circulation even when drilling highly depleted formations. CSE mimics WBS effects observed during regular drilling operations in its ability to effectively extend fracture gradients and prevent lost circulation, which is of great benefit to drilling difficult wells with tight drilling margins such as (ultra-)deepwater wells. In fact, when used appropriately, WBS and CSE may offer well construction benefits that are on par with those of managed pressure drilling (MPD) and dual gradient drilling (DGD), at reduced equipment usage, complexity and cost. To explain WBS and CSE phenomena, a variety of different mechanisms have been proposed. These broadly fall into three categories: (1) Wellbore Face Sealing (WFS) - forming a uniform seal around the wellbore that prevents fluid leak-off and interferes with fracturing; (2) Wellbore Stress Augmentation (WSA) - augmenting the closure stress around the wellbore by propping open induced fractures either at the wellbore face or somewhere into the fracture; (3) Fracture Propagation Resistance (FPR) - effective solids plugging of any fracture tip, thereby interfering with effective fracture growth. In the proposed paper, we offer a re-examination of previously published data (such as open-hole leak-off tests) and theoretical results, and present our own independent results and assessments to show that WBS and CSE have a common, unified origin. It will be shown that the only mechanism that explains all the data obtained to date is, in fact, the FPR mechanism.

Despite the abundant unconventional reservers, the production is still hindered by many obstacles including lack of technology and knowledge of the physics of flow in tight porous media. Flowing the tightly-locked hydrocarbon to the well in such formations, unlike the conventionals, requires a large number of inter-connecting pathways for flow. The existing in-situ cracks in rock have to be connected in order for the hydrocarbon to flow into the wellbore. In this paper we go over the basic mechanisms of rock fracture in micro and Macro levels and then study the two parameters whose variations could reduce the effective stress and lead to rock fracturing. We then discuss the effect of inhomogeneity on the fracture load and show that the dominant load for thermal fracturing is the tensile stress. There are three governing equations of stress, heat transfer, and flow which should be solved in a coupled fashion, for which we are using the finite element software packages. Assuming that thermal cracks increase the permeability of rock in the near wellbore zone by 10-10,000 times, we show the impact of rock stimulation by thermal shock on cumulative production of gas from a sample case of a wellbore placed in a tight formation. The improved recovery for the sample case is 16%. "

This primarily involves monitoring and correctly interpreting all the data collected at the rig site. In the past, this was primarily accomplished with an experienced drilling crew. While we still continue to use mostly antiquated rig sensors that were introduced decades ago, there has also been an \"explosion?? in the number of new advanced sensors used on a rig. The argument put forward for the additional sensors is that they increase safety and help reduce non-productive time and invisible lost time. Many of these new sensors provide data at high(er) sampling rates. This has made human monitoring of the data very difficult, if not impossible, and has led to a variety of event detection algorithms. The primary function of these event detection algorithms is to bring the driller's attention to anomalies in the system, based on data collected from all the rig sensors. However, the frequent occurrences of false and missed alarms, when using automated event detection software, can lead to significant downtime, and also reduce safety at the rig. One reason for these false alarms is bad data due to either sensor failure or data communication failure. Having sophisticated sensors, but not knowing whether the data can be trusted, defeats the very purpose of having additional sensors. This paper explores a methodology that can greatly reduce these false and missed alarms by validating the data coming from the sensors. "

The hostile and uncertain environment in which sensors are used and the lower priority/importance usually given to regular calibration of these sensors to ensure accuracy are the main reasons for the lack of good quality and reliable data. Today, online streaming of sensor data from at least all the primary sensors on a rig to a real-time data monitoring facility is becoming commonplace. There also exists software to analyze this data, in real-time, to detect trends and identify potential drilling problems long before they occur. However, these software applications require good quality data to perform accurate analysis. When data is not validated, false and missed alarms are the norm whereby supposedly autonomous software applications require continuous human supervision. High quality data will also be required in the near future when adopting control algorithms for rig automation, which will use this data for making autonomous, closed-loop decisions. In this paper, a novel technique for real-time sensor data validation is proposed that improves the quality of data collected from the sensors on a rig. This technique uses a model-based approach and the principle of conditional independence. Here, a sensor probabilistic graphical model is created and the relational redundancies in the model are exploited to differentiate between a sensor fault and a process fault as well as to identify the faulty sensor. The approach described in this paper allows for model update in real-time to account for process degradation/changes, thereby alleviating problems associated with the use of a purely analytical model. The application of the algorithm on a generated data set and the results of the experiment are presented in this paper. The adoption of such techniques is expected to greatly enhance the safety and the performance of well drilling and pave the path forward for more automated rig operations. "

                    "abstract": "This paper details the case history of the highly challenging extended reach deepwater A-10 well, drilled in the Ursa (\"Bear\" in Latin) prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. This 30,000 ft well, drilled from the Ursa TLP at a vertical depth of 18,000 ft and a horizontal displacement of 20,000 ft, targeted the Yellow sand in the Ursa-Princess section of the greater Mars-Ursa basin. During the drilling of the original hole, a subsequent sidetrack and two mechanical bypasses, a number of significant hole problems materialized which caused extensive non-productive time and an associated cost overrun. These problems were clearly associated with the drilling of a complex well that combined a high deviation and extended reach wellbore with a very narrow and pressure-depleted drilling window, characteristic of the Gulf of Mexico's challenging geopressured environment. In all, at least five independent borehole failure mechanisms were encountered while drilling the original hole and its successive sidetracks/bypasses, which were exacerbated by an additional complicating factor: • Lost circulation in natural fractures, ultimately responsible for the loss of the Ursa A-10 original hole. • Lost circulation in induced fractures, with associated heavy mud losses. • Borehole fatigue, caused by stress cycling on weak formations due to annular pressure fluctuations. • Borehole instability caused by too low downhole hydrostatic pressure, responsible for the loss of Ursa A-10 sidetrack 1. • Borehole instability caused by an in-situ fractured formation that proved hard to stabilize on wells Ursa A-10 sidetrack 1 bypasses 1 & 2, and ultimately forced the well to be completed in shallower Magenta sands. • Complicating Factor: barite sag of synthetic based mud in high-deviation wellbores, which led to exacerbation and complication of the previous failure mechanisms. An extensive lookback study was carried out on the Ursa A-10 well, leading to the development of several important lessons learned and best practices (for hole cleaning, ECD management, sag control etc.), and the development of new systems (including novel, sag-resistant synthetic-based mud formulations). A succinct overview of the Ursa A-10 case history and a comprehensive summary of its learnings are provided here in order to help the future drilling of extended reach wells in geopressured, low-margin deepwater environments.

The main drivers for the use of these centers are: • More wells can be directionally drilled with the involvement of the most knowledgeable / most experienced directional drilling / MWD/LWD / geosteering staff, while at the same time new staff can be trained and developed effectively from a central location. • Safety is improved by having less staff commuting back and forth to the rig site (i.e. reducing the number of driving-related accidents), and by reducing occupational exposure through the decrease in number of people \"in harm's way?? present at the rig-site itself. • Remote geosteering at a central facility allows for efficient communication between geologists and interpreters, with a single geosteering expert and a single geologist being able to handle a large number of geosteering operations at the same time, while at the same time greatly improving the speed of decision-making. • Staying within the shale target zone and reduction of the number of geosteering corrections and doglegs while landing the horizontal section, resulting in noticeably improved wellbore quality, which yields immediate benefits in the ease of running production casing and will ultimately translate in higher hydrocarbon recovery. The learnings and best practices associated with the ongoing implementation of the remote drilling centers for unconventional shale drilling operations in the Americas are compiled. This includes a review of the technologies involved, the new workflows that were implemented, how the \"people issues?? were addressed, and what results - including a 90% improvement in the speed of decision making, clear improvements in wellbore placement and quality, and the drilling of best-in-class directional wells in the Eagle Ford Shale - were obtained. In addition, the future of remote directional drilling and its extension into drilling automation is briefly discussed. "

                    "abstract": "Drilling depleted or weak zones has always been a challenge, but with the aging of fields and the desire to drill to deeper in-field plays, the situation is becoming more exacerbated. The typical problems associated with drilling these types of intervals are lost circulation, stuck pipe, and wellbore instability, resulting in significant and expensive nonproductive time (NPT) and costly remediation operations. Conventional lost-circulation remedies (e.g., pumping lost-circulation pills and squeezing) have given way to popular wellbore-strengthening solutions. Our approach to strengthening, based on beneficial manipulation of fracture-propagation pressure and continuous application of specialized wellbore-strengthening additives, has had tremendous success in reducing downhole mud losses by more than 80% in Gulf of Mexico (GOM) deepwater operations and dropping the cost of these incidents out of the top 10 contributors to NPT. This paper focuses on the various theories and approaches to wellbore strengthening and what the available field and literature data actually support. Building upon this, the approach of gaining wellbore fortification through fracture-propagation-resistance (FPR) enhancement is introduced, for which experimental results, field data, and case histories are shared. Central to our application of FPR to drill-challenging deepwater production wells is the notion of providing continuous wellbore protection through a novel and unique solids-recovery and reintroduction method that allows for drilling with high concentrations of wellbore-strengthening materials (WSMs) in the drilling fluid.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Given the current economic climate and continued volatility in oil and natural gas prices, extracting maximum benefit from drilling performance optimization is key to the economical exploitation of many resource plays around the world. Shell Upstream Americas is employing a highly effective performance improvement team to help drive performance optimization and the delivery of top quartile performance on its wells in North America and beyond. Central to this group is a dedicated team of optimization engineers that deliver drilling efficiency optimization techniques, the innovative use of real-time optimization centers, and value-adding root-cause failure investigations to various land and offshore well delivery teams in a fit-for-purpose way. Using the optimization approaches taken, it has been possible to help accelerate well delivery times and associated learning curves by as much as a factor of three, often in a minimum amount of time. A main conclusion is therefore that this approach is a highly effective way to bring performance optimization focus to field operations.  This paper highlights the modus operandi of these optimization engineers, the techniques and tools they employ, and the remarkable results achieved. The workflow and organizational structure was applied to well delivery optimization with projects ranging from shale gas drilling in the Continental US and Canada as well as hard rock drilling in the Middle East.  Introduction A perception may exist in the oil and gas industry, and among its many stakeholders, that large multi-national oil and gas companies struggle to compete with smaller national or independent companies due to their size and associated overhead, bureaucracy, adherence to global standards, etc. (Sneider 1993, Morel 2002). Direct costs for multi-national companies may indeed in some cases be higher due to differences in well construction standards and the associated assurance risks that are deemed acceptable, and a higher need for on-site supervision particularly in the area of occupational safety. A high-level generalization about \"slow and expensive?? multi-nationals, however, often fails to recognize some key strengths that larger multi-national companies can bring to the table to make them more competitive. These include the ability to develop (or, with partners, co-develop) important performance improvement technologies and having the in-house resources to mature those technologies and quickly capitalize on them in the field. Any higher upfront costs may then be offset by superior well delivery performance, and in particular by improvements in well delivery time. This theme is explored in the present paper, where we show how technologies for drilling efficiency were successfully deployed in the onshore gas plays of the United States and Canada, thereby accelerating learning curves and making well delivery operations in these areas highly competitive. Moreover, the learnings from these operations were quickly carried over to other areas, most notably hard rock drilling operations in the Middle East.  Methodology Typical challenges faced by well delivery teams of multi-national oil and gas companies operating in larger regions such as the North Americas Tight/Shale Gas Play include: •  Large variation in geographical regions, geologies encountered, formations drilled, etc. •  Multiple, dispersed, and oftentimes \"silo-ed?? delivery teams •  Inconsistent workflows between teams •  Segmented data collection and storage points (Morris 2008, Gryskiewicz 2009) "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Nonproductive time (NPT) caused by preventable tool and equipment failures in offshore drilling and completion operations typically accounts for 5% of well delivery time, but can reach as high as 30%[1]. This equates to millions of dollars per year that could have been spent on other well delivery opportunities. Mutual benefit exists for both operators and vendors to dedicate the time and effort necessary to consistently perform comprehensive investigations and develop effective solutions to mitigate risk of repeat failures. A one-sided or inadequately supported approach to failure response can lead to incomplete analyses and insufficient solutions that treat symptoms rather than root causes, thereby sustaining or creating reliability gaps and allowing further NPT to be incurred.  In recent years, Shell's Gulf of Mexico (GOM) drilling operations formed a specialized, dedicated team to establish and facilitate an effective, sustainable approach to failure response. The team's immediate goal was the reduction of NPT cost associated with drilling tool failures. Long term, the team's objective was to promote a culture within both operator and vendor organizations for effective failure prevention and performance improvement. Via this team consistent representation, influence, and support is maintained during failure response activities. The team enforces vendor failure response expectations and ensures complete, unbiased analyses and solutions with appropriate local, regional and global communication within operator and vendor organizations, such that the chance of repeat failures anywhere in the industry is minimized.  Since inception, the team's efforts have facilitated a significant reduction in NPT, which translates to yearly multi-million-dollar savings. Given its evident success, the scope of this initiative has been expanded within the Americas and also in global operations. This paper reviews the approach and process, clarifies the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities for both operator and suppliers, highlights the mutual benefits for operators and vendors, and illustrates the effectiveness of the approach through its very positive impact on operational NPT reduction.

The two-grid fixed stress split scheme solves the flow subproblem on a fine grid using a multipoint flux mixed finite element method by imposing the fixed mean stress constraint followed by the poromechanics subproblem on a coarse grid using a conforming Galerkin method in every coupling iteration at each time step. Restriction operators map the fine scale flow solution to the coarse scale poromechanical grid and prolongation operators map the coarse scale poromechanical solution to the fine scale flow grid. The coupling iterations are repeated until convergence and Backward Euler is employed for time marching. The convergence analysis is based on studying the equations satisfied by the difference of iterates to show that the two-grid scheme is a contraction map under certain conditions. Those conditions are used to construct the restriction and prolongation operators as well as arrive at effective elastic properties for the coarse scale poromechanical solve in terms of the fine scale elastic properties. We analyze the contraction map with a numerical result comparing the numerically computed to the theoretically obtained contraction constant for a poroelastic medium with substantial spatial variability in the poroelastic moduli.

These methods provide higher order accuracy, geometrical flexibility and adaptive gridding capabilities that are not easy to incorporate in traditional finite difference methods employed for generation of synthetic seismograms. Moreover, several studies have shown that Discontinuous Galerkin FEM (DGM) is a promising approach for modeling wave propagation in fractured media. Here we propose an Enriched Galerkin FEM (EGM) for elastic wave propagation. EGM uses the same bilinear form as DGM and the continuous Galerkin finite element spaces enriched by discontinuous piecewise constants or bilinear functions. EGM satisfies local equilibrium while reducing the degrees of freedom in DGM formulations. In this paper, we consider elastic wave propagation and derive optimal a priori error estimates for DGM and EGM. We present numerical examples in two spatial dimensions that confirm these theoretical results. In addition, we provide numerical comparisons with the Spectral element method. In previous work, DGM has been shown to be effective in modeling elastic wave propagation in fractured media using the linear slip model. We now extend these results to EGM with reduced computational costs over DGM. "

This study presents numerical results of field pulse testing experiments that are designed to detect leakage based on pressure monitoring data for periodical CO2 injection at a CO2 enhanced oil recovery field in Mississippi, USA. In the pulse test, sinusoidal pressure patterns are captured in transitional pressure data because CO2 injection and shut-in are repeated. The patterns are parameterized and history-matched efficiently in the frequency domain. Sensitivity analyses of pulse test parameters such as injection period and rate show that the frequency domain is more advantageous than the time domain for estimating leakage probability and well connectivity. We also conduct multi-objective history matching of pulse testing parameters in the frequency domain for reducing the uncertainty in geological models. This history matching reveals a clearer trade-off relationship between the matching qualities than conventional global-objective history matching, thereby being advantageous to yielding converged and diversified geological models for uncertainty quantification.

Therefore flue gas can be directly injected into the oil and gas reservoirs to eliminate the cost of CO2 separation from power plant emissions and simultaneously enhance hydrocarbon production that may offset the cost of gas compression. However, gas injection in subsurface resources is often subject to poor volumetric sweep efficiency caused by low viscosity and low density of the injection fluid and formation heterogeneity. This paper aims to study gas mobility control techniques of water alternating gas (WAG) and foam in Cranfield via field-scale simulations. A coupled compositional flow and geomechanics simulator, IPARS, is used to accurately simulate the underlying physical processes. A hysteretic relative permeability model enables modeling local capillary trapping. Foam mobility control technique is examined to investigate the eminent level of CO2 capillary trapping by an implicit texture foam model. The coupled flow-geomechanics model can detect the effect of the plausible interaction of geomechanics and fluid flow on CO2 plume extension by analyzing the critical pressure that could induce hydraulic fracturing. Field-scale simulations indicate that during WAG and foam processes, the oil recovery increased 1.35 times and 1.6 times; and CO2 storage increased by 13.6% and 38.7% of total gas injection during the injection period compared to continuous gas flooding, respectively. During SAG process, coupling geomechanics will significantly increase the predicted gas storage volume, as a result of reservoir pore volume increase. Furthermore, analysis of the pressure margin for inducing hydraulic fracturing ensured the safety of SAG operation. "

                    "abstract": "Subsurface CO2 injection and storage alters formation pressure. Changes of pore pressure may result in fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing if the pressure exceeds the corresponding thresholds. Most simulation models predict such thresholds utilizing relatively homogeneous reservoir rock models and do not account for CO2 dissolution in the brine phase to calculate pore pressure evolution. This study presents an estimation of reservoir capacity in terms of allowable injection volume and rate utilizing the Frio CO2 injection site in the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as a case study. The work includes laboratory core testing, well-logging data analyses, and reservoir numerical simulation. We built a fine-scale reservoir model of the Frio pilot test in our in-house reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We first performed history matching of the pressure transient data of the Frio pilot test, and then used this history-matched reservoir model to investigate the effect of the CO2 dissolution into brine and predict the implications of larger CO2 injection volumes. Our simulation results –including CO2 dissolution– exhibited 33% lower pressure build-up relative to the simulation excluding dissolution. Capillary heterogeneity helps spread the CO2 plume and facilitate early breakthrough. Formation expansivity helps alleviate pore pressure build-up. Simulation results suggest that the injection schedule adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not affect the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Fault reactivation requires injection volumes of at least about sixty times larger than the actual injected volume at the same injection rate. Hydraulic fracturing necessitates much larger injection rates than the ones used in the Frio pilot test. Tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in-situ effective stresses. Hence, we do not expect an increase of fault permeability in the Frio sand even in the presence of fault reactivation. "

                    "abstract": "Desirable outcomes for geologic carbon storage include maximizing storage efficiency, preserving injectivity, and avoiding unwanted consequences such as caprock or wellbore leakage or induced seismicity during and post injection. To achieve these outcomes, three control measures are evident including pore pressure, injectate chemistry, and knowledge and prudent use of geologic heterogeneity. Field, experimental, and modeling examples are presented that demonstrate controllable GCS via these three measures. Observed changes in reservoir response accompanying CO2 injection at the Cranfield (Mississippi, USA) site, along with lab testing, show potential for use of injectate chemistry as a means to alter fracture permeability (with concomitant improvements for sweep and storage efficiency). Further control of reservoir sweep attends brine extraction from reservoirs, with benefit for pressure control, mitigation of reservoir and wellbore damage, and water use. State-of-the-art validated models predict the extent of damage and deformation associated with pore pressure hazards in reservoirs, timing and location of networks of fractures, and development of localized leakage pathways. Experimentally validated geomechanics models show where wellbore failure is likely to occur during injection, and efficiency of repair methods. Use of heterogeneity as a control measure includes where best to inject, and where to avoid attempts at storage. An example is use of waste zones or leaky seals to both reduce pore pressure hazards and enhance residual CO2 trapping. "

The typical approach is to either impose an overburden pressure directly on the reservoir thus treating it as a coupled problem domain or to model flow on a huge domain with zero permeability cells to mimic the no flow boundary condition on the interface of the reservoir and the surrounding rock. The former approach precludes a study of land subsidence or uplift and further does not mimic the true effect of the overburden on stress sensitive reservoirs whereas the latter approach has huge computational costs. In order to address these challenges, we augment the fixed-stress split iterative scheme with upscaling and downscaling operators to enable modeling flow and mechanics on overlapping nonmatching hexahedral grids. Flow is solved on a finer mesh using a multipoint flux mixed finite element method and mechanics is solved on a coarse mesh using a conforming Galerkin method. The multiscale operators are constructed using a procedure that involves singular value decompositions, a surface intersections algorithm and Delaunay triangulations. We numerically demonstrate the convergence of the augmented scheme using the classical Mandel's problem solution. "

                    "abstract": "One of the major objectives in the development of upscaling approaches is to reduce the computational costs associated with solving fine scale flow and transport problems in heterogeneous porous media. This is due to the availability of reservoir rock property data at fine spatial scales, such as facies distributions, obtained from geological models and field data from well logs. The data sets from each of these sources are themselves at different spatial scales which further adds to the computational challenge. The upscaling approach must not only accommodate these disparate data sets but also capture the flow physics accurately while maintaining computational efficiency. We present a novel upscaling approach which draws upon previous developments of two-scale homogenization (Amaziane et al., 2006) to obtain coarse scale properties in addition to dynamic mesh refinement using an enhanced velocity mixed finite element method (EV MFEM) (Wheeler et al., 2002). A transient region is defined where changes in saturation/concentration are above a chosen threshold compared to a non-transient region where these are relatively small. Since most of the recovery technologies employed in oil and gas field operations involve flooding the subsurface porous medium; as in the case of water-flooding, chemical or gas enhanced oil recovery (EOR), these aforementioned transient regions are usually restricted to much smaller subdomains of the entire reservoir domain. The computational efficiency is achieved by using coarse scale parameters, from numerical homogenization, in the non-transient region. Furthermore, the solution accuracy is preserved by using fine scale information only in the transient region. The numerical results section shows that our adaptive homogenization approach closely captures fine scale flow and transport features while maintaining a computational speedup of approximately 4 times for a variety of permeability distributions extracted from the SPE 10 comparative upscaling project (Christie and Blunt, 2001).

We employ a novel equi-dimensional approach for meshing fractures. By using polyhedral cells we avoid the common challenge in equi-dimensional fracture modeling of creating small cells at the intersection point. We also demonstrate how polyhedra can mesh complex fractures without introducing a large number of cells. We use polyhedra and the MFD method a second time for embedding fracture boundaries in the matrix domain using a “cut-cell” paradigm. The embedding approach has the advantage of being simple and localizes irregular cells to the area around the fractures. It also circumvents the need for conventional mesh generation, which can be challenging when applied to complex fracture geometries. We present numerical results confirming the validity of our approach for complex fracture networks and for different flow models. In our first example, we compare our method to the popular dual-porosity technique. Our second example compares our method with directly meshed fractures (single-porosity) for two-phase flow. The third example demonstrates two-phase flow for the case of intersecting ellipsoid fractures in three-dimensions, which are typical in microseismic analysis of fractures. Finally, we demonstrate our method on a two-dimensional fracture network produced from microseismic field data. "

In this paper, we propose a technique that implements a phase-field approach to propagate fractures and their interaction with existing fracture networks using surface deflection data. The latter one provides a probability map of fractures in a heterogeneous reservoir. These data are used to initialize both the location of the fractures and the phase-field function. In addition, this approach has the potential for optimizing well placement/spacing for fluid-filled fracture propagation for oil and gas production and or carbon sequestration and utilization. Using prototype models based on realistic field data, we demonstrate the effects of interactions between existing and propagating fractures in terms of several numerical simulations with different probability thresholds, locations, and numbers of fractures. Our results indicate that propagating fractures interact in a complex manner with the existing fracture network. The modeled propagation of hydraulic fractures is sensitive to the threshold employed within the phase-field approach for delineating fractures. "

Understanding reservoir capacity and geomechanical implications of CO2 injection are necessary for safe and effective storage. Large pore pressure increases from injection may induce fault reactivation and seal failure, and compromise storage integrity. Several studies examined the Frio brine pilot CO2 sequestration project conducted in Dayton, Texas. However, geomechanical implications were not fully evaluated at that time besides calculations required for a class V well permit. This article presents a comprehensive case study to evaluate pore pressure increase due to CO2 injection at the Frio injection site. The work includes new laboratory experiments and well-logging data analyses. The results are consistently assimilated into a numerical reservoir model which includes compositional flow. A fine-scale reservoir model of the Frio pilot test is developed in our in-house reservoir simulator IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). We perform history matching of the pressure transient data of Frio pilot test, and the history-matched reservoir model is used to predict the implications of larger CO2 injection volumes. Reservoir simulation results show that injection rates adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not upset the mechanical integrity of the storage complex. Higher and sustained injection rates may increase pore pressure beyond limits for fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing. A change of over a few-hundreds-psi could cause the sand to reach the shear yield stress. However, tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in-situ effective stresses suggesting that reaching shear yield stress in neighboring faults may not jeopardize the sealing integrity of faults.

                    "abstract": "Permanent deformations in the solid matrix can be caused by many field scenarios, such as high injection rates. A pressure differential in the field can create geomechanical loading of large magnitude that may increase stress from an elastic regime to a plastic regime. Simple geomechanical models based on linear elasticity are insufficient in predicting these types of effects. To accurately predict rock formation damage and failure responses, nonlinear analyses based on geomaterial plasticity models should be included in modeling frameworks through rigorous coupling with reservoir flow simulators. In this work we integrate an implementation of the Drucker-Prager plasticity model into the parallel compositional reservoir simulator, IPARS (Integrated Parallel Accurate Reservoir Simulator). Fluid flow is formulated on general distorted hexahedral grids using the multipoint flux mixed finite element method. The mechanics and flow systems are solved separately and coupled using a fixed-stress iterative coupling algorithm. This allows multiple flow models to be used with nonlinear mechanics without modification, and allows each type of physics to employ the best preconditioner for its linear systems. The fixed-stress iteration converges to the fully coupled solution on each time step. With these components in place, we conduct a study on wellbore stability using different flow and geomaterial models. We demonstrate the capabilities of our integrated simulator in predicting near-wellbore plastic strain development and its effect on multiphase component concentrations. Our simulations run efficiently in parallel using MPI on high performance computing platforms up to hundreds or thousands of processors. The results of the simulations are useful in predicting wellbore failure. Our integrated simulator has several distinctive features. The use of general hexahedral finite element grids is particularly well-suited to handle domain specific applications such as near-wellbore studies. The multipoint flux scheme is an accurate and convergent method, it is locally conservative, and its linear systems are efficiently solved with multigrid methods. The use of a fixed-stress iterative coupling scheme is novel for coupling nonlinear mechanics with compositional fluid flow. Finally, to achieve fast convergence rates for solving nonlinear solid mechanics problems, a material integrator has been consistently formulated to give quadratic convergence rates. "

Detrending followed by Fourier transform is adopted to decompose sinusoidal pressure anomalies induced by a periodic injection of CO2 into frequencies used as target parameters of history matching. The secondary objective is to calibrate the geologic model of the test site by reducing the discrepancy between observed and simulated Fourier parameters and assess uncertainties associated with the compositional brine-CO2 flow. An assisted history matching tool that mounts global- and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is developed, integrated with an in-house flow-geomechanics simulator, and employed to manage pulse testing simulations with a low computational cost in high-performance parallel computing environments. Grid cells in the test site are locally refined using enhanced-velocity that allows nonmatching grids on interfaces between subdomains. Experiments performed with one pulser well and two monitoring wells under steady-state conditions are considered baselines for subsequent experiments that convert one monitoring well into a production well as an artificial CO2 leakage pathway. The difference between the pressure anomalies obtained from the baseline and leak experiments are captured as a signal of CO2 leakage detection with reliability in the simulation results. A trade-off relationship between the matching qualities at the two monitoring wells is revealed more clearly by invoking multi-objective history matching than conventional global-objective history matching. This comparative study to investigate the significance of multi-objective optimization in subsurface characterization represents that diversity-preservation in the ensemble composed of qualified geologic models has the advantage of reducing bias for uncertainty quantification.

In particular, numerical simulations of viscous fingering instabilities in heterogeneous porous media and Hele–Shaw cells are illustrated. EG is formulated by enriching the conforming continuous Galerkin finite element method (CG) with piecewise constant functions. The method provides locally and globally conservative fluxes, which are crucial for coupled flow and transport problems. Moreover, EG has fewer degrees of freedom in comparison with discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and an efficient flow solver has been derived which allows for higher order schemes. Dynamic adaptive mesh refinement is applied in order to reduce computational costs for large-scale three dimensional applications. In addition, entropy residual based stabilization for high order EG transport systems prevents spurious oscillations. Numerical tests are presented to show the capabilities of EG applied to flow and transport. "

The formulation of the coupled system involves four unknowns: displacements, phase field, pressure, and proppant concentration. The two-field displacement phase-field system is solved fully-coupled and accounts for crack irreversibility. This solution is then coupled to the pressure equation via a fixed-stress iteration. The pressure is obtained by using a diffraction equation where the phase-field variable serves as an indicator function that distinguishes between the fracture and the reservoir. The transport of the proppant in the fracture is modeled by using a power-law fluid system. The numerical discretization in space is based on Galerkin finite elements for displacements and phase-field, and an enriched Galerkin method is applied for the pressure equation in order to obtain local mass conservation. The concentration is solved with cell-centered finite elements. Nonlinear equations are treated with Newton’s method.

We adapt the fixed stress split algorithm that decouples the flow and mechanics equations for the multirate case and perform an iteration between the two problems until convergence. We provide a fully discrete scheme that uses Backward Euler time discretization and mixed spaces for flow and conformal Galerkin for mechanics. Our analysis is based on studying the equations satisfied by the difference of iterates and using Banach contraction argument to prove that the corresponding scheme is a fixed point contraction. The analysis provides the value of an adjustable coefficient used in the proposed iterative coupling algorithms.

Recent experiments show difference in solubility for brine solutions with equal ionic strength but different salts (NaCl, CaCl2 and KCl). Hence, current methods that incorporate the effect of ions solely by measuring the ionic strength are inadequate to model CO2 solubility in brine. In this research, a new solubility model that accounts for the presence of particular ions has been developed using the Gibbs free energy minimization model. The Gibbs free energy function provides the advantage of combining different thermodynamic models - Equation of State (EOS) for hydrocarbon or gas phase components and activity coefficient model for aqueous phase components. The developed model uses Pitzer activity coefficients for aqueous phase components where experimental data available for individual salt mixtures have been used to tune coefficients. We use this solubility model to quantify the impact of particular ions for CO2 sequestration application. We discuss strategies for modifying the brine composition that can increase CO2 solubility and hence, aid CO2 sequestration. "

                    "abstract": "A model selection process based on multi-objective optimization using a fast proxy is presented that chooses geologic models conditioned to observed flow and geomechanical responses. The responses of geologic models to injection of large volumes of CO2 are evaluated using a proxy that approximates pressure distribution using a random walk particle tracking algorithm and computes surface deformation using a stress-field solver. The geologic models showing similar proxy responses are grouped into clusters by invoking multi-dimensional scaling and k-means clustering. A representative model of each cluster is chosen and its simulation results are compared to the observation. The resultant posterior ensemble consists of models that belong to one or more clusters whose representative models are not only in good agreement with given observation data but also non-dominated to other representative models. The usefulness of the model selection approach is demonstrated on CO2 sequestration of a fractured gas reservoir at In Salah, Central Algeria. The explicit coupling of the connectivity estimator and the stress solver reproduces similar migration patterns of CO2 plume to those obtained using full-physics numerical simulations. Incorporating time-lapse observations measured using satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar imposes additional constraints to refine geologic models by improving the matching quality of bottomhole pressure, and thereby contributes to a further reduction in geologic uncertainty. The multi-objective optimization process implemented in the model selection process yields a diversified model set than those obtained using a global optimization procedure. The posterior ensemble exhibits consistent geologic characteristics in terms of spatial distribution and orientation of migration pathways. The posterior ensemble is then used as an initial population for a multi-objective history matching procedure. The results of model selection and expansion process indicate that the implementation of Pareto-optimality is advantageous to realize diversified geologic models that yield unbiased assessment of uncertainty associated with prediction of future CO2 plume migration.

                    "abstract": "Hydrocarbon production from unconventional resources such as shale usually entails stimulation by hydraulic fracturing, which results in nonplanar (curved) fractures. However, most reservoir models assume that the induced fractures are planar for the sake of simplicity. Considering the growing interest of the petroleum industry in better understanding production from these resources, we develop a fracture-cell model to capture the effects of fracture nonplanarity on transport properties. To build a realistic reservoir model for a fractured formation, we must account for three types of interactions: matrix-matrix (M-M), matrix-fracture (M-F), and fracture-fracture (F-F). The transport properties of the M-M interaction are based on laboratory measurements. In this study, we analytically determine the transport properties of the two other types of interactions (M-F and F-F). For this purpose, we account for the aperture size and spatial location of the fracture. As a result, we provide effective porosity and effective anisotropic permeabilities for a reservoir cell that contains a fracture inside it. The reservoir cell with transport properties that are modified is a fracture cell. We implement the fracture-cell model in a reservoir simulator and perform analyses for a single fracture and for multiple intersecting fractures; these fractures are nonplanar. The analyses include both single- and multiphase flow models and show that the hydrocarbon pressure inside the reservoir is strongly dependent on the fracture geometry when the matrix permeability is smaller than 1 µd. Thus, it is crucial to model the fracture geometry more accurately in unconventional reservoirs with ultralow permeabilities such as shale. One can easily implement the developed fracture-cell model in reservoir simulators, and there is no local refinement around the fracture. The main advantage of the proposed model is its simplicity, conjoined with its ability to capture the nonplanarity of the fracture. The developed model has major applications for understanding production from formations that are heavily fractured. "

This approach is thermodynamically consistent and captures several characteristic features of crack propagation such as joining, branching, and nonplanar propagation as a result of heterogeneous material properties. We describe two different phase-field fracture-propagation models and then present a technique for coupling these to a fractured-poroelastic-reservoir simulator. The proposed coupling approach can be adapted to existing reservoir simulators.

The effect of changes in the aqueous composition on the relative permeability is commonly neglected in both experiments and models and may lead to erroneous predictions of reservoir performance. Therefore, we have developed a general framework to calculate aqueous-composition- dependent relative permeability. The expected relative permeability must be continuous and cover the entire saturation and composition space for the desired process, pressure, and temperature. The proposed model (UTPGE model) acts as a unifying bridge among thermodynamics, petrophysics, geochemistry, and electrolyte. It can seamlessly be used to evaluate aqueous relative permeability in oil recovery and hydrology applications. The proposed framework is relative and provides the relative permeability upon two set of measured input relative permeability curves. We select the UTKR3P model as the reference multiphase relative permeability model. One thermodynamic property of the electrolyte system must represent the compositional effect. We select the aqueous phase molar Gibbs free energy (GFE) to represent the bulk property of the electrolyte system. The interface properties, if required, are presented by aqueous- liquid or -gas interfacial tension. Phase GFE is calculated from the aqueous speciation results, i.e. species activity and concentration. The required reference GFE values are calculated by Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equation-of-state (1981) at elevated pressure and temperature. "

Nanoparticles are a promising alternative to surfactants in creating foam in the harsh environments found in many oil fields. We conducted several CO2-in-brine foam generation experiments in Boise sandstones with surface-treated silica nanoparticle in high-salinity conditions. All the experiments were conducted at the fixed CO2 volume fraction (g = 0.75) and fixed flow rate which changed in steps. We started at low flow rates, increased to a medium flow rates followed by decreasing and then increasing into high flow rates. The steady-state foam apparent viscosity was measured as a function of injection velocity. The foam flowing through the cores showed higher foam generation and consequently higher apparent viscosity as the flow rate increased from low to medium and high velocities. At very high velocities, once foam bubbles were finely textured, the foam apparent viscosity was governed by foam shear-thinning rheology rather than foam creation. A noticeable \"hysteresis\" occurred when the flow velocity was initially increased and then decreased, implying multiple (coarse and strong) foam states at the same superficial velocity. A normalized generation function was combined with CMG-STARS foam model to cover the full spectrum of foam flow behavior observed during the experiments. The new foam model successfully captures foam generation and hysteresis trends observed in presented experiments in this study and other foam generation experiments at different operational conditions (e.g. fixed pressure drop at fixed foam quality, and fixed pressure drop at fixed water velocity) from the literature. The results indicate once foam is generated in porous media, it is possible to maintain strong foam at low injection rates. This makes foam more feasible in field applications where foam generation is limited by high injection rates (or high pressure gradient) that may only exist near the injection well. Therefore, understanding of foam generation, and foam hysteresis in porous media and accurate modeling of the process are necessary steps for efficient foam design in field. "

To enforce crack irreversibility as a constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear partial differential equation discretized using finite elements, resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media. "

                    "abstract": "Numerical modeling and simulation are essential tools for developing a better understanding of the geologic characteristics of aquifers and providing technical support for future carbon dioxide (CO2) storage projects. Modeling CO2 sequestration in underground aquifers requires the implementation of models of multiphase flow and CO2 and brine phase behavior. Capillary pressure and relative permeability need to be consistent with permeability/porosity variations of the rock. It is, therefore, crucial to gain confidence in the numerical models by validating the models and results by use of laboratory and field pilot results. A published CO2/brine laboratory coreflood was selected for our simulation study. The experimental results include subcore porosity and CO2-saturation distributions by means of a computed tomography (CT) scanner along with a CO2-saturation histogram. Data used in this paper are all based on those provided by Krause et al. (2011), with the exception of the CT porosity data. We generated a heterogeneous distribution for the porosity but honoring the mean value provided by Krause et al. (2011). We also generated the permeability distribution with the mean value for the whole core given by Krause et al. (2011). All the other data, such as the core dimensions, injection rate, outlet pressure, temperature, relative permeability, and capillary pressure, are the same as those in Krause et al. (2011). High-resolution coreflood simulations of brine displacement with supercritical CO2 are presented with the compositional reservoir simulator IPARS (Wheeler and Wheeler 1990). A 3D synthetic core model was constructed with permeability and porosity distributions generated by use of the geostatistical software FFTSIM (Jennings et al. 2000), with cell sizes of 1.27 x 1.27 x 6.35 mm. The core was initially saturated with brine. Fluid properties were calibrated with the equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model to match the measured data provided by Krause et al. (2011). We used their measured capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. However, we scaled capillary pressure on the basis of the Leverett J-function (Leverett 1941) for permeability, porosity, and interfacial tension (IFT) in every simulation grid cell. Saturation images provide insight into the role of heterogeneity of CO2 distribution in which a slight variation in porosity gives rise to large variations in CO2-saturation distribution in the core. High-resolution numerical results indicated that accurate representation of capillary pressure at small scales was critical. Residual brine saturation and the subsequent shift in the relative permeability curves showed a significant impact on final CO2 distribution in the core. "

                    "abstract": "CO2 flood and polymer flood are two proven and commercially practiced technologies for several decades. Traditional gas flood methods suffer from inadequate sweep efficiency and incomplete recovery of oil. Several methods to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency are practiced in field operations such as water alternating gas (WAG), polymer-gel, and foam-WAG. Polymer is traditionally added to the water flood projects to reduce the mobility of water in an effort to improve the water sweep efficiency and increase oil production especially from heterogeneous reservoirs. Both polymer and gas floods are mature technologies for improved oil recovery. However, few studies have been done on combined application of the two methods. In this paper, we conducted simulation study of the potential benefit of adding polymer to the water in the CO2 WAG process, taking the advantage of CO2 miscibility with oil and polymer conformance control during water cycle. A commercial reservoir simulator CMG-STARS is used in this study, with its PVT module CMG-WinProp. A comprehensive polymer property module is used to calculate the shear thinning rheology and non-linear mixing of polymer solution in addition to the polymer adsorption and mobility reduction factor. Field scale simulations are performed based on a real field geological model and light oil fluid properties, taking into account the heterogeneity and EOR design. The performance of each EOR method on oil recovery is also evaluated, including the water flood, CO2 flood, water alternating gas (WAG), and polymer alternating gas (PAG). Based on this pilot study, polymer alternating gas flood has the highest oil recovery factor of 74%, while WAG has 68% and water flood has 59% oil recovery factor. This field scale simulation study demonstrated positive response of PAG compared to WAG, water, or CO2 floods in oil recovery and total injection. "

                    "abstract": "Ensemble-based algorithms have been successfully implemented for history matching of geological models. However, their performance is optimal only if the prior-state vector is linearly related to the predicted data and if the joint distribution of the prior-state vector is multivariate Gaussian. Moreover, the number of degrees of freedom is as large as the ensemble size, so the assimilation of large amounts of production or seismic data might lead to the ensemble collapse which results in inaccurate predictions of future performance. In this paper, we introduce a methodology that combines model classification with multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the ensemble smoother algorithm to efficiently history match fluvial and channelized reservoir models. The dynamic responses (production and seismic data) of the different ensemble members are used to compute a dissimilarity matrix. This dissimilarity matrix is then transformed into a lower-dimensional space by the use of MDS. Then, model classification is performed based on the distances between the mapped responses in the lower dimensional space and the actual observed response. In the proposed method. the transformed lower-dimensional data are used instead of original observations in the update equation to update the cluster of ensemble members that are closest to the observed response. In this manner, a limited number of ensemble members are enough to assimilate large amount of observed data without triggering the ensemble collapse problem. The updated subset of models (cluster) are used to infer a probability map and/or new hard conditioning data to re-sample new conditional members for the next iteration or next data-assimilation step. The proposed algorithm is tested by assimilating production and time-lapse seismic data into channelized reservoir models. The presented computational results show significant improvements in terms of preserving channelized features and in terms of reliability of predictions compared to the standard implementation of ensemble-based algorithms.

                    "abstract": "Mobility-control methods have the potential to improve coupled enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon dioxide (CO2) storage technique (CO2-EOR). There is a need for improved three-phase relative permeability models with hysteresis, especially including the effects of cycle dependency so that more-accurate predictions of these methods can be made. We propose new three-phase relative permeability and three-phase hysteresis models applicable to different fluid configurations in a porous medium under different wettability conditions. The relative permeability model includes both the saturation history and compositional effects. Three-phase parameters are estimated on the basis of saturation-weighted interpolation of two-phase parameters. The hysteresis model is an extension of the Land trapping model (Land 1968) but with a dynamic Land coefficient introduced. The trapping model estimates a constantly increasing trapped saturation for intermediate-wetting and nonwetting phases. The hysteresis model overcomes some of the limitations of existing three-phase hysteresis models for nonwater-wet rocks and mitigates the complexity associated with commonly applied models in numerical simulators. The relative permeability model is validated by use of multicycle three-phase water-alternating-gas experimental data for nonwater-wet rocks. Numerical simulations of a carbonate reservoir with and without hysteresis were used to assess the effect of the saturation direction and saturation path on gas entrapment and oil recovery. "
