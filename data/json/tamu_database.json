                    "abstract": "The concept of radius of investigation is fundamental to well test analysis and is routinely used to design well tests and to understand the reservoir volume investigated. The radius of investigation can also be useful in identifying new well locations and planning, designing and optimizing hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It has additional implications in estimating reserves and understanding stimulated reservoir volumes. There are many definitions of radius of investigation in the literature and Kuchuk (2009) summarized them recently. Although these definitions vary in detail, they all relate to the propagation of a pressure disturbance or impose thresholds on detectable pressure or rate changes. In this article we will focus on the definition proposed by Lee (1982). Lee defines the radius of investigation as the propagation distance of the “peak” pressure disturbance for an impulse source or sink. For simplified flow geometries and homogeneous reservoir conditions, the radius of investigation can be calculated analytically. However, such analytic solutions are severely limited for heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, particularly for unconventional reservoirs with multistage hydraulic fractures. Generalization of the Concept How can we generalize the concept of radius of investigation to heterogeneous reservoir conditions including unconventional reservoirs with horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fractures? For such general situations, it will be more appropriately called “the depth of investigation” rather than the radius of investigation. The simplest, not necessarily the most desirable, approach will be to use a numerical reservoir simulator. For example, we can simulate a constant rate drawdown test and observe the pressure response at every grid block in the simulation model. It is as if, we have distributed sensors throughout the reservoir. We can now compute the time derivative of the pressure at each grid block and note the time when the derivative reaches a maximum. We can then simply contour this “peak” arrival time at every grid block. Note that because the constant rate test corresponds to a step function (from 0 to Q), its derivative is an impulse function. Thus, by contouring the arrival time of the maximum of the pressure derivative, we are actually looking at the arrival time of the maximum of an impulse response as defined by Lee (1982). How well does the approach work? Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the radius of investigation for homogeneous radial flow using Lee’s analytic solution. Fig. 1b shows the radius of investigation obtained from numerical simulation. We have superimposed the analytic solution (black lines) on the results from the numerical simulation. We do see a close correspondence, although the numerical results have difficulties resolving the pressure transients away from the well. In spite of its limitations, the numerical approach is very general and can be applied to arbitrary reservoir and well conditions. The computation time and expenses, however, make the numerical simulation approach unfeasible for routine applications. "

                    "abstract": "The effective strategies for traditional manual history matching commonly follow a structured approach with a sequence of adjustments from global to regional parameters followed by local changes in model properties, associated with matching for pressure (reservoir energy), flood front progression, and individual well performance. In contrast, many of the automatic history matching methods utilize parameter sensitivities or gradients to directly update the fine-scale reservoir properties, potentially combining elements at all of these scales. In this paper we present a hierarchical streamline-assisted history matching approach that emulates the traditional structured procedures. First, a probabilistic approach is used to understand the uncertainty in the large-scale static and dynamic parameters, and to calibrate these global parameters. In this global calibration, the intent is to develop multiple models that all match the field performance. This global calibration is followed by a streamline sensitivity-based deterministic model calibration for local permeability changes in which each of the distinct models created in the global match are history matched in additional detail. In the probabilistic global calibration, design of experiments and response surface methodologies with evolutionary algorithms are used to calibrate the global parameters. Typical parameters are regional pore volume multipliers, regional vertical and areal transmissibility multipliers, fault transmissibilities and aquifer strength. Key global parameters are first identified via a sensitivity analysis and an initial ensemble of models that span these parameters is created. The cases studied in this sensitivity analysis are used to construct a proxy model using experimental design and response surface analysis. An improved genetic algorithm with heat-bath sampling is used to generate an updated ensemble of models conditioned to static MDT pressures and total liquid rates at the wells, corresponding to a traditional pressure history match. Next, each ensemble member is updated using water-cut, GOR and flowing BHP via sensitivity-based local permeability calibration. We utilize streamline-derived analytic sensitivities to determine the spatial distribution and magnitude of these local changes. The proposed approach was tested by a 3D synthetic case and a field application. Our hierarchical approach appears to be stable in the sense that the local changes for permeability (inner loop) do not invalidate the pressure history match (outer loop). This is not entirely unexpected since the local permeability changes are regularized by a norm constraint that minimizes deviations from the globally updated model. Nonetheless, this is a very useful property in that it allows us to powerfully combine history matching procedures on global and local scales. "

                    "abstract": "Waterflood optimization by means of rate control is receiving considerable attention because of increasing deployments of smart well completions and i-field technology. The use of inflow control valves (ICVs) allows us to optimize the production/injection rates of various segments along the wellbore, thereby maximizing sweep efficiency and delaying water breakthrough. Field-scale rate-optimization problems, however, involve highly complex reservoir models, production and facility constraints, and a large number of unknowns. In this paper, we propose an approach that is computationally efficient and suitable for large field cases. It is based on our previous work (Alhuthali et al. 2007, 2008), which relies on equalizing arrival time of the waterfront at all producers to maximize the sweep efficiency. We use streamlines to efficiently and analytically compute the sensitivity of the arrival times with respect to well rates. We also account for geologic uncertainty by means of a stochastic optimization framework using multiple realizations. Analytical forms for gradients and Hessian of the objective functions are derived, making our optimization computationally efficient for large-scale applications. Finally, optimization is performed under operational and facility constraints using a sequential quadratic programming approach. We demonstrate our approach using two field-scale examples. The first is a synthetic example called \"Brugge\" field, a benchmark case based on a North Sea Brent-type field. The production optimization of this field is carried out as part of a closed-loop process where the production history is matched prior to the production optimization. The production optimization is performed over multiple realizations for 20 years and involves 30 wells equipped with three ICVs per well. The second example is a super-giant Middle Eastern field that has more than 50 years of historical oil production. The optimization is performed for 20 years on a portion of this field that contains nearly 300 wells consisting of conventional vertical and horizontal wells and smart horizontal wells. In both examples, multiple field-related constraints are imposed, such as the maximum well injection and production rates, the maximum allowable drawdown, restriction on high-water-cut wells, and voidage replacement for pressure maintenance. The results clearly demonstrate the viability of our approach and the benefits of optimal rate control, with a considerable increase in cumulative oil production and a substantial decrease in the associated water production.

                    "abstract": "History matching and optimization problems often involve several, potentially conflicting, objectives. For example, we might seek to minimize a misfit function involving differences in reservoir pressure, multiphase production history and 4D time-lapse seismic data and these differences do not always change in tandem. It is a common practice to treat these differences as a single objective optimization problem by aggregating all objectives into a scalar function (weighted-sum), resulting in incomplete exploration of the solution space. The problem is particularly severe if the objectives are conflicting. In this paper we propose to use a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) focusing on finding a set of optimal solutions called Pareto optima. The MOEA makes direct use of the dominance relation for fitness assignment instead of a fitness score in one-dimensional objective space. The dominance concept can define levels of optimality without reduction of objective dimensionality to sort populations accordingly, and the given populations constitute typically several ranks (fronts) of classification for individuals. Because it uses a population of solutions in the search process and optimizes such that the ranks are minimized, the Pareto optima can provide a measure of uncertainty in prediction. We show how the MOEA identifies optimal solutions by examining the trade-off between multiple objectives from a set of plausible solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that it outperforms the commonly used weighted-sum approach. For practical applications, we provide a novel history matching workflow with a grid connectivity-based transformation (GCT) basis coefficients as parameters for calibration using the gradient-free evolutionary optimization algorithms. The basis functions are obtained from a spectral decomposition of the grid connectivity Laplacian and avoid ad hoc redefinitions of regions while preserving the geologic heterogeneity. We demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed workflow using multiple examples. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field application for matching production and seismic data with uncertainty and conflicting information. "

We use experimental design to perform the sensitivity analysis to identify the \"heavy hitters\" and a genetic algorithm (GA) to calibrate the relevant fracture and matrix parameters in shale-gas reservoirs by history matching of production data. In addition to the production data, microseismic information is used to help us constrain the fracture extent and orientation and to estimate the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Gas flow in shale gas reservoirs occurs primarily from ultra low permeability shale rocks through a complex network of natural and induced hydraulic fractures. Consequently, fracture parameters (conductivity and half length), fracture location and distribution are the dominant factors influencing well drainage volumes and shale gas well performance. Stimulated reservoir volume or SRV, estimated from microseismic event clouds or rate/pressure transient analysis, describes a measurement of overall reservoir volume impacted by fracture treatments. With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement.  In this paper, we first introduce a novel approach for computing well drainage volume for shale gas wells with multistage fractures and fracture clusters. Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated. The proposed approach has been applied to a generic shale gas well designed after a real field case. The results clearly indicate the benefits of including SRV during history matching, leading to improved fracture/matrix parameter estimation and performance forecasting. Our proposed approach provides an important tool that can be used to optimize well placement, fracture treatments and improve the economics of shale gas plays.  Introduction The rise in the demand of natural gas globally and the application of more sophisticated production technologies in particular, the creation of multiple hydraulic fractures from horizontal wells (Britt and Smith 2009; Cramer 2008; King 2010) have motivated energy companies to increasingly develop harder-to-access natural gas resources such as tight sands, shale gas and coal bed methane. These unconventional reservoirs with ultra-low permeabilities are known to be more abundant throughout the world and are likely to be the dominant suppliers of future natural gas production (Holditch 2006).

                    "abstract": "Unconventional reservoirs are characterized by sufficiently low permeabilities so that the pressure depletion from a producing well may not propagate far from the well during the life of a development. This is in contrast to conventional plays where the pressure transients may probe the entire reservoir in weeks to months. The concept of depth of investigation and its application to unconventional reservoirs provide the understanding necessary to describe and optimize the interaction between complex multi-stage fractured wells, reservoir heterogeneity, drainage volumes, pressure depletion, well rates, and the estimated ultimate recovery.  Previous studies have performed unconventional reservoir analysis using more conventional reservoir simulation techniques. High resolution local PEBI grids and global corner point grids have been used to represent complex fracture geometry and conductivity and estimate subsequent well performance. However, these techniques do not provide the more geometric understanding provided by the depth of investigation and drainage volumes.  The application of the depth of investigation to heterogeneous reservoirs can be obtained from an asymptotic expansion of the diffusivity equation leading to the Eikonal equation which describes the propagation of the pressure front. This equation is solved using a Fast Marching Method to calculate a diffusive time of flight at every location within the domain. The diffusive time of flight is directly related to pressure front propagation. Unlike in a reservoir simulator, this frontal propagation is determined in a single non-iterative calculation, which is extremely fast. Once the pressure fronts are determined spatially, we may apply a pseudo-steady state pressure approximation within the moving front to determine pressure depletion and well rates.  In the current study, we extend the Fast Marching Method for solution of the Eikonal equation to complex simulation grids including corner point and unstructured grids. This allows the rapid approximation of reservoir simulation results without the need for flow simulation, and also provides the time-evolution of the well drainage volume for visualization. Understanding the drainage volume alone is useful for well spacing and multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. Additional potential applications include well trajectory and hydraulic fracture location optimization, reservoir model screening and ranking, matrix/fracture parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and production data integration.

                    "abstract": "Current industry practice for characterization and assessment of unconventional reservoirs mostly uses empirical decline-curve analysis or analytic rate- and pressure-transient analysis. High-resolution numerical simulation with local perpendicular bisector (PEBI) grids and global corner-point grids has also been used to examine complex nonplanar fracture geometry, interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures, and implications for the well performance. Although the analytic tools require many simplified assumptions, numerical-simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not provide the more-geometric understanding derived from the depth-of-investigation (DOI) and drainage-volume calculations. We propose a novel approach for rapid field-scale performance assessment of shale-gas reservoirs. Our proposed approach is dependent on a high-frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and serves as a bridge between simplified analytical tools and complex numerical simulation. The high-frequency solution leads to the Eikonal equation (Paris and Hurd 1969), which is solved for a “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the “pressure front” in the reservoir. The Eikonal equation can be solved by use of the fast-marching method (FMM) to determine the DTOF, which generalizes the concept of DOI to heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs. It provides an efficient means to calculate drainage volume, pressure depletion, and well performance and can be significantly faster than conventional numerical simulation. More importantly, in a manner analogous to streamline simulation, the DTOF can also be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3D diffusivity equation to a 1D equation, leading to a comprehensive simulator for rapid performance prediction of shale-gas reservoirs. The speed and versatility of our proposed method makes it ideally suited for high-resolution reservoir characterization through integration of static and dynamic data. The major advantages of our proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal, and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power and utility of our method by use of a field example that involves history matching, uncertainty analysis, and performance assessment of a shale-gas reservoir in east Texas. A sensitivity study is first performed to systematically identify the “heavy hitters” affecting the well performance. This is followed by history matching and an uncertainty analysis to identify the fracture parameters and the stimulated-reservoir volume. A comparison of model predictions with the actual well performance shows that our approach is able to reliably predict the pressure depletion and rate decline. "

Introduction Unconventional resources are playing an increasingly important role in energy supply worldwide, especially in the United States. To estimate reservoir properties and optimize hydraulic fracture design in unconventional reservoirs, well test analysis (pressure transient and rate transient analysis) is widely used. In the area of well test analysis (Gringarten 1984, 2010; Ehlig-Economides 1992), the concepts of radius of investigation (Lee 1982; Raghavan 1993) and depth of investigation (Datta-Gupta et al. 2011) are fundamental to estimate reserves, understand drainage volume and identify infill drilling location (Kang et al. 2011). These concepts can also be used in unconventional reservoirs to help planning horizontal well, optimizing multi-stage hydraulic fractures (Sehbi et al. 2011), and understanding stimulated reservoir volume (Yin et al. 2011). Kuchuk (2009) recently summarized several definitions of radius of investigation. Most of them rely on analytical solutions based on homogeneous or layered reservoirs. However, these analytical solutions have limited applicability and are difficult to generalize to arbitrary reservoir conditions and well locations. "

Over the past two decades, advances in computing and the development and implementation of robust algorithms for automatic history matching have considerably reduced the time and effort associated with subsurface characterization and reduced the subjectivity associated with manual model calibration. However, reliable and accurate subsurface characterization continues to be challenging due to the large number of model unknowns to be estimated using a relatively smaller set of measurements. For ensemble-based methods in particular, the difficulties are compounded by the need for a large number of model replicates to estimate sample-based statistical measures, specifically the covariances and cross-covariances that directly impact the spread of information from the measurement locations to the model parameters. Statistical noise resulting from modest ensemble sizes can overwhelm and degrade the model updates leading to geologically inconsistent subsurface models. In this work we propose to address the difficulties in the implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for operational data integration problems. The methods described here use streamline-derived information to identify regions within the reservoir that will have a maximum impact on the dynamic response. This is achieved through spatial localization of the sample-based cross-covariance estimates between the measurements and the model unknowns using streamline trajectories. We illustrate the approach with a synthetic example and a large field-study that demonstrate the difficulties with the traditional EnKF implementation. In both the numerical experiments, it is shown that these challenges are addressed using flow relevant conditioning of the cross-covariance matrix. By mitigating sampling error in the cross-covariance estimates, the proposed approach provides significant computational savings through the use of modest ensemble sizes, and consequently offers the opportunity for use with large field-scale groundwater and reservoir characterization studies.

The pore-size distribution in shale and tight sand reservoirs typically ranges from nanometers to micrometers, resulting in ultralow permeabilities. In such extremely low-permeability reservoirs, desorption and diffusive processes play important roles in addition to heterogeneity-driven convective flows. For modeling shale and tight oil and gas reservoirs, we can compute the well-drainage volume efficiently with a fast marching method (FMM) and by introducing the concept of “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF). Our proposed simulation approach consists of two decoupled steps--drainage-volume calculation and numerical simulation with DTOF as a spatial coordinate. We first calculate the reservoir drainage volume and the DTOF with the FMM, and then the numerical simulation is conducted along the 1D DTOF coordinate. The approach is analogous to streamline modeling whereby a multidimensional simulation is decoupled to a series of 1D simulations resulting in substantial savings in computation time for high-resolution simulation. However, instead of a “convective time of flight” (CTOF), a DTOF is introduced to model the pressure-front propagation. For modeling physical processes, we propose triple continua whereby the reservoir is divided into three different domains: microscale pores (hydraulic fractures and microfractures), nanoscale pores (nanoporous networks), and organic matter. The hydraulic fractures/microfractures primarily contribute to the well production, and are affected by rock compaction. The nanoporous networks contain adsorbed gas molecules, and gas flows into fractures by convection and Knudsen diffusion processes. The organic matter acts as the source of gas. Our simulation approach enables high-resolution flow characterization of unconventional reservoirs because of its efficiency and versatility. We demonstrate the power and utility of our approach with synthetic and field examples. "

No rigorous procedure is available to compute well drainage volumes in the presence of heterogeneity controlled by the distribution and orientation of natural fractures. The situation is complicated by the routine use of complex wells in tight gas reservoirs and the presence of multistage hydraulic fractures. The computation of drainage volume will be critical to our understanding of the interaction between existing wells, potential infill locations and the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) computations. We propose a rigorous approach for well drainage volume calculations in tight gas reservoirs based on the flux field derived from dual porosity finite-difference simulation and demonstrate its application to optimize well placement. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front’ along gas streamlines. The proposed approach is a generalization of the radius of drainage concept in well test analysis (Lee, 1982). The method allows us not only to compute rigorously the well drainage volumes as a function of time but also examine the potential impact of infill wells on the drainage volumes of existing producers. Using these results, we present a systematic approach to optimize well placement to maximize the EUR. We demonstrate the power and utility of our method using both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is used to validate our approach by establishing consistency between the drainage volume calculations from streamlines and the EUR computations based on detailed finite-difference simulations. We also present comparison of our approach with analytic drainage volume calculations for simplified cases. Finally, we present a field example whereby we utilize the streamline-based drainage volumes to identify depleted sands and generate a reservoir ‘depletion capacity’ map to optimize infill well placement based on the undepleted and undrained regions. The field application clearly demonstrates a systematic approach to optimal well placement in tight gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Waterflood optimization via rate control is receiving increased interest because of rapid developments in the smart well completions and i-field technology. The use of inflow control valves (ICV) allows us to optimize the production/injection rates of various segments along the wellbore, thereby maximizing sweep efficiency and delaying water breakthrough. A major challenge for practical field implementation of this technology is dealing with geologic uncertainty. In practice, the reservoir geology is known only in a probabilistic sense; hence, the optimization of smart wells should be carried out in a stochastic framework to account for geologic uncertainty. We propose a practical and efficient approach for computing optimal injection and production rates accounting for geological uncertainty. The approach relies on equalizing arrival time of the waterfront at all producers using multiple geologic realizations. The main objective is to improve sweep efficiency and thereby improve oil production and recovery. We account for geologic uncertainty using two optimization schemes. The first one is to formulate the objective function in a stochastic form which relies on a combination of expected value and standard deviation combined with a risk attitude coefficient. The second one is to minimize the worst case scenario using a min–max problem formulation. The optimization is performed under operational and facility constraints using a sequential quadratic programming approach. A major advantage of our approach is the analytical computation of the gradient and Hessian of the objective function which makes it computationally efficient and suitable for large field cases. Multiple examples are presented to support the robustness and efficiency of the proposed optimization scheme. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field-scale application. The role of geologic uncertainty in the outcome of the optimization is demonstrated both during the early stage and also, the later stages of waterflooding when substantial production history is available.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The placement of infill producers and injectors is an important aspect in the overall development strategy of any field and is particularly challenging for mature fields with high levels of water-cut. Previous screening approaches based upon static reservoir quality maps have limited applicability as these do not account for the drainage and swept volumes from existing wells. In contrast, direct application of formal optimization methods such as evolutionary algorithms and adjoint-based methods to high resolution geologic models may better represent reservoir dynamics but can be complex to implement or computationally prohibitive.  We propose a novel method for well placement optimization that relies on streamlines which represents the flow paths in the reservoir and the time of flight which represents the travel time of fluids along streamlines. Specifically, the streamline time of flight from the injectors provides swept volumes for injectors whereas streamline time of flight from producers gives drainage volumes for producers. These quantities can be effectively combined to a ‘total time of flight' to locate the potential regions of unswept and undrained oil in the reservoir. Our approach utilizes a dynamic measure based on the total streamline time of flight combined with static parameters to identify potential locations for infill drilling. Areas having high value of the dynamic measure (sweet spots) are both poorly drained and poorly swept, making them attractive for drilling infill wells.  We show the power and utility of our proposed method on a mature offshore carbonate field in western India. The simulation model was history matched using a hierarchical history matching approach that follows a sequence of calibrations from global to local parameters in coarsened and fine scales. Using our proposed method on the history matched model we obtained a dynamic measure map highlighting areas suitable for drilling infill wells. Finally, we compared the performance of infill wells located using the dynamic measure map with wells located using traditional well placement techniques, for example, oil saturation map from simulation. Our proposed method consistently outperforms the traditional approaches. Subsequent field infill drilling in the field has validated our approach.  Introduction Placement of infill producers and injectors is an important aspect of the overall development strategy of any field. Well placement optimization becomes particularly important in mature fields where new infill wells have to be drilled based on an improved understanding of the reservoir description and performance. There could be a large number of possible candidate locations for new infill wells. To search through and evaluate all the possible locations is not practically feasible, particularly for high resolution geologic models consisting of multimillion cells. In addition, we must account for geologic uncertainty using multiple plausible realizations while deciding on optimal well placement locations. For large-scale field applications, a practical method is needed to mitigate the computational burden associated with the large number of search locations to minimize the number of simulation runs.

                    "abstract": "3-D streamlines provide an effective tool for reservoir management because of their ability to display reservoir flow and well connections in a physically intuitive manner. Streamlines have been extensively used to investigate the interaction between heterogeneity and well patterns and also for rate allocation and pattern balancing. More recently, streamlines have been used in conjunction with constrained optimization techniques for improving waterflood performance via rate control. Field scale rate optimization problems, however, involve highly complex reservoir models, production and facilities constraints and a large number of unknowns, making them inaccessible for routine waterflood management. In this paper we provide a simple and easy to use workflow for waterflood rate optimization using streamline-based flood efficiency maps that display the flux and time of flight distribution amongst producing wells. We demonstrate the use of flood efficiency map to optimize the injection/production rates to maximize waterflood sweep efficiency by equalizing the average time of flight (TOF) amongst the producing wells in regional basis. Our optimization approach is extremely efficient because it relies on simple analytic calculations to compute weighting factors for injection and production rates to minimize the TOF variance amongst producing wells. Because the approach does not rely on formal and complex optimization tools, it is particularly well-suited for large-scale field application. Also, the approach can be used with both streamline and finite difference simulators. For finite-difference simulations, the streamlines and time of flight are derived from the flux field generated by the simulator. Multiple examples are presented to support the robustness and efficiency of the proposed waterflood management scheme. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field application.

                    "abstract": "Full-field flow simulators use a variety of cell geometries, ranging from simple rectangles to complex corner-point systems. One of the benefits of corner-point cells is the ease with which we may represent faulted reservoirs. Each face of a cell may be juxtaposed to two or more cells, depending on the fault throw and the lateral displacements of adjacent cells. Conventional finite-difference approaches routinely include the flux between these cells as \"non-neighbor\" connections. Other examples of non-neighbor or nonstandard connections occur at the boundary of local grid refinement (LGR) or local grid coarsening (LGC) regions where two computational grids come into juxtaposition. In each of these instances, the velocity across the nonstandard faces of a cell will be unevenly distributed according to the non-neighbor fluxes. In contrast, the standard streamline velocity interpolation model (Pollock's scheme) used within a cell assumes that the flux is evenly distributed on each cell face, inconsistent with the non-neighbor connection fluxes. Streamlines traced with such an approach do not have sufficient degrees of freedom to be consistent with the finite-difference fluxes and, consequently, will not follow a physical flow path. We propose a strategy that provides a consistent representation for streamlines and velocities near faults and non-neighbor connections. Our approach is based on a simple local (boundary layer) refinement construction that can be used to honor the fluxes at each face, without affecting the representation of flow within the cell or on any other cell face. The local refinement construction is the simplest extension to three dimensions for faulted reservoir cells that provides consistency with the finite difference flux calculation. Several examples will be presented for a single pair of cells juxtaposed across a fault and at LGR boundaries to illustrate the difficulties in conventional tracing algorithms and the benefits of our approach. The practical utility of our algorithm is demonstrated in a structurally complex and heavily faulted full-field model. The reservoir geometry includes multiple cells with complex fault juxtaposition and several non-neighbor configurations in different faces. This treatment is contrasted with the usual approach, and the implications for reservoir scale fluid flow tracing by streamlines is examined "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Horizontal well technology is now considered a standard completion practice in unconventional gas reservoirs. With significant improvements in the drilling and completion technology, many tight gas and shale gas prospects have become economically viable. Optimizing location, distribution and the number of stages of hydraulic fractures is an important issue in tight gas reservoir completions, particularly for horizontal and complex wells.  The paper presents a fast approach to optimizing well completions in tight gas reservoirs using a rigorous semi-analytic computation of well drainage volumes in the presence of multiple stages of hydraulic fractures. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front' in the reservoir along gas streamlines. The proposed approach is a generalization of the radius of drainage concept in well test analysis (Lee, 1982). The streamlines are computed from the pressure and velocity distribution derived from finite difference simulation. This makes the approach completely general and capable of handling complex spatial reservoir heterogeneity and arbitrary well conditions. Furthermore, the streamline approach is visual, intuitive and allows us to examine the interactions between the hydraulic fractures, reservoir heterogeneity and the implications on the drainage volumes and EUR calculations.  A field example is presented to demonstrate the application of our approach by optimizing well completions in a horizontal well recently drilled in the Cotton Valley formation. We first apply the proposed drainage volume calculations to an existing vertical well and identify its ‘region of influence' along with the potential interference from the proposed horizontal well. We then apply the drainage volume concept to the proposed horizontal well and examine the effects of different number of hydraulic fracture stages. The combined drainage volumes from the vertical and horizontal well are calculated as a function of the number of fracture stages to determine the point of diminishing return and to optimize the number of fracture stages. The results are found to be consistent with independent analysis based on rate profiles from numerical simulation and NPV calculations.  Introduction Hydraulic fracture treatment and horizontal well drilling technologies have become an integral part of the exploitation and development of tight gas reservoirs. These enabling technologies have spurred the development of unconventional resource base mainly consisting of tight gas sands, coal bed methane and shale gas. Hydraulic fracturing technology has evolved tremendously in the last decade in North America as a result of synergies derived from various functional and cross-functional groups. Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing treatments and other fracture diagnostic methods have enabled greater understanding of the nature of the formation being stimulated. As a result, a greater portion of the ‘Resource triangle' for natural gas is now being accessed and the ‘Resource' base is being converted by consistent application of these technologies to ‘Reserves' (Holditch and Madani, 2010).

                    "abstract": "History matching problems are typically underdetermined and are at once confronted with the problems of solution non-uniqueness, instability, and the ability to both reproduce field observations and provide a reliable forecast. We address these challenges with a new adaptive multiscale history matching formulation that parameterizes the reservoir properties in the frequency domain. The geologic model updating is carried out by successively increasing the level of detail up to a spatial scale sufficient to match the observed data. Our method begins by constructing a coarse representation of the field using the lowest-frequency components of its discrete cosine parameterization. This substantially reduces the number of unknown parameters to be resolved during history matching, leading to a better posed inverse problem. A gradient-based minimization is then performed to match the production data. Next, the updated model is incrementally refined in the frequency domain and the minimization is repeated until the data misfit is reduced below a pre-specified criterion or until no further improvements are observed. During minimization, components of the gradient insensitive to production information are removed by a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), facilitating iterative convergence and providing additional regularization. In this manner a balance is achieved between parameter reduction which is required for stability, and the spatial resolution of heterogeneity required for reproduction of the production history. The low-frequency approximation of the permeability field helps to honor geologic continuity and is particularly suited for resolving the large-scale heterogeneity that has a dominant influence on the field-scale flow regime and production response. Applications of the approach are demonstrated using the SPE10 and PUNQ-S3 models and involve waterflood history matching with water-cut and bottom-hole pressure data. Our results show that the principle geologic features of the reference field are adequately resolved only if we begin at low resolution. As the resolution is iteratively increased, the history match is improved while the TSVD step removes insensitive parameter combinations thereby decreasing the likelihood of convergence to less plausible local minima. Notably, in all our applications an adequate history match is achieved using less than 1% of the original parameter dimension, which leads to increased solution stability and computational savings in history matching large geologic models.

Our approach can fully account for complex fracture network geometries associated with multistage hydraulic fractures and their impact on the well pressure and rates. The major advantages of our proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal and computational efficiency. For example, we can compute and visualize the time evolution of the well drainage volume for multimillion cell geologic models in seconds without resorting to reservoir simulation. A geometric approximation of the drainage volume is then used to compute the well rates and the reservoir pressure. The speed and versatility of our proposed approach makes it ideally suited for parameter estimation via inverse modeling of shale gas performance data. We utilize experimental design to perform the sensitivity analysis to identify the ‘heavy hitters' and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the relevant fracture and matrix parameters in shale gas reservoirs by history matching of production data. In addition to the production data, microseismic information is utilized to help us constrain the fracture extent and orientation and to estimate the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The proposed approach is applied to a fractured shale gas well. The results clearly show reduced uncertainty in the estimated fracture parameters and SRV, leading to improved forecasting and reserve estimation. Introduction Shale gas production has become an important share of U.S. energy supply, driven to a large extent by the advances in horizontal well completion technology and multistage hydraulic fracturing. To reliably estimate shale gas reserves and ultimate recoveries, it is important to predict shale gas well performance accounting for the relevant reservoir and fracture parameters. Currently decline curve analysis (Fetkovich 1980; Valko and Lee 2010) and pressure/rate transient analysis (Ilk et al. 2010; Song and Ehlig-Economides 2011; Clarkson et al. 2012) are two types of widely used analytical methods for production forecasting in shale gas well development. The methods in decline curve analysis are largely curve-fitting used to forecast production via extrapolation and obtain the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). In pressure/rate transient analysis, fracture properties are first estimated from identified flow regimes and then well production is predicted with the estimated properties. "

                    "abstract": "Understanding how pressure fronts propagate (diffuse) in a reservoir formation is fundamental to welltest analysis and reservoir drainage volume estimation. We have developed an alternative approach to the solution of the 3-D diffusivity equation by directly solving the propagation equation for the \"pressure front\" defined as the maximum pressure response for an impulse source. The pressure front equation is a form of the Eikonal equation, which is a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and whose properties are well developed in the literature. Most importantly, the Eikonal equation can be solved very efficiently by a class of solutions called the Fast Marching Methods (FMM) for a \"diffusive time of flight\" (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the \"pressure front\" in the reservoir. The \"diffusive time of flight\" can be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3-D diffusivity equation into an equivalent 1-D formulation, leading to a simplified method for rapid reservoir modeling. Recent papers have explored the utility of this 1-D approach for performance prediction using finite difference numerical simulation. The method is especially well suited to the interpretation of the drainage volume, which is of great help in well spacing calculations and in the context of unconventional reservoirs, multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. In this paper we introduce an analytic solution technique for the diffusivity equation, which provides a direct relationship between production data and the reservoir drainage volume. The analytic formulation provides for the direct calculation and extension of many simple well test, rate transient and well performance concepts such as depth of investigation, welltest derivative, drainage volume, flow regimes and well productivity. As with other analytic approaches, these solutions allow superposition in space and in time, which allows for the solution for multiple wells, multiple flow rates, and bounded and composite reservoirs. We validate our approach against well-known solutions in pressure and rate transient analysis usually solved in Laplace space, including pressure transients with wellbore storage and skin. Our study demonstrates that the new approach yields results very close to the known solutions calculated via numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, and indicates how to extend these solutions to problems with heterogeneity and complex fractured well geometry.

                    "abstract": "Abstract We present a method for history matching and uncertainty quantification for channelized reservoir models using Level Set Method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our objective is to efficiently sample realizations of the channelized permeability fields conditioned to the production data and facies observation at the wells. In our approach, the channel field boundary is first described by a level set function, e.g., a signed distance function or any other indicator function. By solving the level set equation (motion in a prescribed direction), we are able to gradually move the channel boundaries and evolve the channelized reservoir properties. Our approach allows representing facies via a parameterization of the velocity field that deforms the interface. Thus facies can be parameterized in the space of smooth velocity fields. The dimension reduction can be achieved for covariance-based velocity fields by re-parameterizing with SVD techniques.  After parameterization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is utilized to perturb the coefficients of principal components of velocity field to update channel reservoir model matching production history. One advantage of this approach is that it is easy to condition the channel model to the facies observations at well locations by constraining the random velocity field to zero at well locations. To speed up the computation and improve the acceptance rate of the MCMC algorithm, we employ two stage methods where coarse-scale simulations are used to screen out the undesired proposals. The MCMC algorithms naturally provide multiple realizations of the permeability field conditioned to well and production data and thus, allow for uncertainty assessment in the forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the level set MCMC algorithm using both 2D and 3D examples involving waterflood history matching.  Introduction In many geologic environments, the distribution of subsurface properties is primarily controlled by the location and distribution of distinct geologic facies with sharp contrasts in properties across facies boundaries (Weber, 1982). For example in a fluvial setting, high permeability channel sands are often embedded in a nearly impermeable background causing the dominant fluid movement to be restricted within these channels. Under such conditions, the orientation of the channels and channel geometry play an important role in determining the flow behavior in the subsurface. Thus, in predicting the flow through highly heterogeneous porous formations, it is important to model facies boundaries accurately and to properly account for the uncertainties in these models.  The representation and history matching of channelized reservoirs are challenging because of the difficulties to reproduce the large-scale continuity of the channel structure and identify the channel geometry and its orientation. The traditional twopoint geostatistical techniques for reservoir characterization are unable to reproduce the channel geometry and the facies architecture (Dubrule, 1998; Haldorsen and Damsleth, 1990; Koltermann and Gorelick, 1996). As an alternative, object-based modeling (Deutsch and Wang, 1996) and more recently, multi-point geostatistical methods (Caers and Zhang, 2004; Strebelle and Journel, 2001) have been used to represent the channel structure for dynamic data history matching. The object-based modeling is dependent on the parameters to specify the object size, shape, and orientation. The method is usually limited to simple channel geometry and it can be difficult to condition the generated objects to dynamic production data and well observations. The multi-point geostatistical methods use training images to generate geologic realizations conditioned to the well observations. However, the success of the multi-point geostatistical methods depends on the appropriate selection of the training image. Pixel-based approach, such as discrete cosine transform has been applied to re-parameterize channelized reservoirs for history matching (Jafarpour and McLaughlin, 2009; Xie et al., 2010).

                    "abstract": "Inverse problems associated with reservoir characterization are typically under-determined and often have difficulties associated with stability and convergence of the solution. A common approach to address this issue is through the introduction of prior norm constraints, smoothness regularization or reparameterization to reduce the number of estimated parameters. We propose a dual scale approach to production data integration that relies on a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale inversions while preserving the essential features of the geologic model. To begin with, we sequentially coarsen the fine-scale geological model by grouping layers in such a way that the heterogeneity measure of an appropriately defined ‘static’ property is minimized within the layers and maximized between the layers. Our coarsening algorithm results in a non-uniform coarsening of the geologic model with minimal loss of heterogeneity and the ‘optimal’ number of layers is determined based on a bias-variance trade-off criterion. The coarse-scale model is then updated using production data via a generalized travel time inversion. The coarse-scale inversion proceeds much faster compared to a direct fine-scale inversion because of the significantly reduced parameter space. Furthermore, the iterative minimization is much more effective because at the larger scales there are fewer local minima and those tend to be farther apart. At the end of the coarse-scale inversion, a fine-scale inversion may be carried out, if needed. This constitutes the outer iteration in the overall algorithm. The fine-scale inversion is carried out only if the data misfit is deemed to be unsatisfactory. We demonstrate our approach using both synthetic and field examples. The field example involves waterflood history matching of a structurally complex and faulted offshore turbiditic oil reservoir. Permeability and fault transmissibilities are the main uncertainties. The geologic model consists of more than 800,000 cells and 10 years of production data from 8 producing wells. Using our dual scale approach, we are able to obtain a satisfactory history match with a finite-difference model in less than a day in a PC. Compared to a manual history matching, the dual scale approach is shown to better preserve the geological features and the pay/non-pay juxtapositions in the original geologic model. "

Consequently, fracture parameters (conductivity and half length), fracture location and distribution are the dominant factors influencing well drainage volumes and shale gas well performance. Stimulated reservoir volume or SRV, estimated from microseismic event clouds or rate/pressure transient analysis, describes a measurement of overall reservoir volume impacted by fracture treatments. With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement.

Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated. The proposed approach has been applied to a generic shale gas well designed after a real field case. The results clearly indicate the benefits of including SRV during history matching, leading to improved fracture/matrix parameter estimation and performance forecasting.

To start with, the permeability field is parameterized using a novel grid-connectivity-based transformation basis that can be applied with any model geometry, including unstructured and corner-point grids. The parameterization basis functions emerge from spectral decomposition of the grid-connectivity Laplacian and are related to the structural harmonics of the grid. To reconcile data with model resolution during history matching, we first use the coarsest-scale basis functions to identify the large-scale variability. Additional smaller-scale basis elements are then adaptively incorporated to successively refine the model to a level supported by data resolution. During refinement, the inclusion of more detailed basis functions into the parameterization is determined by generic modal frequency when the prior model is unavailable or by using prior information when available. In the final step of the workflow, a streamline-based inversion is performed to locally adjust the reservoir model at grid-cell resolution along preferential-flow paths defined during the coarser-scale parameterization. We demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the developed workflow through application to an offshore turbidite reservoir with frequent well intervention, including shut-ins and recompletions. The static model has over 300,000 cells, a complex channelized interpretation with faults, four injector/producer pairs with deviated wells, and over eight years of production history, including water cut and pressure data.

In this paper, a series of synthetic cases are used to evaluate the well performance under different refracturing designs. The key characteristics for refracturing simulation is accurate quantification of the depletion-induced stress and pressure field change. Thus, finite element method is used to solve the coupled reservoir flow and geomechanics model while a cohesive zone model is adopted to simulate the fracture propagation. A viscoelastic model is used to simulate the time-dependent fracture conductivity change due to proppant embedment. The synthetic cases are grouped into two categories: refracturing in existing perforations and in newly created perforations. A systematic sensitivity study is performed on the effects of fracturing spacing, matrix permeability and refracturing time. Numerical results show different fracture configurations for refracturing in depleted and virgin reservoirs and thus demonstrate the importance of accounting for stress and pressure changes during initial production. Refracturing the existing perforation is likely to create a wider but shorter fracture compared to the virgin case because the fracturing fluid in these fractures encounter less resistance for enlarging fracture width rather than fracture length because of reduced pressure and total stress. Refracturing new perforations appears to give better short-term performance than refracturing existing perforations but worse long-term performance. Simulation results indicate that for relatively low permeability reservoir it is favorable to add more fracture area; however, the advantage is diminished while for relatively high permeability reservoir where the SRV might already be depleted. When proppant degradation is severe, and fracture conductivity is the limiting factor for production, refracturing existing perforations becomes more attractive. Moreover, simulation results seem to indicate an optimum time window exists for refracturing in this scenario. "

                    "abstract": "Downhole-temperature measurement is one of the solutions to understanding downhole-flow conditions, especially in complex well/reservoir domains such as multistage-fractured horizontal wells. In the past, models and methodologies have been developed for fracture diagnosis for multiple-stage-fractured horizontal wells. They are based either on a semianalytical approach for simplicity or on reservoir simulation for generality. The challenges are that semianalytical models are not robust enough to describe complex fracture systems, whereas numerical simulation is computationally expensive and impractical for inversion. To develop a comprehensive approach to translate temperature to flow profile, we adopted the fast marching method (FMM) in simulating both heat transfer and the velocity/pressure field in the interested domain (heterogeneous reservoir with multiple-fractured horizontal wells). FMM is a new approach that is efficient in front tracking. Previous studies show a significant success in the investigation of pressure-depletion behavior and shale-gas production-history match. By the nature of heat transfer in porous media, the thermal-front propagation would lag behind pressure, and the noticeable temperature change in the reservoir only happens near hydraulic/natural fractures. FMM can be used to efficiently track the heat front that is associated with the flow field. In this study, we solve the thermal model in porous media by transforming the general energy-balance equation into a 1D equation, with the diffusive time of flight (DTOF) as the spatial coordinate system. Besides the diffusive heat conduction, the convection, Joule-Thomson effect, and viscous dissipation are considered in the model. The inner boundary of the model is carefully handled, and the drainage volume of each fracture is calculated to identify different inflow temperature related to flow rate at perforation locations. The model was validated by the finite-difference approach. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the application of the new method. The approach can be used to quantitatively interpret temperature measurements to fracture profiles in horizontal wells. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We present the development and field application of a workflow for multiscale reservoir model calibration that seamlessly integrates production data into reservoir description from the facies to the grid-cell scale. To start with, the permeability field is parameterized using a novel grid-connectivity-based transformation basis that can be applied with any model geometry including unstructured and corner-point grids. The parameterization basis functions emerge from spectral decomposition of the grid-connectivity Laplacian and are related to the structural harmonics of the grid. To reconcile data with model resolution during history matching, we first use the coarsest scale basis functions to identify the large scale variability. Additional smaller-scale basis elements are then adaptively incorporated to successively refine the model to a level supported by data resolution. During refinement, the inclusion of more detailed basis functions into the parameterization is determined by generic modal frequency when the prior model is unavailable, or using prior information when available. In the final step of the workflow a streamline-based inversion is performed to locally adjust the reservoir model at grid-cell resolution along coarse scale preferential flow paths defined during the previous step using the parameterization.  We demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the developed workflow through application to an offshore turbidite reservoir with frequent well intervention including shut-ins and recompletions. The static model has over three-hundred thousand cells, a complex channelized interpretation with faults, four injector-producer pairs with deviated wells and over eight years of production history including water-cut and pressure data. The grid connectivity-based parameterization effectively updates the prior regional permeability at scales and in locations warranted by the data, while preserving the geologic continuity and avoiding ad hoc redefinition of regions given the sparse well pattern. The multiscale calibrated permeability field indicates flow communication previously unrecognized in static geologic interpretation or manual history matching.  Introduction Reservoir model calibration to dynamic data, also known as history matching, is an essential tool for the prediction of fluid displacement patterns and related decisions concerning reservoir management and field development. History matching is performed to characterize subsurface heterogeneity that dominates the spatial and temporal variability in displacement behavior according to the existing well pattern and schedule. To account for the disparity in resolution of various types of dynamic measurements available, from seismic down to the core, data integration algorithms must follow suit in their ability to identify and update reservoir heterogeneity over a wide range of spatial scales in a manner consistent with data resolution.  Characterization of reservoir heterogeneity typically begins with the conceptual geologic model and the identification of regional attributes such as facies or depositional sequences, domain boundaries and boundary conditions, and faults or other sources of regional hydraulic (dis)continuity. Finer-scale patterns of heterogeneity within regional features may then be populated and updated when appropriate. Accordingly, research and field application together have emphasized the establishment of reservoir engineering workflows that systematically reconcile the geologic model, from the regional to gridcell scale, with multiresolution static and dynamic data. Related approaches to both manual and assisted history matching typically apply a structured approach and employ a series of data integration algorithms that are each suited to the scale of the estimated features and the type and resolution of the available data (Landa and Horne, 1997; Williams et al., 2004; Caers, 2003; Yin et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2008). Approaches following this parsimonious rationale integrate data such as 3D/4D seismic, formation testing of pressure, pressure transient analysis and production phase cuts in a step-wise sequence, beginning at the global scale and often with the most simple description, followed by an attempt to update finer-scale details only when supported by the data or by related reservoir management decisions.

                    "abstract": "History matching problems are typically underdetermined and can have problems with uniqueness and stability of the solution and preserving geologic realism which is critical for a reliable forecast of not only future production but also the distribution of bypassed hydrocarbon in the reservoir. We propose a new adaptive multi-stage history matching formulation that parameterizes the reservoir properties in the frequency domain where the geologic model updating is carried out by successively increasing the level of detail up to a spatial scale sufficient to match the observed data. The method begins by constructing a coarse representation of the field using the lowest-frequency components of its discrete cosine parameterization. This substantially reduces the number of unknown parameters to be resolved during history matching. A gradient-based minimization is then performed to match the production data. Next, the updated model is incrementally refined in the frequency domain and the minimization is repeated until the data misfit is reduced below a pre-specified criterion. During minimization, components of the gradient insensitive to production information are removed by truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), facilitating iterative convergence and providing additional regularization. In this manner a balance is achieved between parameter reduction which is required for stability, and the spatial resolution of heterogeneity required for reproduction of the data. The low-frequency approximation of the field helps to honor geologic continuity and is particularly suited for resolving the large-scale heterogeneity that has a dominant influence on the production response. Applications of the approach are demonstrated using the SPE10 and PUNQ-S3 models and involve waterflood history matching with water-cut and bottom-hole pressure data. Our results show that the principle geologic features of the reference field are adequately resolved only if we begin at very low resolution. As the resolution is iteratively increased, the history match is improved while the TSVD step automatically removes insensitive parameter combinations that can result in convergence to a local minimum. Notably, in all our applications an adequate history match is achieved using less than one percent of the original parameter dimension, which leads to increased solution stability and computational savings in history matching large geologic models. Introduction The history matching of geologic models is an important step in the development of field operation strategies and production forecasting. It is well known that the integration of observed data into a reservoir model involves a highly underdetermined and ill-posed inverse problem that results in non-unique and potentially unstable solutions. The solution or updated reservoir model must also cohere with multiple types of data consisting of static, dynamic and more qualitative geologic descriptions so that geologic consistency is maintained during model updating. Further, when applying an iterative descent method with an under-determined problem, it is likely for the solution to be trapped in one of the many local minima. "

                    "abstract": "We present an efficient history matching approach that simultaneously integrates 4-D repeat seismic surveys with well production data. This approach is particularly well-suited for the calibration of the reservoir properties of high-resolution geologic models because the seismic data is areally dense but sparse in time, while the production data is continuous in time but averaged over interwell spacing. The joint history matching is performed using streamline-based sensitivities derived from either finite-difference or streamline-based flow simulation. Previous approaches to seismic data integration have mostly incorporated saturation effects but the pressure effects have largely been ignored. We propose, for the first time, streamline-based analytic approaches to compute parameter sensitivities that relate the seismic data to reservoir properties while accounting for both pressure and saturation effects via appropriate rock physics models. The inverted seismic data (e.g., changes in acoustic impedance or fluid saturations), is distributed as a 3-D high-resolution grid cell property or as a vertically integrated two-dimensional map. We derive pressure drop sensitivities along streamlines in addition to our previous work of water saturation sensitivity computation. The novelty of the method lies in the analytic sensitivity computations which make it computationally efficient for high resolution geologic models. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing it in a finite difference simulator which incorporates detailed physical processes, while the streamline trajectories provide for rapid evaluation of the sensitivities. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated with both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is the SPE benchmark Brugge field case. The field example involves waterflooding of a North Sea reservoir with multiple seismic surveys. For both the synthetic and the field cases, the advantages of incorporating the time-lapse variations are clearly demonstrated through improved estimation of the permeability distribution, pressure profile, and fluid saturation evolution and swept volumes.

                    "abstract": "Streamlines have been very effectively used for computing swept volumes and drainage volumes in oil reservoirs. However, there is an incorrect but commonly held perception that streamlines cannot be used for gas reservoirs. In fact, streamlines exist whenever there is an underlying velocity field—both in compressible and incompressible flow. In this paper we present one of the first applications of streamlines to tight gas reservoirs for drainage volume calculations of producing wells, optimal placement of infill wells. Current practice of well placement in tight gas reservoirs generally involves the use of empirical correlations based on reservoir properties and past production histories and/or pressure maps from flow simulation. No rigorous procedure is available to compute well drainage volumes in the presence of heterogeneity and hydraulic fractures, particularly for complex wells. We propose a fast approach for drainage volume calculations based on the streamlines and diffusive time of flight and demonstrate its application to optimize well placement. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front’ in the reservoir. This allows us not only to rigorously compute the well drainage volumes as a function of time, but also to examine the potential impact of infill wells on the drainage volumes of existing producers. Using these results, we present a systematic approach to optimize well placement to maximize the estimated ultimate recoveries (EUR). We demonstrate the power and utility of our method using both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is used to validate our approach by establishing the consistency between the drainage volume calculations from streamlines and the EUR. The field example is from the Wamsutter gas field, one of the largest gas fields in the Rocky Mountain region. We utilize the streamline-based drainage volumes to identify depleted sands and generate a reservoir quality map to optimize future well placement based on the undepleted regions. Field application clearly demonstrates a systematic and efficient approach to optimal well placement in tight gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has gained increased popularity for history matching and continuous reservoir-model updating. It is a sequential Monte Carlo approach that works with an ensemble of reservoir models. Specifically, the method uses cross covariance between measurements and model parameters estimated from the ensemble. For practical field applications, the ensemble size needs to be kept small for computational efficiency. However, this leads to poor approximations of the cross covariance and can cause loss of geologic realism from unrealistic model updates outside the region of the data influence and/or loss of variance leading to ensemble collapse. A common approach to remedy the situation is to limit the influence of the data through covariance localization. In this paper, we show that for three-phase-flow conditions, the region of covariance localization strongly depends on the underlying flow dynamics as well as on the particular data type that is being assimilated in terms of water cut or gas/oil ratio (GOR). This makes the traditional distance-based localizations suboptimal and, often, ineffective. Instead, we propose the use of water- and gas-phase streamlines as a means for covariance localization for water-cut- and GOR-data assimilation. The phase streamlines can be computed on the basis of individual-phase velocities which are readily available after flow simulation. Unlike the total streamlines, phase streamlines can be discontinuous. We show that the discontinuities in water-phase and gas-phase streamlines naturally define the region of influence for water-cut and GOR data and provide a flow-relevant covariance localization during EnKF updating. We first demonstrate the validity of the proposed localization approach using a waterflood example in a quarter-five-spot pattern. Specifically, we compare the phase streamline trajectories with cross-covariance maps computed using an ensemble size of 2,000 for both water-cut and GOR data. The results show a close correspondence between the time evolution of phase streamlines and the cross-covariance maps of water-cut and GOR data. A small-size industrial reservoir engineering production forecasting with uncertainty quantification (the PUNQ-S3) (Carter 2007) model application shows that our proposed localization outperforms a distance-based localization method. The updated models show improved forecasts while preserving geological realism. "

                    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the novelty and practical feasibility of the FMM-based multi-phase simulation for rapid field-scale modeling of shale reservoirs with multi-continua heterogeneity. Modeling of unconventional reservoirs requires accurate characterization of complex flow mechanisms in multi-continua because of the interactions between reservoir rocks, microfractures and hydraulic fractures. It is also essential to account for the complicated geometry of well completion, the reservoir heterogeneity and multi-phase flow effects. Currently, such multi-phase numerical simulation for multi-continua reservoirs needs substantial computational time that hinders efficient history matching and uncertainty analysis. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for field scale application and performance assessment of shale reservoirs using rapid multi-phase simulation with the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The key idea of the reservoir simulation using the FMM is to recast the 3-D flow equation into 1-D equation along the ‘diffusive time of flight’ (DTOF) coordinate, which embeds the 3-D spatial heterogeneity. The DTOF is a representation of the travel time of pressure propagation in the reservoir. The pressure propagation is governed by the Eikonal equation which can be solved efficiently using the FMM. The 1-D formulation leads to orders of magnitude faster computation than the 3-D finite difference simulation. The use of FMM-based simulation also enables systematic history matching and uncertainty analysis using population-based techniques that require substantial simulation runs. We first validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the FMM-based multi-phase simulation using synthetic reservoir models and comparison with a commercial finite-difference simulator. Next, we apply our proposed approach to a field example in Texas for a multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal well. The 3-D heterogeneous reservoir model was built and history matched for oil, gas and water production using the Genetic Algorithm with the FMM-based flow simulation. Multiple history-matched models were obtained to examine uncertainties in the production forecast associated with respect to the properties related to hydraulic fractures, microfractures and the matrix.

Parameter updates are constrained to the prior geologic heterogeneity and are performed parsimoniously, or only to spatial scales that can be resolved by the historical data. In the first step of the workflow, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to calibrate and assess the uncertainty in global parameters (e.g., regional fracture properties, aquifer strength) that influence reservoir energy and field-scale flow behavior. To identify the reservoir volume over which each parameter region is applied, a novel heterogeneity segmentation technique is developed from spectral clustering theory. After an ensemble of calibrated model realizations is identified using the GA, the ensemble is reduced via a cluster analysis to define a variance-preserving subset of the members for the second step of local, higher-resolution parameter calibration. Each member of the subset is calibrated to well-level phase rate and pressure data using a sensitivity-based scheme. To improve the ill-posedness of each high-resolution inverse problem, the heterogeneity field is parameterized in the spectral domain using the Grid Connectivity-based Transform (GCT) to provide a compressed representation that captures only the sensitive geologic trends. The GCT concurrently imposes geological continuity during calibration and promotes minimal changes to each prior ensemble member. The proposed calibration workflow is applied to a structurally complex, fractured reservoir located offshore Peru. The reservoir is modeled as dual porosity and single permeability (DPSP). In the global calibration step, the field water production rates, gas rates and average reservoir pressure are matched using the GA together with zonal multipliers that represent spatial variation in aquifer strength, fracture porosity and a matrix–fracture coupling parameter. In the subsequent local step, the well-by-well production histories are matched through calibration of the most uncertain grid-cell parameter, fracture permeability, which is characterized using the GCT parameterization. The final calibrated models are consistent with geologic interpretation and are currently being applied for field development strategies. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The effects of heterogeneity in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in saline aquifers have been investigated extensively and are known to have important bearings on the storage capacity of the aquifer. In CCS projects, the time-lapse seismic survey has been proposed as a valuable tool for monitoring of CO2 movement. However, the potential of the time-lapse seismic data for heterogeneity characterization and geologic model updating has not been fully explored. One of the biggest challenges in the quantitative use of time-lapse seismic data during CCS is the complex movement of the CO2 influenced by compositional effects, geochemical reactions, phase changes and gravity segregation.  In this paper, we first introduce compositional streamlines to understand and visualize the flow and transport of CO2 in the presence of mineral precipitation/dissolution, residual trapping and buoyancy effects. To start with, individual component fluxes are generated by a finite difference fully implicit compositional simulator incorporating all the relevant physics of CO2 sequestration. The fluxes are then utilized in novel streamline tracing algorithms to generate phase and component streamlines depicting the movement and the trapping of CO2 in the aquifer. Next, we utilize the compositional streamlines to determine the sensitivity of the time-lapse seismic attributes specifically, interpreted saturation differences, to changes in reservoir properties such as permeability and porosity. The sensitivities are then used in an inverse modeling algorithm to calibrate the geologic model to time-lapse seismic data. The outcome is an improved description of permeability heterogeneity that is consistent with the 4-D seismic response and improved predictions of the CO2 storage capacity.  We have investigated the benefits of time-lapse seismic data integration in improving the performance assessment of CO2 sequestration using examples involving CO2 injection under realistic conditions. The first example examines the value of the 4-D seismic data integration in the estimation of storage capacity. The second example systematically studies the impact of viscous to gravity ratio on the performance of time-lapse seismic monitoring and heterogeneity characterization during CCS.  Introduction Carbon sequestration in brine aquifers faces many different challenges in both engineering and economical aspects. There are several sources of uncertainties associated with the injection of CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Engineering problems such as the leakage of CO2 can compromise the integrity of fresh waters, ecosystems and the health of populations exposed to high concentration of CO2 (Ha-Duong, 2003; Gasda et al., 2004). There are also economic threats associated with legal disputes and fines imposed by regulatory agencies.  Monitoring, verification and accounting (MVA) are the activities directed to determine the location of the injected CO2 and the presence of possible leaks in order to provide public assurance. Many techniques have been developed for monitoring the performance of CO2 injection projects and the migration of CO2 in geologic formations. Time lapse seismic surveillance data is one of the most mature and effective techniques for monitoring changes in the fluid saturation and pressure and has been extensively used by the oil industry.  The viability of time lapse seismic data as a monitoring tool has been investigated in laboratory and field experiments (Wang and Nur 1989; Wang et al 1998; Korneev et al 2004; Hovorka et al 2006; Daley et al 2007). The characteristics of seismic responses under the complex compositional and geochemical interactions of the injected CO2 in geologic formations have been modeled by Kumar et al. (2008). Also, the effectiveness of traditional rock physics models to invert the seismic responses into changes in the acoustic impedance of the rock during CO2 sequestration has been investigated by Vanorio et al. (2010). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Flow simulation of multimillion grid cell models with hundreds of wells and decades long production history can be extremely time-consuming. This often limits the applicability of assisted history matching techniques. A pragmatic solution to this problem is grid coarsening which is now embedded in many commercial reservoir simulators.  Instead of up-scaling geological models in external packages, grid cells are automatically amalgamated within the simulator while preserving flux distribution and reducing the total number of active cells. The resulting speedup can be significant, often only at small loss of accuracy. Both characteristics are essential elements of any inversion technique in a multimillion grid cell environment. For water-flood history matching, we have utilized a commercial finite-volume simulator and the streamline-based generalized travel time inversion whereby water-cut behavior is matched by adjusting inter-well permeabilities.  To apply the assisted history matching technique on high resolution models, a flux reconstruction method is devised which makes full use of the benefits of automatic grid coarsening. It approximates fluxes in the original geological grid by recalculating transmissibility at the fine scale and redistributing coarse scale fluxes accordingly. The inversion is thus conducted on the fine scale grid, while the forward simulation model uses the coarse grid. While solving for an inexpensive coarse model, the calibration takes into account fine grid resolution. Upscaling is not required and the degree of coarsening can be adjusted during the matching process.  The proposed method was successfully tested on a supergiant carbonate oilfield with about hundred wells and large-scale water injection. The history match improved dramatically at relatively low numerical cost, which also allowed for investigating multiple sensitivities. The results were verified against non-coarsened model. The significant increase in efficiency makes this a potential method of choice for cases, where previously assisted history matching techniques could not be deployed due to excessive run times.  Introduction Multimillion grid cell models are frequently used in reservoir simulation. But these models, which very often have a significant number of wells and decades long production history, pose the problem of long simulation run times. The complexity of such models result in a large number of model parameters which is not only related to the problem of non uniqueness but also to the significant computational expense of deriving sensitivities of model parameters to production response which is a prerequisite in any optimization technique (Stenerud et al. ,2008).  To evaluate sensitivities of global parameters, coarsened or upscaled simulation models can be useful as they can significantly reduce simulation runtimes which is vital for deriving efficient parameter sensitivities (Mamanov et al., 2007; Jong et al., 2010). They are also more suitable than proxy response surfaces constructed using experimental design techniques as they are directly derived from the non-coarsened or non upscaled simulation input models. In our convention, simulation model running with grid coarsening will be referred to as coarsened models and normal simulation model will be referred to as non-coarsened model. "

The FMM is a recently introduced method that relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation to extend the concept of depth of investigation to heterogeneous and fractured media. The approach has been shown to be computationally efficient, physically intuitive and can rigorously account for the interactions between the hydraulic and natural fractures during the computation of drainage volume. Our optimization approach will attempt to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) from the engineering perspective, by selecting the optimal number and placement of fracture stages. Optimum fracture spacing need not necessarily be uniformly distributed along the horizontal wellbore, especially when prior reservoir properties, for example natural fracture density, are available from well logs and other sources. A systematic and efficient approach to fracture design will be demonstrated, constrained by long-term well performance while accounting for specific economic parameters. The power and practical utility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a three-dimensional synthetic example. We find that there are an optimum number of fracture stages for a given reservoir. If adequate geological, geophysical, and engineering data are available to estimate reservoir heterogeneity before hydraulic fracturing, fracturing spacing can be further optimized instead of evenly spaced. If there is uncertainty associated with reservoir heterogeneity, multiple realizations can be integrated in the proposed optimization workflow. "

                    "abstract": "Traditional history matching involves calibration of reservoir models by use of well response such as production or tracer data aggregated during multiple producing intervals. With the advent of novel tracer technologies, we now can obtain distributed water or tracer arrival-time information along the length of horizontal or vertical wellbores. This provides significantly improved flow resolution for detailed reservoir characterization through inversion of distributed water or tracer arrival times in a manner analogous to travel tomography in geophysics. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to incorporate novel tracer-surveillance data and distributed water arrival-time information during history matching of high-resolution reservoir models. Our approach relies on a streamline-based work flow that analytically computes the sensitivity of water-arrival times with respect to reservoir heterogeneity, specifically porosity and permeability variations. The sensitivities relate the changes in arrival time to small perturbations in reservoir properties and can be obtained efficiently with the streamline-based approach with a single flow simulation. This makes the approach particularly wellsuited for high-resolution reservoir characterization. Finally, the sensitivities are used in conjunction with an iterative inversion algorithm to update the reservoir models with existing and proven techniques from seismic tomography. The power and utility of our proposed approach are demonstrated with both synthetic and field examples. These include the SPE benchmark Brugge field case and an offshore field in North America. Compared with traditional history-matching techniques, the proposed tomographic approach is shown to result in improved resolution of heterogeneity through matching of water arrival time at individual completions in addition to the aggregated well-production response. This results in improved performance predictions and better identification of bypassed oil for infill targeting and enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) applications. "

                    "abstract": "The effective use of streamline simulators for flow simulation of high resolution 3D models relies on the ability to take large simulation time-steps with few pressure solutions. For processes that are convective, the streamline approach works quite well, but for flow simulation with strong capillarity or gravity terms, the maximum time step size is reduced, limiting the utility of streamline simulation. The impact is particularly pronounced for compositional simulations that require numerous flash calculations. This paper presents the development of a 3D 3-phase compositional streamline simulator and its application to field-scale CO2 injection. The novel aspect of our approach is the ability to incorporate gravity and capillary effects into compositional streamline simulation without adversely impacting its computational efficiency. In our approach, we use an orthogonal projection method to reformulate the streamline transport equations so that the fluxes of capillary and gravity are separated into components parallel and orthogonal to the total velocity defining the streamline trajectories. Fluxes parallel to total velocity are included within the solution of the convective flow equations on streamlines. The remaining terms are calculated on the underlying three dimensional grid. Because the size of the remaining transverse flux correction terms is significantly reduced, we are able to take large time steps. The ability to effectively incorporate transverse fluxes in streamline transport calculations will be a step change in streamline simulation in general. We demonstrate that our proposed treatment of transverse fluxes allows us to efficiently study high resolution migration of CO2 in the subsurface with potential applications to both improved oil recovery as well as carbon sequestration. First, we establish the validity and computational efficiency of our approach using a series of numerical experiments in 3D with the benchmark SPE10 example. Next, we apply the method to a field-scale CO2 injection project in the North Sea. The streamline model is shown to be particularly effective to visualize the interactions between natural heterogeneity, capillary and buoyancy forces, and CO2 transport and the resulting impact on the vertical and areal sweep efficiencies. An optimal CO2 injection strategy is proposed to maximize the sweep efficiencies and incremental oil recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing treatment in naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs generally induce complex fracture geometries. Thus an unstructured grid, instead of a Cartesian or corner point grid, is preferred to accurately model the geometry of the fractures and the performance of such reservoirs. The drawback of conventional simulation on unstructured grids is the potentially heavy computational cost. A novel approach has recently been introduced to provide rapid simulation of unconventional reservoirs, which first captures the drainage volume during the transient propagation process using the Fast Marching Method (FMM) and then rapidly solves fluid flow equation in an equivalent 1D domain. However, this application is currently limited to calculating the reservoir response with Cartesian or corner-point grids. In this study, the FMM based simulation method is extended to unstructured grid. A new mesh generation approach is first presented to discretize the complex fracture network, accounting for both hydraulic fractures and natural fractures. Voronoi cells (or perpendicular bisector, i.e. PEBI grids) are constructed with high resolution near the fractures and with larger cells far from fractures. A force-equilibrium algorithm is adopted here to optimize the mesh quality and reduce highly skewed cells. FMM algorithm is computed on the basis of subdivided triangles, which can provide the diffusive time of flight (DToF) at both Voronoi cell vertices and cell centers. Thus, a more accurate calculation of drainage volume in unconventional reservoir with complex fracture networks can be obtained. Finally, fluid flow is calculated in transformed 1D domain, where DToF acts as the 1D spatial coordinate. Unstructured grids with good mesh quality are constructed to accurately capture the complex fracture network system. The convergence characteristic of FMM on unstructured grids is investigated. Reservoir simulation is efficiently computed based on the drainage volume information from the unstructured grid system using FMM, and the simulation results are validated with finite-difference based and finite-volume based numerical results. There are three key parts of this proposed approach, which are: (i) good mesh generation technique to capture complex fracture networks, (ii) FMM computation on unstructured grids to provide the drainage volume, and (iii) fluid flow calculation in transformed 1D domain. We extend the reservoir simulation using FMM in unconventional reservoirs from Cartesian and corner point grid systems to unstructured grids. The proposed approach shows orders of magnitude reduction in simulation time for modeling unstructured grids, bringing typical simulation times of hours or days down to minutes, which is quite attractive for high-resolution models. Through the numerical examples, the proposed method is demonstrated to be an accurate and efficient approach to simulate naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs with unstructured grids. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Downhole temperature distribution in horizontal wells can be an important source of information that helps us characterize the reservoir and understand the bottom-hole flow conditions. The temperature measurements are obtained from permanent monitoring systems such as downhole temperature gauges and fiber optic sensors. Also, production history and bottomhole pressures are usually readily available and are routinely used for history matching to improve the initial geological models. Combining the downhole temperature distribution and the production history, we can extract more reliable information about the reservoir permeability distribution and bottomhole flow conditions that help us optimize the wellbore performance, particularly in horizontal wells.  In this paper, we use a thermal model and a transient, 3D, multiphase flow reservoir model to calculate the wellbore temperature distribution in horizontal wells. By comparing the simulated temperature and the observed data, we first derive large-scale permeability trends in the reservoir. These permeability trends are then incorporated as ‘secondary' information in the geologic model building and history matching. .Finally, the updated permeability models from history matching are used to infer the downhole flow conditions along horizontal wells. The final outcome is a geologic model that is consistent with reservoir static and dynamic information, and also the wellbore temperature measurements.  We present several synthetic cases to illustrate the procedure. The results show that with only production history matching without distributed data along the wellbore, the water entry location in horizontal wells can not be detected satisfactorily. Combining production history matching with the temperature distribution in the wellbore, we can get an improved geological model that can match the production history and also, locate the water entry correctly. Based on the downhole flow conditions and the updated geological model, we can now optimize the well performance by controlling the inflow rate distribution, such as shutting the high water inflow sections.  Introduction Horizontal wells are now routinely applied as part of the oil and gas field development strategy. Inferring reservoir and downhole flow conditions are important aspects of production and recovery optimization of horizontal wells. The commonly used method to obtain downhole flow conditions is production logging, and more recently, downhole temperature and pressure sensors become a valuable addition for accessing downhole flow conditions. Many studies have been presented in analyzing these data for production optimization. Alaeddin and Maizeret (2003) used production logging technology to evaluate the contribution of two horizontal legs and possible water entry locations. This information can help to manage reservoir for optimizing the re-development plan of the field. Alhuthali et al. (2007) provided an optimal waterflood reservoir management by rate control. Their results show that the correct rate control for horizontal well with ICV completions can delay the water breakthrough time and significantly increase the reservoir recovery. Real time production data is also used for optimizing oil recovery in multilateral wells (Alghareeb et al., 2009). Based on the production history data and reservoir permeability distribution, an optimum ICV configuration can be obtained so as to minimize water cut and maximize net present value. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We introduce a novel reservoir parameterization approach to mitigate the challenges associated with field-scale history matching. In this approach, the reservoir property field is mapped to and updated in a low-dimensional transform domain using a linear transformation basis. The transformation basis vectors are the eigenvectors of a Laplacian matrix that is constructed using grid connectivity information and the main features in a given prior model. Because the grid connectivity information is computed only within a small multi-point stencil, the Laplacian is always sparse and is amenable to efficient decomposition. The resulting basis functions are ordered from large to small scale and include prior-specific spatial features. Therefore, the variability in reservoir property distribution can be effectively represented by projecting the property field onto subspaces spanned by an increasing number of leading basis vectors, each incorporating additional heterogeneity features into the model description. This property lends itself to a multiscale history matching algorithm where basis elements are sequentially included to refine the heterogeneity characterization to a level of complexity supported by the resolution of data. While the method can benefit from prior information, in the extreme case where reliable prior knowledge is not available the transformation reduces to a discrete Fourier expansion with model-independent parameterization properties.  We present the derivation and theoretical justification of the proposed method and review its important properties for reservoir parameterization including efficient one-time construction of the basis prior to calibration, applicability to any grid geometry and strong compression performance. The multiscale history matching algorithm begins by updating the prior reservoir model using a parameterized multiplier field that is superimposed onto the grid and assigned an initial value of unity at each cell. The multiplier is sequentially refined from the coarse to finer scales during minimization of production data misfit. This method permits selective updating of heterogeneity at locations and levels of detail sensitive to the available data, otherwise leaving the prior model unchanged as desired. We successfully apply the parameterization approach to history match several reservoir models, including a field case, using an adaptive multiscale algorithm.  Introduction The calibration of geologic reservoir model heterogeneity to production data is an integral part of reservoir engineering workflows that ultimately contribute to reservoir management and field development decisions. Regardless of the conceptual approach taken to reservoir model calibration (e.g., structured [Landa and Horne, 1997; Williams et al., 1998; Yin et al., 2010], parsimonious [Grimstad et al., 2003; Doherty, 2005; Mannseth, 2006; Bhark et al., 2011c] or high-resolution [Vasco et al., 1997; Vasco et al., 1999; Muffels et al., 2006]), a pervasive component in nearly all approaches is a form of parameter or model reduction as a method of regularization by which the difficulties of the under-determined inverse problem of dynamic data integration become more tractable. Either through grid construction or through characterization of the estimable properties at grid cell resolution, the intent of parameterization is necessarily to construct a low dimensional representation of the geologic system, characterizing only those features important to the flow and transport processes studied, by exploiting both the inherent spatial associations of geologic properties and the general insensitivity of dynamic data, production data in particular, to finer scale detail.

                    "abstract": "We present a probabilistic approach for integrating multiple data into subsurface flow models. Our approach is based on a Bayesian framework whereby we exhaustively sample the multi-dimensional posterior distribution to define a Pareto front which represents the trade-off between multiple objectives during history matching. These objectives can be matching of water-cut, GOR, BHP and time-lapse seismic data. For field applications, these objectives do not necessarily move in tandem because of measurement errors and also interpretative nature of the seismic data. Our proposed method is built on a Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DEMC) algorithm in which multiple Markov Chains are run in parallel. First, a dominance relationship is established amongst multiple models. This is followed by construction of the posterior distribution based on a hypervolume measure. A unique aspect of our method is the proposal selection which is based on a random walk on two arbitrarily selected chains. This promotes effective mixing of the chains resulting in improved convergence. We illustrate the algorithm using a nine-spot waterflood model whereby we use water-cut and bottomhole flowing pressure data to calibrate the permeability field. The permeability field is reparameterized using a previously proposed Grid Connectivity Transform (GCT) which is defined based on a decomposition of the grid Laplacian. The compression power of GCT allows us to reconstruct the permeability field with few parameters, thus significantly improving the computational efficiency of the MCMC approach. Next, we applied the method to the Brugge benchmark case involving 10 water injectors and 20 producers. For both cases, the algorithm provides an ensemble of models all constrained to the history data and defines a probabilistic Pareto front in the objective space. Several experimental runs were conducted to compare the effectiveness of the algorithm with NonDominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms (NSGA). Higher hypervolume was constantly measured using our algorithm which indicates that more optimal solutions were sampled. Our method provides a novel approach for subsurface model calibration and uncertainty quantification using MCMC in which the communication between parallel Markov chains enhances adequate mixing. This significantly improves the convergence without loss in sampling quality. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can efficiently integrate seemingly conflicting data into reservoir models while quantifying uncertainties. Besides reservoir model calibration, we expect that the algorithm will find application in probabilistic production optimization problems as well. "

                    "abstract": "Acid stimulation is commonly used in carbonate reservoirs, which can be either matrix acidizing or acid fracturing. In both treatments, wormholes can form. In matrix acidizing, wormholing is favorable because the damaged region can be bypassed. In acid fracturing, wormholing is not desired because it can increase fluid loss, which can limit conductive fracture length. Three major processes are involved for wormholing: convection, diffusion and surface reaction. A thorough understanding of these processes is necessary for engineering design. In this paper, we fundamentally explore wormholing mechanisms starting from pore growth. A wormhole forms when larger pores grow in cross-sectional area at a rate that greatly exceeds the growth rate of smaller pores due to surface reaction. This happens when pore growth follows a particular mechanism, which is discussed in this paper. We developed a model to predict wormhole growth behavior. The model uses the mode-size pore in a pore size distribution - the pore size that appears most frequently in a distribution - to predict the growth of the pore. By controlling the acid velocity inside of it, we can make larger pores grow much faster than other smaller pores, thus reaching the most favorable condition for wormholing. This also results in a balance between overall acid/rock reaction and acid flow. By understanding the wormholing mechanism, engineers can select proper treatment fluids and pumping rate for acid stimulation design. "

                    "abstract": "Downhole temperature data obtained by either temperature logging or fiber-optic cables have been used to evaluate stimulation treatments and post-stimulation performance of horizontal wells with multiple fractures. Field cases qualitatively show capabilities of detecting creation of transverse fractures, poor zonal isolation, and inflow locations, although downhole temperature behavior in those wells is not fully understood from the theoretical modeling perspective. In this study, we present comprehensive numerical flow and thermal models for a horizontal well with multiple fractures. The well experiences single-phase water flow during injection and shut-in, and gas/water two-phase flow during production. These models are formulated for reservoir and wellbore domains with consideration of their coupling. The reservoir models are formulated in 3D space using mass conservation of each component and thermal energy conservation with Darcy’s law in transient conditions. The wellbore models are also transient, and formulated for 1D space using mass conservation of each component, conservation of combined-phase momentum, and total energy conservation. The wellbore- and sandface-temperature profiles are obtained as solutions of these models. These models enable us to simulate field operations in multistage-fracturing treatment; injection and shut-in occur alternately for each stage from toe to heel with zonal isolation. After the stimulation treatments, these models are used to simulate temperature behavior during production in gas/water two-phase flow. We show an example of a single fracture in which the developed model simulates temperature behavior during injection, shut-in, and production to show capabilities of the developed model. This study shows that injected fluid makes the fluid temperature in the fracture lower than the geothermal temperature even after 1 month of shut-in. This affects the temperature interpretation during production because the initial temperature is different from the geothermal temperature assumed as the initial temperature by most studies published previously. A synthetic case with five fractures demonstrates capabilities of detection of created-fracture locations from the shut-in temperature profile. In addition, we apply the model to a field case of distributed-temperature-sensor (DTS) temperature profiles during warmback after multistage hydraulic fracturing, and 30 days after the start of the production in this well. The good match obtained between this model and the DTS data from this well indicates how this modeling approach can be used to estimate the production from individual perforation clusters. The case studies illustrate qualitative interpretations in situations occurring in fields, such as warm-up behavior with multiple clusters during the shut-in period. This paper provides insights from the theoretical modeling perspective for downhole temperature interpretation qualitatively performed at the current time. It also discusses the validity of the assumptions made in previous studies and precautions relevant to those assumptions. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting is a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, with observed positive production enhancement in some extended-reach horizontal wells. It is a process in which a reactive chemical solution is injected at a high rate at specific entry points via relatively smaller nozzles. The flow out of the nozzles is designed to be a fully turbulent jet which impinges on the porous surface of the rock, leading to a dissolution structure. That dissolution structure is of great interest as it determines the quality of the well stimulation job, which correlates directly to the well productivity. This work is the second step in the overall project about a comprehensive study of acid jetting as a successful stimulation method for carbonate formations. The first step was an experimental study performed using a linear core-flood setup including a jetting nozzle. The objective was to understand the mechanism of acid jetting on carbonate cores and identify the important parameters in the experimental outcome. The current study aims at describing acid jetting from a mathematical standpoint, while using experimental results as model validation and improvement tools. Previously published acid jetting laboratory experiments results revealed the recurring creation of a large dissolution structure at the impingement location in the shape of a cavity and, depending on injection conditions, the propagation of wormholes through the core. A core-scale computational fluid dynamics model has been developed to simulate cavity and wormhole growth in acid jetting. It is a three-dimensional model which alternates between the two fundamental aspects of the overall acid jetting process. Firstly, it models the fluid mechanics of the turbulent jet exiting the nozzle and continuously impinging on the porous media transient surface. The jet fluid dynamics are implemented using a 3D transient finite volume numerical solver using Large Eddy Simulations (LES) with the Smagorinsky-Lilly sub-grid model to solve the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. The results of this simulation include a velocity and pressure distribution at the porous media surface. Secondly, it models an irreversible chemical reaction with dissolution and transport at the impingement location between the fluid and the rock matrix. The reactive transport is modeled using the conventional kinetics of the dissolution of calcite by hydrochloric acid. This two-step model successfully replicates experimental results and observations for the cavity growth. It can then be coupled with a wormhole growth model to represent the entire experimental acid jetting outcome. The modeling and computational tool for acid jetting developed in this paper will build the understanding for the upscaling and integrated dynamic modeling of an acid jetting stimulation job in the field. It will thus lead to the establishment of a standard for predicting and improving field applications of acid jetting. "

                    "abstract": "Modeling acid fracturing operations in carbonate formations is performed to evaluate the possible improvement in well productivity. Models are developed to mainly estimate the acid penetration length and the fracture surfaces etched-width profile. Variable combinations of these two parameters produce a significant difference in the fracture productivity. To better estimate these parameters, a reliable fracture propagation model should be coupled with the acid reaction/transport model. Simulating weak acids or dolomite formations reactivity requires the inclusion of a heat transfer model. The model provided in this study couples these factors as fractures propagate to finally obtain the fracture conductivity distribution along its length. The fracture propagation model continuously updates the domain for the acid model. A transient acid convection and diffusion equation is solved and the fracture etched-width profile is calculated. An iterative procedure is implemented in a temperature dependent kinetic model which is stopped when both the temperature and acid solutions converge. When injection stops, acid etching and the fluids temperature are updated as the fracture closes. As the final etching profile is drawn, conductivity is calculated using a correlation that considers formation heterogeneity. Coupling fracture propagation shows a significant difference on the acid model solutions compared to that assuming constant fracture geometry. For extremely high Peclet number that represents a very retarded acid system, a constant drop in the etched-width value until reaching zero at the fracture tip is theoretically obtainable. For lower Peclet numbers, the etching profile is shown to be sharply declining towards the fracture end. This is in contrast with the non-coupled approach from which a uniform etching profile is obtained at moderate to high Peclet numbers. It is also observed that the simulation of acid injection in non-coupled, constant fracture geometry always overestimates the acid penetration distance. The etched-width distribution and the acid penetration length are temperature sensitive, especially in dolomite formations. Temperature coupling shows that the maximum etching in dolomite formations occurs away from the fracture entrance as acid reactivity increases. It also shows that the cooling effects of the first stage pad fluid on improving the acid penetration distance is limited. Simulating acid fracturing operations assuming constant final fracture geometry and an average single temperature is time efficient but results in inaccurate solution. This paper quantifies the effects of integrating fracture propagating and heat transfer models on the acid etching pattern from which, a better estimate of the fracture productivity is expected. "

Recent developments in downhole fiber optic sensing technology introduced a more continuous measurement of temperature both temporally and spatially for flow diagnosis. One of the powerful applications of temperature measurements is to diagnose multistage fracture treatments. Because the fiber optic temperature measurements can be available during fracturing, during shut-in, and during production, the integrated interpretation provides information of fracture/flow distribution. This information helps to understand what happened during fracture treatments, to identify problems in treatment design and execution, and to improve the efficiency of multistage fracture stimulation. The key component of fracturing diagnosis by temperature measurements is the interpretation models. In this paper, we present the models developed for fracture diagnosis. The mathematical models are built on mass, momentum and energy conservation of each component (reservoir, fracture, well completion and wellbore) in the system, and the components are linked through the boundary conditions. All models can be solved numerically, but for computational efficiency, analytical/semianalytical solutions are preferred when available. To correctly simulate heat transfer during fracture propagation, a fracture geometry model with appropriate leak off description is integrated into the model buildup. For flow problem in a fractured well, analytical model, streamline approach and reservoir simulation can all be the solution methods. The paper compares the advantages of each approach. Field cases from the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus shale formations are presented in the paper to illustrate how the models can be used to generate the fracture/flow distribution. The results show that temperature measurement is a comprehensive tool for fracture diagnosis. "

Extensive research has been done to study the optimal acidizing conditions for limestone. However, very few studies have been reported on acidizing dolomite rocks. This paper presents an experimental study on acidizing dolomite rock samples. In this research, we cut a dolomite block from a Silurian formation in Thornton Quarry, Illinois. This block was drilled into core samples with dimensions of 1.5-in. diameter by 8-in. long. We first measured the mineralogy of the rock samples to ensure the lithology to be studied. The test shows that more than 99% of the rock mineral is dolomite. To study the effectiveness of acidizing, we then did acidizing coreflood experiments with 15 wt% HCl at different temperatures. These temperatures are 122 °F, 185 °F and 260 °F. Wormhole efficiency relationships were generated, and the optimal acid injection conditions were determined respectively from these experiments. The dissolution patterns created during each experiment was found by CT-scanning each core after acid injection. Experimental results show that the optimal acid interstitial velocity increases with increasing temperature. However, the rate of increase between 122 °F and 185 °F is significantly larger than the rate of increase between 185 °F and 260 °F. It is due to the difference of increase for acid diffusion rate and surface reaction rate, which is discussed in this paper. Interestingly, unlike limestone, the corresponding optimal breakthrough pore volume decreases with increasing temperature from 122 °F to 185 °F, and increases slightly from 185 °F to 260 °F. This indicates that more volume of acid is needed for reservoirs of lower temperature. Based on the experimental results and an upscaling method, an application scheme is presented for dolomite reservoirs with varying temperatures, which can be used for engineering references. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting, as a well-stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended-reach horizontal wells. It was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore by means of multiple strategically located injection nozzles. It has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation. Jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing. The hypotheses for the design of more-efficient stimulation treatments are currently being investigated. We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency. Each jetting experiment was conducted as a constant-pressure (equivalent to a desired initial flux through the core) linear coreflood test, in which a standoff distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core. At low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter cake by mechanical actions. Jetting also creates wormholes in limestone cores. The combination of mechanical and chemical reaction stimulates limestone rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle. When the jetting velocity increased, the dissolution pattern changed. An isolated local compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure. With the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome. We used Indiana and Winterset limestone rocks in the experiments. A 15% hydrochloric acid (HCl) (by weight) at ambient temperature was used, and the core dimensions were 4 in. in diameter and 16 in. in length. Various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered. The Winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the Indiana limestone cores. The experimental results from the two different rock samples are compared. Overall, the experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing, regarding wormhole propagation after cavities are created. Jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results. Acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for the cores from Indiana limestone and Winterset limestone. The observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic physical and chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid-stimulation jobs. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting occurs as a result of pumping acid through limited entry liner completions, causing high velocity streams to impinge against the wellbore wall. The dissolution effect of jetting differs significantly from conventional matrix acidizing. Acid jetting causes cavities to be formed at the points of contact of the jet with the rock, with wormholes forming beyond the cavity. Jetting has been shown to be an effective technique for placing acid along extended reach laterals, removing filter cake, and enhancing wormhole propagation. The velocity of the impinging jet and its standoff distance from the rock causes some of the acid to penetrate the formation and some to flow back in the annular space of the liner. Two types of dissolution mechanisms occur: surface dissolution forming the cavity, and matrix dissolution forming the wormholes. These dissolution mechanisms are highly dependent on acid injection rate, velocity of the jet, temperature, and permeability of the formation. The differences between the matrix dissolution mechanism of acid jetting and that of conventional matrix acidizing are most obvious at low acid injection rates. Experiments were performed with the intention of quantifying the difference in pore volume to breakthrough between acid jetting and matrix acidizing, as well as determining the effect of increased temperature, rock permeability and acid concentration on this value with respect to acid injection rate. Baseline parameters of room temperature, 15% HCl and 2-4 mD Indiana limestone were individually compared with experiments run at 180°F, 28% HCl, and Indiana limestone cores of 30, 60 mD, and 140 mD. The effect of jetting velocity was also investigated by changing the diameter of the orifice from which the stream exits. Direct comparison with conventional matrix acidizing was made by eliminating the jetting effect of the stream through mechanical dispersion. Acid jetting creates a point of heightened interstitial velocity at the contact of the acid and the rock, causing wormhole propagation to happen at a faster rate than it would in conventional matrix acidizing at that injection rate. This effect is especially pronounced as jetting velocity is raised above that of matrix acidizing, and tapers off at progressively higher jetting velocities. "

                    "abstract": "It was recently shown that anisotropic wormhole networks may arise from the acidizing of anisotropic carbonates. In openhole or cased and densely perforated completions, where in isotropic formations the wormhole network would be expected to be radial around the well, the actual stimulated region may be elliptical in anisotropic formations. Analogously, in completions where the limited entry technique is used, the wormhole network is expected to be spherical in isotropic formations, but it may actually be ellipsoidal in anisotropic formations. That has an impact on the well performance and should be taken into account when designing the acidizing treatment and the completion. At the same time, the use of a limited entry technique may result in better stimulation coverage and also longer wormholes, but it may also result in a partial completion skin factor, impairing the productivity from the stimulated well. This should be taken into account when estimating the stimulated well productivity. In this study two main topics are analyzed: the impact of wormhole network anisotropy and the impact of a limited entry completion. Both radial and spherical wormhole propagation patterns are considered, to be applied in both openhole and limited entry completions. The differences in well performance is studied for each case, and analytical equations for the skin factor resulting from each scenario are presented. The anisotropic wormhole networks are obtained from numerical simulations using the averaged continuum model, and the results are validated with experimental data. The analysis of the well performance is made through simulation of the flow in the reservoir with the different stimulated regions. The results show that for highly anisotropic formations the wormhole network anisotropy may have a great impact on the acidized well performance and this should be taken into account in the acidizing treatment design. It was observed that the anisotropic wormhole networks present lower productivity than equally sized isotropic stimulated regions. Hence, equations like Hawkins formula should not be used for estimating the skin factor from anisotropic wormhole networks, and the equations proposed in this work should be used instead. Specifically, the impact of anisotropic wormhole networks is large when the limited entry technique is used. It is shown that for this type of completion there is an optimum stimulation coverage of about 60 to 70%, and the perforation density required to obtain for a given acid volume depends strongly on the wormholes' anisotropy. The skin factor equations proposed in this work for the stimulation with limited entry completion should be used for obtaining the optimum perforation density for a given scenario. "

                    "abstract": "During an acid fracturing treatment in a carbonate reservoir, acid is injected into the formation creating hydraulic fractures and opening existing natural fractures. As the acid flows into natural fractures intersecting hydraulic fractures (main fractures), it etches the walls of the natural fracture, which increases the natural fractures' width and generates conductivity. On the other hand, because of the existence of natural fractures, the acid volume in the main fracture reduces, resulting in less conductivity for the main fracture. Existing acid fracturing models estimate the fracture conductivity by assuming the acid flows and reacts in the hydraulic fractures only. In order to accurately predict the performance of acid fracturing in naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs, the acid etching of natural fractures should be taken into account when calculating the overall fracture conductivity. A model is developed to predict the acid fracturing performance in naturally fractured reservoirs. The model assumes that the main fracture is intersected by transverse symmetric natural fractures. The model simulates the acid transport, acid-rock reaction, fracture width increase due to etching of fracture walls, and acid leakoff through natural fractures. The model also assumes that the flow into natural fractures and the leakoff are pressure dependent and are changing with time. The conductivity calculation is based on the previously developed correlation that takes into account the small scale rock heterogeneities. The conductivity of natural fractures was found to be a strong function of the leakoff Peclet number, which depends on the velocity of acid flow into natural fractures from an intersecting hydraulic fracture. The effect of natural fractures' geometry on leakoff Peclet number and created fracture conductivity was investigated. The results show that both length and dynamic width, as well as the number of natural fractures, play a significant role in defining the leakoff rate and the conductivity of the hydraulic fracture and the natural fractures. It was also found that the position of the natural fractures along the hydraulic fracture length affects the etching of the natural fractures and the resultant conductivity. The model will enable the prediction of acid fracture conductivity for naturally fractured reservoirs and improve the feasibility of acid fracturing applications for these type of formations. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional rock classification in carbonate reservoirs typically requires considerable amount of core data, which usually may not be available at the depth resolution required for each target interval. In cases of tight carbonate rocks with extremely low porosity (less than 5% in average) and permeability (less than 0.1 md), a reliable rock classification is essential for well stimulation modeling. Such rock classification should take into account depth-by-depth petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties of the formation. In this paper, we apply an integrated rock classification technique to enhance (a) well-log-based estimates of petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties and (b) selection of appropriate candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design in a tight carbonate reservoir in northern slope of Tazhong Uplift, Tarim Basin, China. We first perform multi-mineral analysis and estimate volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and fluid saturations. Since shear wave sonic logs are not available in most of the wells, we estimate elastic moduli using effective medium models including self-consistent approximation and differential effective medium theory. Corrections including the impact of fluids are developed using Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution. The inputs to the effective medium models include (a) the petrophysical and compositional properties obtained from well logs, (b) bulk and shear moduli for each mineral and fluid component, and (c) shape of rock inclusions (i.e., grains and pores). Core measurements are used for cross validating the well-log-based estimates of elastic moduli and petrophysical properties. Accordingly, we proposed a rock classification technique using unsupervised neural network that integrated depth-by-depth volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and elastic moduli. Finally, we derived permeability models in each rock type and estimated the permeability in the target depth intervals. Variogram analysis on well-log-based estimates of permeability provides correlation lengths as inputs to acid fracturing treatment modeling. We successfully applied the technique introduced here to a challenging tight gas interval of Tarim field in China. The estimated porosity and permeability were in good agreement with laboratory core measurements. The identified rock classes were verified by core samples and thin sections. We estimated elastic moduli with average relative errors of approximately 13% compare to the core measurements. The estimated elastic moduli were used as a key input for modeling of acid-fracturing treatments and improved stimulation success. The rock classification technique introduced here provides important input parameters for well stimulation modeling, gives insight into evaluation of acid fracturing in tight carbonate reservoir, and helps with selection of best candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design.

                    "abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology heralded as a means of direct interrogation of flow distribution, a diagnosis tool for stimulation operation success, and production distribution in horizontal multi-stage fractured wells. A challenge that has come about from the use of distributed acoustic sensing system is processing, interpretation, and diagnosis of the vast amounts of data produced. Unlike distributed temperature sensing, the data provided by DAS is originally presented in sound amplitude as a function of time. For a defined time interval, the data is first translated to amplitude as a function of frequency, and then the characteristics of both amplitude and frequency is related to flow conditions. Using the characteristics of amplitude and frequency to understand flow distribution is mostly qualitative in the field today. This study started with building a physical simulator in the lab and flowing nitrogen gas through a parallel-plate fracture cell with proppant packs of different permeabilities. A horizontal wellbore section was connected to the fracture cell through a perforation to simulate fractured well flow. Data was collected using an array of microphones distributed along the length of the simulated horizontal wellbore and a directional hydrophone at the toe of the simulated wellbore. The amplitude-frequency characteristic of this acoustic signal is obtained from raw measurements of acoustic pressure via Fast Fourier Transform. A relationship between flow rate and sound pressure level is proposed based on the observation of experiments. With the lab observation, we then modeled acoustic wave behavior in a domain consisting of a perforation and a pipe. Computational fluid dynamics simulation was carried out to simulate the gas flow through the perforation, and the simulated acoustic signals were compared with the lab-observed signals. Modeling of the fluid flow is subdivided into two parts: fluid flow through the proppant pack near the perforation, and fluid flow through the perforation into the wellbore. The proppant pack is described as a set of spherical particles which allows creation of an analogy of the porous structure. In the second part of the simulation, we assume steady state fluid flow through the perforation into the wellbore. This fluid flow creates a noise which is measured along the center of the wellbore. Different types of proppant packing were considered during simulation of the first part of the model. A two-size mesh model was used as the most complex type of packing in this research. Simulations of fluid flow through these structures were conducted for incompressible and compressible fluids. These results allow defining the pressure profile in the inlet of the perforation. For the second part of modeling the main pressure drop is observed along the perforation. Noise is induced from fluid flow out of this perforation with a small diameter in comparison with the diameter of the wellbore. Simulation of 10 seconds of fluid flow was conducted in order to collect enough data for acoustic measurements. Acoustic wave peaks are observed in the amplitude-frequency characteristic plot, and these peaks respond to the different types of fluid and flow rates. Sound pressure level is obtained from amplitude-frequency characteristics and is compared with experimental results. "

                    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing is a commonly used stimulation technique for oil and gas wells. In carbonate reservoirs, acid is injected into the formation to dissolve carbonate rock and create highly permeable channels called wormholes. For a constant volume of acid injection, different injection rates create wormholes with different lengths. The injection rate that creates the deepest wormhole is called the optimal acid-injection rate. Optimal injection rate is determined in laboratory experiments by measuring the pore volumes to breakthrough (i.e., the volume of acid injected in a coreflood for the wormhole to reach the exit end of the core, normalized by the initial pore volume of the core). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used for carbonate acidizing treatments. The reaction between HCl and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) creates carbon dioxide (CO2). At laboratory conditions, 1,000-psi backpressure is commonly used for acidizing experiments to keep CO2 in solution. However, on the basis of the solubility of CO2 in water, 1,000 psi may not be enough to keep CO2 in solution. In such a case, undissolved CO2 can be present as a gaseous phase in the system. Because the properties of CO2 change with pressure and temperature, the evolution of CO2 and its effect on wormhole-propagation efficiency need to be investigated to evaluate optimal acid-injection conditions accurately. In this study, coreflooding experiments are conducted to examine the effects of evolved CO2 on wormholing behavior. The experiments are conducted at both room temperature and an elevated temperature. Different backpressures from 500 to 3,000 psi are applied in the experiments. The Buijse and Glasbergen (2005) model is used for curve fitting to obtain the optimal acid flux and optimal pore volume to breakthrough for each experiment. Computed-tomography (CT) -scan images are taken for each core sample after acid injection to evaluate the structures of the wormholes. The test results show that the effect of CO2 on wormholing depends on the temperature, pressure, and injection rate. For low injection rate, CO2 present as a gaseous phase slows wormhole-propagation efficiency dramatically, and enlarged wormhole diameter is observed. At injection rates greater than the optimal rate, the effect of CO2 is less pronounced, particularly at higher temperatures. "

                    "abstract": "It has been well-understood that there exists an optimal condition in matrix acidizing in carbonate formations. When a treatment is not pumped at the optimal conditions, the efficiency of the stimulation suffers. A cost-effective procedure for maximizing matrix acidizing treatment results in carbonates is proposed. This procedure includes a systematic approach to altering the acid schedule, pump schedule and the placement technique. The procedure is particularly important for high temperature or long treatment intervals where achieving optimal injection rate is difficult. Injecting acid below the optimal injection rate in matrix acidizing of carbonates can negatively impact productivity/injectivity by significantly limiting the final skin reduction. To design a treatment that creates dominant wormholes to improve well performance, the optimal pumping rate must first be determined based on the field conditions which can be scaled up from laboratory core flood data. For cases where the optimal injection rate cannot be achieved because of the limitation of pumping equipment, this paper proposes a counter-intuitive procedure for altering the treatment design. There are means to reduce optimal injection rate for a treatment, such as changing acid concentration, acid type or additives. Reducing acid strength can lead to a slower reaction rate and deeper wormhole penetration. There is however a limit since reducing the acid strength will not only reduce the optimal interstitial velocity but also increase the acid volumes required for breakthrough because of lower acid dissolving power. If the optimal pumping rate cannot be sufficiently reduced, then the placement techniques must be modified to facilitate higher injection rates. Furthermore, the pump schedule must also consider heterogeneity and this may require the use of multiple stages. Using published core flood data along with hypothetical well designs, various acid treatments have been simulated, and the results are presented in terms of skin factor along the well length for each injection strategy. The study demonstrates the application of the proposed procedure. The results of the study showed that in cases where the pumping rate is less than optimal, simulation results show less than optimal skin factors are predicted. When pumping at low rates, using the highest concentration of acid does not necessarily result in the most efficient wormhole creation and propagation. There is a clear limit to which reducing acid strength can benefit the degree of penetration for a given injection rate. The proposed procedure is a practical means of creating a cost effective acidizing design that not only removes formation damage but creates deep dominant wormholes that minimize the skin factor. "

                    "abstract": "The optimum design of matrix acidizing operations in carbonate reservoirs is a discussion in progress. Although there are several models available to the industry for predicting wormhole propagation, most of them are not practical enough to be used in real treatment designs, or were developed to represent core flood data and cannot be simply scaled up to represent wormhole formation in complex well geometries. This problem is addressed by Furui's wormhole propagation model, which is a modification of Buijse and Glasbergen empirical correlation including a scale up procedure to represent field carbonate acidizing operations using laboratory core flood data. It is a practical engineering tool that can be used for treatment designs in horizontal wells, including barefoot and perforation-cluster completions in fairly isotropic and homogeneous reservoirs. In this work an analysis of Furui's model is performed, including the effect of anisotropy in the carbonate reservoir. The analysis includes both radial or elliptical wormhole propagation that forms from an openhole completion and the spherical or ellipsoidal wormhole propagation that emerges from each perforation in a perforation-cluster completion that makes use of a limited-entry technique for achieving good acid placement. The development is made using extensive 3D numerical simulations with a two-scale continuum model and finite volumes method to represent the dissolution of the porous medium. The numerical model is tuned to represent real results through matching experimental core flood data and dissolution patterns. Some conclusions are obtained regarding both isotropic and anisotropic formations. In isotropic formations with radial propagation of wormholes, simulations indicate that a number from four to six wormholes propagate radially in each plane. When the propagation is spherical, simulations result in a number from 16 to 24 wormholes propagating spherically from the point of acid injection. In anisotropic formations, the radial stimulated zone might become an elliptic stimulated zone, depending on the acid injection rate and the permeability heterogeneity magnitude. The major axis of the elliptic stimulated zone coincides with the direction of higher permeability and longer permeability correlation length, and it is longer for larger acid injection rates. Analogously, the spherical wormholes propagation pattern might become an ellipsoidal stimulated zone in anisotropic formations. "

This rate is currently obtained through fitting acidizing-coreflood experimental results. A model is needed to predict optimal acid-injection rates for various reservoir conditions. A wormhole forms when larger pores grow in the cross-sectional area at a rate that greatly exceeds the growth rate of smaller pores caused by surface reaction. This happens when the pore growth follows a particular mechanism, which is discussed in this paper. We have developed a model to predict wormhole-growth behavior. The model uses the mode size in a pore-size distribution--the pore size that appears most frequently in the distribution--to predict the growth of the pore. By controlling the acid velocity inside of it, we can make this particular pore grow much faster than other smaller pores, thus reaching the most-favorable condition for wormholing. This also results in a balance between overall acid/rock reaction and acid flow. With the introduction of a porous-medium model, the acid velocity in the mode-size pore is scaled up to the interstitial velocity at the wormhole tip. This interstitial velocity at the wormhole tip controls the wormhole propagation. The optimal acid-injection rates are then calculated by use of semiempirical flow correlations for different flow geometries. The optimal injection rate depends on the rock lithology, acid concentration, temperature, and rock-pore-size distribution. All these factors are accounted for in this model. The model can predict the optimal rates of acidizing-coreflood experiments correctly, compared with our acidizing-coreflood experimental results. In addition, on the basis of our model, it is also found that at optimal conditions, the wormhole-propagation velocity is linearly proportional to the acid-diffusion coefficient for a diffusion-limited reaction. This is proved both experimentally and theoretically in this study. Because there is no flow-geometry constraint while developing this model, it can be applied to field scales. Applications are presented in this paper. "

All results are cross-compared to identify similarities and differences between formations as well as the most important parameters influencing fracture conductivity relative to each formation. The results indicate a positive trend between both Brinell hardness and Young's Modulus with fracture conductivity.

The mechanisms of water damage to fracture conductivity include clay swelling, surface softening, excessive proppant embedment, and fines migration due to fracture surface spalling and failed proppant particles. Fracture conductivity is influenced by closure stress, bulk and surface rock mechanical properties, fracture surface topography, fracture surface elemental composition, rock mineralogy, proppant type and concentration, among other factors. This paper presents a study considering several of the aforementioned factors, centered primarily on saline water induced fracture conductivity impairment of the Eagle Ford shale formation and its five vertical lithostratigraphic units. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of flowback water on fracture conductivity for Eagle Ford shale samples. The majority of test samples were obtained from an outcrop located in Antonio Creek, Terrell County, Texas; while the remaining samples were obtained from downhole core provided by an industry partner. Saline water with a similar chemical composition to the typical field flowback water was utilized. Fracture conductivity measurements were conducted in three stages. In the first stage, dry nitrogen was flowed to ascertain the undamaged initial fracture conductivity. In the second stage, the saline solution was injected into the fracture until steady state behavior was observed. In the third and final stage, dry nitrogen was once again flowed to quantify the recovered fracture conductivity. Reported mechanical properties from the same outcrop rock samples, consisting of Poisson's ratio and the Brinell hardness number, were considered in this study. Additionally, reported mineralogy obtained using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) microscopy was taken into consideration. The elemental composition along the fracture surface was obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy, and fracture surface topography was obtained using a laser surface scanner and profilometer. Results support findings that bulk and surface mechanical properties influence fracture conductivity, as well as surface topography and related attributes such as fracture surface area. Furthermore, the bulk mineralogical composition of the rock and the elemental composition of the rock fracture surface have a significant impact on fracture conductivity when flowing saline water in order to simulate flowback. Clay content was observed to directly influence fracture conductivity. The results of this study show a loss of fracture conductivity for Eagle Ford formation ranging from approximately 4 to 25 % after flowing saline water, when compared to the initial conductivity measured by flowing dry nitrogen before saline water exposure. This is not a large loss in conductivity due to water damage, and suggests that water damage may not be the major cause of the large early decline rates observed in most Eagle Ford shale producing wells.

Because empirical models are generally constrained by the data on which they are built, we developed a semiempirical model dependent on dimensional analysis and nonlinear regression. Dimensionless products from the dimensional analysis procedure form the backbone of this semiempirical model. We used subset-regression analysis to determine the optimal regression model and found that model was adequate. We also found two dimensionless groups and used them to develop the semiempirical model. We thereafter corrected the semiempirical model for the effect of temperature. Both the purely empirical model and the semiempirical model match experimental data with reasonable accuracy. These models can be used as a first approximation for the short-term fracture conductivity of field hydraulic fractures. We also present methodology by which engineers can develop empirical models, assess uncertainty, and test for regression-model adequacy given noisy data. "

                    "abstract": "Carbonate rocks have complex heterogeneities that result from syn- and post-depositional stressors. These heterogeneities invariably affect the movement of fluid through the formation. When considering an acid treatment procedure, care must be taken to optimize the acid concentration and pumping schedule to encourage the formation of wormholes. Despite the abundance of carbonate formations (60% of conventional reserves), there is little consensus on the effect of physical formation properties related to acidizing efficiency. This study characterizes the pore-size distribution for different carbonates and evaluates how the optimum pore volume to breakthrough, PVbt,opt, and the optimal interstitial flux, vi,opt, are related to various physical properties of the rock. The pore-size distributions evaluated in this study are constructed with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) imaging, a non-invasive X-Ray imaging technique pioneered in the medical field. Micro-CT is improved over medical CT because it can scan at higher energies and higher resolution. In this work, resolution for scanned samples range from 5-8 μm/voxel and sample sizes are approximately 1cm3. Image processing is applied to the raw CT data to segment pore space from the surrounding matrix. Object counter software is used to identify and measure individual pores, which can then be organized into a pore-size distribution. Statistical parameters are calculated by fitting a lognormal distribution function to each sample's pore-size distribution. We find that the shape of the pore-size distribution is influenced by the type of carbonate rock and that fitting the distribution yields better correlations to optimum acidizing parameters than permeability or porosity alone.

                    "abstract": "Experimental measurements of the fracture conductivity and rock mechanical properties are presented for the five different geological facies of the Eagle Ford shale (A, B, C, D and E) as defined by Donovan el al. (2012). In this classification, facies A lies right above the Buda limestone, followed by facies B which has the highest total organic content and production. This study places emphasis in this zone. Facies A and B are known as the lower Eagle Ford shale, whereas facies C, D and E are known as the upper Eagle Ford shale. Facies E underlies the Austin chalk. Conductivity samples in three orientations and core plugs in two orientations were obtained from outcrops samples. The orientations represent vertical fractures with flow in the horizontal direction (X0 orientation) or flow in the vertical direction (X90 orientation), and horizontal fractures with horizontal flow (Z orientation). Short term fracture conductivity experiments were performed using a modified API conductivity cell at room temperature. Unpropped and propped conductivities were measured with gas flow. Low proppant concentration was used in order to simulate a slick-water treatment. Proppants of various sizes were placed manually on a rough fracture face. The fracture faces were scanned with a surface profilometer to calculate the fracture roughness. Compressive triaxial tests were performed on the core plugs in order to determine the elastic rock properties such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. Additionally, Brinell hardness tests were completed to determine the resistance to embedment. Mineral composition was acquired by X-ray Diffraction analysis. The obtained fracture conductivities were compared to the fracture face roughness, elastic mechanical properties, Brinell hardness and mineralogy of the samples. It was found that propped and unpropped conductivities decline exponentially with closure stress. Propped conductivity was found to be dominated by proppant characteristics. Conductivity is positively related to rock brittleness and inversely related to Poisson's ratio. For the samples cut perpendicular to the bedding, no significant difference was found for between horizontal flow (X0) and vertical flow (X90). The parallel-bedding samples (Z) in general have lower conductivity compared with the perpendicular-bedding (both X0 and X90). Within facies B, samples with flow on the bedding plane (Z) were found to have the lowest conductivity. The findings of this study provide useful information to understand the outcomes of fracture stimulation in Eagle Ford, and therefore to assist fracture treatment design. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting, as a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended reach horizontal wells. It was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore via multiple strategically-located injection nozzles. It has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation. Jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing. These hypotheses are currently being investigated to improve the design for more efficient stimulation treatments. We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency. The jetting experiments are conducted at a constant pressure with linear core-flood tests, where a stand-off distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core. At low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter-cake by mechanical actions. Jetting also creates wormholes in carbonate cores. The combination of mechanical and chemical reactions stimulates carbonate rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle. When the jetting velocity increases, the dissolution pattern changes. An isolated locally compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure. With the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome. We used Indiana and Winterset limestone rocks in the experiments. 15% HCl (by weight) at ambient temperature was used and the core dimensions were 4 inches in diameter and 16 inches in length. Various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered. The Winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the Indiana limestone cores. From the experimental results, the results of acid jetting from the two different rock samples are compared. The experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing regarding wormhole propagation once cavities are created. Jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results. Acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for Indiana limestone and Winterset limestone cores. The observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid stimulation jobs. "

                    "abstract": "Acid fracturing is one of the methods for well stimulation in carbonate formations. Compared to propped hydraulic fracturing, acid fracturing takes a simpler procedure, and therefore, usually with a lower cost. On the other hand, fracture conductivity is more difficult to maintain, especially in formations that have high closure stress. In this study, a procedure is developed to evaluate the feasibility of acid fracturing by comparing conductivity generated from an unpropped fracture, a propped fracture and acid fracture. The target formation features extreme closure stress and low permeability at a depth of 5000-7000 meters. The efficiency of acid fracturing is challenged by the severe condition of the formation. The laboratory experiments were performed using the core samples from three wells from the productive interval of the target reservoir. The acid fracturing treatment conditions that have been used in the field were simulated during the laboratory experiments. The fracture conductivity was measured for un-propped, acid-etched, and propped fractures at different closure stresses using an apparatus consisting of a modified API conductivity cell and a load frame The fracture face surface of the intact and acidized core samples was scanned with a profilometer to characterize the change in surface profile to calculate the volume of dissolved rock caused by acid etching, and the initial fracture conductivity under zero closure stress. Conductivity decline as a function of closure stress was recorded and examined during the study. The results of the comparative study on fracture conductivities showed that the final propped fracture conductivity was higher than the acid fracture conductivity for all of the core samples. Also, the rate of conductivity decline with increasing closure stress was lower for the propped fracture conductivity compared to the acid fracture conductivity. The conclusion was made that the propped hydraulic fractures would retain a greater conductivity under the formation closure stress compared to the acid fractures. Hence, the hydraulic fracturing with proppant would be a more effective stimulation treatment compared to the acid fracturing for improving the wells productivity for the studied reservoir. "

                    "abstract": "Shale fracture conductivity can be reduced significantly by shale/water interactions. Factors that may influence shale fracture conductivity include shale mineralogy, proppant embedment, shale-fines migration, proppant-fines migration, brine concentration, longer-term stress application, and residual water in the fracture. The study of excessive proppant embedment has been reported in our previous work (Zhang et al. 2014a). This paper presents the studies of the remainder of these factors. Laboratory experiments were run to understand each of these factors. To study the effect of rock mineralogy, recovered fracture conductivities after water damage were measured for Barnett shale, Eagle Ford shale, and Berea sandstone. During conductivity measurements, water-flow directions were switched to study the effect of shale-fines migration. The size of shale fines was measured by microscopic imaging techniques, and scanning-electron-microscope observations were also presented. Proppant-fines migration was examined by placing two colors of sand on each half of the fracture surface, and then a microscope was used to identify the migrated crushed sands of one sand color mixed in with the other sand color. Fresh water and 2% KCl were injected to study the effect of brine concentration. After water injection, the proppant pack was either fully dried or kept wet to investigate the damage caused by residual water. Results showed that clay content determines the fracture-conductivity damage caused by water. Fines generated from the shale fracture because of fracture-face spalling, slope instability, and clay dispersion can migrate inside the fracture and are responsible for 12 to 20% of the conductivity reduction. There is no evidence of crushed-proppant-particle migration in this study. Longer-term stress application accounts for a 20% reduction of the fracture conductivity. In the Barnett shale tests, further conductivity damage caused by fresh water after brine injection is not significant when initial conductivities are greater than 65 md-ft. Removal of the residual water from the fracture by evaporation helps to recover the fracture conductivity to a small extent. A theoretical model of propped-fracture conductivity was extended to include the effects of water damage on fracture conductivity. An empirical correlation for the damage effects in the Barnett shale was implemented in this model. "

                    "abstract": "Multi-stage acid fracturing in a tight carbonate formation can be an alternative to propped fracturing as a relatively cost-effective completion treatment. However the success of the treatment depends on many factors as to whether enough conductivity by acid etching has been created, and weather the selected chemical treatment has worked well in-situ under the specific geologic environment. Thus, observation and evaluation of past practice is important to develop further optimal stimulation procedures. In this paper, an integrated methodology to conduct performance evaluation of multi-stage acid fracturing treatment in a horizontal well is presented. The method is applied to a field case in Tarim Basin in China. The integrated procedure starts with obtaining closure pressure and the formation breakdown pressure. Bottomhole treating pressure is then estimated from surface treating pressure in cases if it is not measured directly. A treatment pressure history match is then conducted to estimate the fracture geometry using commercial software. A 3-D acid fracture conductivity profile is generated using the in-house acid fracture simulator. Then using the reservoir face pressure and the acid fracture conductivity profile obtained by the acid fracture simulator, the cross-sectional flowing area created by acid fracturing fluid is estimated using pressure transient analysis. Evolution of fracture extension and acid etching during the stimulation is calculated assuming a bilinear flow regime. After production starts, a linear flow diagnostic approach provides the cross-sectional area flowing that has the flow from the matrix. This enables us to compare flowing cross-sectional area with induced area by the stimulation, which is defined as treatment efficiency. A field application based on the proposed procedure shows the effectiveness of the approach. The integrated approach provides engineers with additional information as to whether the designed acid fracturing has been performed appropriately under high closure stress field. It is eventually helpful to discuss past practice and improve candidate selectivity in a company decision making process. "

                    "abstract": "Acid fracturing stimulation can be an effective means to improve well performance in carbonate formations. In general, a treatment consists of multiple stage injections alternating between acid and non-reacting fluid to better place acid, and therefore, to create sustainable conductivity for enhanced well productivity. Selecting appropriate fluid systems is critical in success of acid fracturing. To optimize acid fracturing design, an integrated approach is needed to model the fluid behavior inside of the fracture, the conductivity after fracturing, and the productivity of fractured wells. The integrated approach includes an acid transport model and a fracture propagation model. Theoretical models were developed to obtain the conductivity distribution and acid penetration distance inside fractures. Continuity and momentum balance equations are solved in three-dimensional space for pressure and velocity profiles. Once the velocity profile is generated, the acid balance equation can be solved for the acid concentration profile. Obtaining a concentration profile helps in calculating the amount of rock etched through diffusion and convection. Conductivity distribution is calculated using a correlation where statistical parameters are used to account for fracture heterogeneity. Finally, a reservoir simulator is used to predict the production performance from acid fractured wells. Straight, emulsified, and gelled acid systems are examined using the integrated approach to capture the effect of each on fracture conductivity and acid penetration distance. Optimizing these two parameters will improve the production performance significantly. Straight acid reacts aggressively with carbonate formations and leaks off significantly more near the entrance of the fracture when compared with the other two acid systems. The apparent viscosities of gelled or emulsified acids are substantially higher than that of straight acid, and the diffusion coefficients of these viscous fluids are substantially lower than that of straight acid. These properties result in deeper penetration down the fracture with gelled or emulsified acids, but also less fracture etching by acid near the well. The tradeoff between deeper penetration with viscosified acid systems versus more near well etching with less viscous systems means that the acid formulation can be optimized depending primarily on the formation permeability. Production analysis of these three acid systems suggests that emulsified acid is better used in tight formations. Gelled acid, on the other hand, results in the highest production rate when used in relatively high to medium permeability formations. Straight acid is the preferred system only when short, highly conductive fractures are desired. "

The main objective of hydraulic fracturing in shale is to create fracture networks with sufficient fracture conductivity. Due to the variation in shale mineralogical and mechanical properties, fracture conductivity damage mechanisms in shale formations are complex. Standard fracture conductivity measurement procedures developed for fractures with high proppant concentration had to be modified to measure the conductivity in fractures with low proppant concentration. Water-based fracturing fluids can interact with the clay minerals in shale and eventually impact shale fracture conductivity. All these challenges require more experimental studies to improve our understanding of realistic fracture conductivity in shale formations. The aims of this work were to design an experimental framework to measure fracture conductivity created by low concentration proppants and to investigate the mechanisms of conductivity damage by water. We first presented the laboratory procedures and experimental design that can accurately measure fracture conductivity of shale fractures at low concentrations of proppants. Then we measured the undamaged shale fracture conductivity by dry nitrogen. Water with similar flowback water compositions was injected to simulate the damage process followed by secondary gas flow to measure the recovered fracture conductivity after the water damage. This study shows that the developed laboratory procedures can be utilized to reproducibly measure shale fracture conductivity by both gas and liquid. The conductivity measurement of propped fractures by small size proppants at low concentrations requires strict control on gas flow bypassing the fracture both parallel and perpendicular to the fracture length direction. Shale fracture surface softening is identified as the dominant cause for the significant conductivity reduction after water flow. "

                    "abstract": "Shale fracture conductivity plays a critical role in determining the long term production of shale wells. High fracture conductivity is achieved by pumping more proppants and minimizing conductivity damage by fracturing fluid. Currently, fracture conductivity is either measured in laboratory following ISO 13503-5 or calculated using correlations derived from extensive laboratory tests by regression analysis. There is a need for a handy and practical tool to calculate shale fracture conductivity reflecting realistic fracturing designs. This paper presents a new correlation to calculate shale fracture conductivity that considers proppant properties, fracture design variables and formation mechanical properties. This correlation is based on the population balance equation for size reduction. It utilizes the population balance concept to predict the crushed proppant size distribution under increasing closure stress. Numerical solution of the integro-differential equation is validated by comparing the computed results with the measured data. The crushed grain size distribution determines the permeability of the sand pack. Fracture width is calculated separately by considering proppant embedment and proppant grain rearrangement. Fracture conductivity is then calculated and compared with laboratory measured conductivity. Finally, the effect of water damage to shale fracture conductivity is considered by bringing in a new modification term. Results show that the population balance equation can reasonably predict the crushed proppant size reduction by properly choosing the selection equation and breakage equation. The calculated shale fracture conductivity can match with the measured fracture conductivity using the Barnett Shale. An exponential expression can be used to account for the water damage effect in the Barnett Shale. "

Together, these two techniques help to create a fracture network, which act as fluid conduits from the reservoir to the wellbore. The efficacy of a fracturing treatment can be determined through fracture conductivity analysis. Fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width, and describes both how much and how easily fluid can flow through fractures. It is therefore directly related to well performance. The goal of this work is to explore fracture conductivity of Marcellus shale samples fractured in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The Marcellus shale, located primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, and Maryland, is the largest gas-bearing shale formation in North America, and its development has significant implications on regional economies, the energy infrastructure of northeast United States, and the availability of petrochemical plant feedstock. In this work, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the propped fracture conductivity of 23 different outcropsamples from Elimsport and Allenwood, Pennyslvania. Before conductivity measurements were taken, the pedigree of samples was verified through XRD analysis, elastic rock properties were measured and compared against literature values, and fracture surface contours were mapped and measured. Fracture conductivity of both horizontally and vertically-fracture samples was determined by measuring the pressure drop of nitrogen gas through a modified API conductivity cell. Results show that fracture conductivity varies as a function of fracture orientation only when anisotropy of the rock's mechanical properties is pronounced. It is hypothesized that the anisotropy of Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio play a significant role in fracture mechanics, and therefore in the width of hydraulically-induced fractures. Ultimately, the experiments conducted as part of this work show that fracture conductivity trends are strongly tied to both proppant concentration and the rock mechanical properties. "

The number of applications using DAS technology has been growing significantly from determining flow distribution to detecting multiphase flow. Some of the current DAS technology in the hydraulic fracture diagnosis area utilizes sound intensity on the spectrogram plot of the acoustic measurements to qualitatively analyze fracture initiation. In this paper, we present the results of our simulated fracture, perforation tunnel, and wellbore system experiments measured by a distributed hydrophone array in both the time and frequency domain. The experiments were conducted on a wellbore with two fracture cells. The wellbore can be either horizontal or vertical. The customized fracture cells with long and thin geometry were connected through a perforation tunnel to a 5-inch ID wellbore. In the horizontal wellbore setup, fluid was injected through the fracture cells and perforation tunnels to the wellbore. The experiments used hydrophone and microphone array to measure the acoustic signals from each fracture. Relative locations of the hydrophones to the fractures and the rate difference from the two fractures are the main parameters examined during the experiments. The measured acoustic data were analyzed using DSP techniques to characterize the location and rate differences. We first studied how the fracture and perforation tunnel alone affect the acoustic signature of the flow from the fracture to the wellbore; this study allows extraction of individual fracture and perforation related information from the overall measured DAS data from the combined system. We then analyzed how multiple perforation tunnels and different flow distributions changed the acoustic frequency spectrum. Additional parameters affecting acoustic behavior were investigated including single phase liquid, multiphase fluid, and liquid column. The digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm is explained in the paper. A correlation based on experimental observation was developed to quantitatively estimate the flow rate and flow distribution of multiple perforation tunnels from acoustic signals measured in the wellbore.

The fracturing design involves pumping low viscosity fluid with low proppant concentrations at high pump rate, commonly known as “slick water fracturing”. Direct laboratory measurement of natural and induced fracture conductivity under realistic conditions is needed for reliable well performance analysis and fracturing design optimization. During the course of this study a series of conductivity experiments was completed. The cementing material present on the surface of natural fractures was preserved during the initial unpropped conductivity tests. The induced fractures were artificially created by breaking the shale rock along the bedding plane to account for the effect of irregular fracture surfaces on conductivity. Proppants of various sizes were manually placed between rough fracture surfaces at realistic concentrations. The two sides of the induced fractures were cut in a way to represent either an aligned or a displaced fracture face with a 0.1 inch offset. The effect of proppant partial monolayer was also studied by placing proppants at ultra-low concentrations. Results from the experiments show that unpropped induced fractures can provide a conductive path after removal of free particles and debris generated when cracking the rock. Poorly cemented natural fractures are effective flow paths. Unpropped fracture conductivity depends strongly on the degree of shear displacement, the presence of shale flakes and particles, and the amount of cementing material removed. The propped fracture conductivity is weakly dependent on fracture surface roughness at higher proppant concentrations. Moreover, propped fracture conductivity increases with larger proppant size and higher concentration in the testing range of this study. Results also show that proppant partial monolayers cannot survive higher closure stresses. "

Reliable characterization of small-scale formation spatial heterogeneity by use of geostatistical analysis (i.e., variogram analysis) can improve prediction of acid-fracture conductivity significantly. Previous publications suggest that permeability correlation length can be used to assimilate spatial heterogeneity in prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. Well logs are good candidates to provide information about petrophysical and compositional properties of the formation with the required resolution for prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. However, the assessment of permeability and mineralogy from conventional well logs is challenging because of high spatial heterogeneity and complex pore structure. Rock typing has been suggested in the literature to improve permeability assessment in carbonates. Most of the previously introduced rock-typing methods are dependent on core measurements. However, core data are generally sparse and not available with the sampling rate required for prediction of acid-fracture conductivity. The main objective of this paper is to quantify formation spatial heterogeneity with variogram analysis of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties in carbonate reservoirs. We introduce an iterative permeability-assessment technique that is based on well logs, which takes into account characteristics of different rock classes in the reservoir. Furthermore, we propose three rock-classification techniques that are based on conventional well logs and that take into account static and dynamic petrophysical properties of the formation as well as mineral composition. We applied the proposed techniques successfully in two carbonate formations--Happy Spraberry oil field and Hugoton gas field. The petrophysical rock classification is in good agreement with identified core-derived rock classes. The results show approximately 54% improvement in permeability assessment compared with conventional permeability-assessment techniques, which can improve prediction of acid-stimulation jobs significantly. Finally, we investigated the direct application of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical and compositional properties for variogram analysis required to characterize formation spatial heterogeneity. We conducted variogram analysis in both field examples. The results show that the direct application of well logs and well-log-based estimates of petrophysical/compositional properties is reliable to characterize formation spatial heterogeneity. We also showed that application of well logs can enhance assessment of spatial heterogeneity compared with core measurements. "

                    "abstract": "Artificially created fracture networks with sufficient fracture conductivities are essential for economic production from shale reservoirs. Fracture conductivity can be significantly reduced in shale formations due to severe proppant embedment. In addition, proppant embedment induces shale flakes that migrate and clog fracture networks. A laboratory investigation was performed to understand how excessive proppant embedment caused by the shale–water interaction impairs shale fracture conductivity. The experiments were conducted using Barnett shale samples with representative rock properties. The asperities on the fracture surface were carefully preserved. The damage process was simulated in the laboratory by flowing water through the shale fracture packed with proppants. The water used in the experiments had a similar chemical composition to flowback water in the field. The laboratory results were benchmarked with the results from an experimental study conducted with Berea sandstone samples. Post experimental analysis included microscopic imaging of the fracture surfaces and measurement of the proppant embedment depth. A computational fluid dynamics study was conducted to quantify the conductivity loss due to proppant embedment on a theoretical basis. We developed pore-scale physical models of the proppant pack and calculated the fracture conductivity loss at different proppant embedment depths. The computation was repeated for a variety of proppant layers. The worst case assumed a 40% proppant grain volume embedment. The experimental study showed up to 88% reduction in fracture conductivity after water flow under 4000 psi closure stress. The conductivity loss was due to severe proppant embedment as the shale fracture face was softened after its exposure to water. Direct measurement of embedment depths indicated that for fractures that were exposed to water, the average embedment depth was about 50% of the proppant median diameter, while for fractures that were only exposed to gas, the average embedment depth was just 15% of the proppant median diameter. It was also observed that pore space of the sand grains at the outlet of the fracture was clogged by shale flakes and fragments. The computational fluid dynamics study proved that even a 10% proppant grain volume embedment can cause 45–80% conductivity loss. With the same proppant volume loss due to embedment, the conductivity reduction was less in fractures containing multiple proppant layers than the fracture containing only one layer of proppants. "

                    "abstract": "Determination of optimal acidizing conditions through laboratory experimental study is crucial for designing matrix acid stimulation jobs in the field. Optimal interstitial velocity, vi-opt (the velocity of injected fluid that yields the minimum volume of acid needed to propagate wormholes) can be determined though curve fitting of experimental data. This optimal interstitial velocity coincides with the minimum volume of acid required for wormhole breakthrough, and therefore, the most efficient stimulation design. Optimal interstitial velocity determines the injection rate for a treatment, and the optimal pore volume to breakthroughbreakthrough of pore volume, PVbt-opt, suggests the total volume of acid needed for a treatment. Studies of carbonate matrix acidizing have focused on the role of many parameters, such as acid concentration, acid type, temperature, and core dimensions. However, under the same experimental conditions, different limestone rocks exhibit different optimal conditions. It is important to explore how changes in rock properties, such as permeability and pore structure, can also impact the efficacy of matrix acidizing techniques. In this work, a series of linear core-flood experiments on relative homogenous Indiana limestone and Desert Rose limestone cores were performed at ambient temperature. Cores of 1.5-in. diameter by 8-in. long were acidized using 15% hydrochloric acid. The average permeabilities of the cores tested were 6, 11, 33 and 239 mD with varied porosity. To help understand the effect of permeability on the wormholing process, thin sections were analyzed to characterize the pore structure. Based on experimental results, a detailed explanation of the pore structure and permeability effects on optimal interstitial velocity is presented. The core-flood acidizing results show that at low permeabilities, high permeability rocks exhibit higher optimal interstitial velocities. When permeability of the rock reaches a certain value, the effect of permeability on the optimal injection condition diminishes. The implications and applications of this work are far-reaching; better understanding of optimal acidizing conditions based on the studied rock properties has significant potential economic and operational impact.

                    "abstract": "Gas flow in shale gas reservoirs occurs primarily from ultra low permeability shale rocks through a complex network of natural and induced hydraulic fractures. Consequently, fracture parameters (conductivity and half length), fracture location and distribution are the dominant factors influencing well drainage volumes and shale gas well performance. Stimulated reservoir volume or SRV, estimated from microseismic event clouds or rate/pressure transient analysis, describes a measurement of overall reservoir volume impacted by fracture treatments. With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement. In this paper, we first introduce a novel approach for computing well drainage volume for shale gas wells with multistage fractures and fracture clusters. Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated. The proposed approach has been applied to a generic shale gas well designed after a real field case. The results clearly indicate the benefits of including SRV during history matching, leading to improved fracture/matrix parameter estimation and performance forecasting. Our proposed approach provides an important tool that can be used to optimize well placement, fracture treatments and improve the economics of shale gas plays. "

                    "abstract": "Shale fracture conductivity can be reduced significantly due to shale-water interactions. Factors that may influence shale fracture conductivity include shale mineralogy, proppant embedment, shale fines migration, proppant fines migration, brine concentration, longer term rock creep, and residual water in the fracture. The study of excessive proppant embedment has been reported in our previous work (SPE 170775). This paper presents the study of the rest of these factors. Laboratory experiments were run to understand each of these factors. To study the effect of rock mineralogy, recovered fracture conductivities after water damage for the Barnett Shale, the Eagle Ford Shale, and Berea Sandstone were measured. During conductivity measurements, water flow directions were switched to study the effect of shale fines migration. The size of shale fines was measured by microscopic imaging techniques, and Scanning Electron Microscopic observations were also presented. Proppant fines migration was examined by placing two colors of sands on each half of the fracture surface and a microscope was used to identify the migrated crushed sands of one color mixed in the other color sand. Fresh water and 2% KCl were injected to study the effect of brine concentration. After water injection, the proppant pack was either fully dried or kept wet to investigate the damage by residual water. Results showed that clay content determines the fracture conductivity damage by water. Fines generated from the shale fracture due to fracture face spalling, slope instability, and clay dispersion can migrate inside the fracture and are responsible for approximately 20% of the conductivity reduction. There is no evidence of crushed proppant particle migration in this study. Longer term rock creep accounts for a 20% reduction of the fracture conductivity. Fresh water does not further damage the fracture conductivity when initial conductivities are above 65 md-ft. Removal of the residual water from the fracture by evaporation helps recover the fracture conductivity to a small extent. A theoretical model of propped fracture conductivity was extended to include the effects of water damage on fracture conductivity. An empirical correlation for the damage effects in the Barnett shale was implemented in this model. "

The success of these treatments is highly reliant on the created fracture conductivity. Optimizing fracture designs to improve well performance requires knowledge of how fracture conductivity is affected by rock and proppant characteristics. This study investigates the relationship between rock characteristics and laboratory measurements of propped and unpropped fracture conductivity of outcrop sample from the Eagle Ford shale and the Fayetteville shale. Triaxial compression tests were performed on core specimens in order to determine the Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio of the outcrop samples. Profilometer surface scans were also performed to characterize the fracture topography. The results from this study show that the main factors affecting fracture conductivity are closure stress and proppant characteristics (concentration, size, and strength). For unpropped fractures, the fracture topography is the main factor in determining fracture conductivity. The topography interaction of the two surfaces determines the fracture width. Higher Young’s Modulus helps maintain fracture width by resisting deformation as closure stress increases compared with lower Young’s Modulus. For propped fractures, the more influential factor in determining fracture conductivity is proppant characteristics (concentration, size, and strength). At a proppant monolayer placement, the major mechanism for conductivity loss is proppant embedment, leading to decreased fracture width. A higher Young’s Modulus reduces the proppant embedment and better maintains fracture conductivity as closure stress increases. For a multilayer proppant pack concentration, the effect of rock characteristics is negligible compared to the effect of proppant pack characteristics. "

                    "abstract": "The purpose of matrix stimulation in carbonate reservoirs is to bypass damaged areas and increase the effective wellbore area. This can be achieved by creating highly conductive flow channels known as wormholes. A further injection of the acid will follow a wormhole path where the permeability has increased significantly, leaving substantial intervals untreated. This problem can be more significant as the contrast in permeability increases within the target zones. Diverting materials, such as viscoelastic-surfactants (VES) -based acids, play an important role in mitigating this problem. The acid-injection rate was found to be a critical parameter to maximize the efficiency of the use of VES-based acids as a diverting chemical in addition to creating wormholes. It was found that the maximum apparent viscosity, which developed during VES-based acids injection, occurred over a narrow window of acid-injection rates. Higher injection rates were not effective in enhancing the acidizing process, and the use of diverting material became similar in effect to that of regular acids. The use of VES-based acid was also found to be constrained by the scale of the initial permeability ratio. For initial permeability ratios greater than approximately 10, the diversion was insufficient. The results were obtained by conducting a large set of acidizing experiments by use of 20-in.-long cores. Both single- and parallel-coreflood experiments were performed in this study. Carbonate cores were used with initial permeabilities of 4–150 md, and the flow rate was varied from 1.5 to 50 cm3/min. The initial ratio of permeability between the two cores ranged from 2 to 15. To characterize the wormholes, computerized tomography (CT) was used to generate a 3D view of the wormholes in each core. By use of the results obtained from single cores, the acid-injection rate was found to be a critical parameter in maximizing the efficiency of the use of VES as a diverting agent during matrix-acidizing treatments. Higher injection rates were not effective in enhancing the acidizing process, and the use of diverting material produced results similar to those of regular hydrochloric acid (HCl). Parallel-coreflood experiments indicated that the use was found to be constrained by the scale of the initial permeability ratio. For initial permeability ratios greater than approximately 10, diversion was insufficient in 20-in. coreflood tests. For permeability ratios greater than 10, the acid-placement treatment needs to be designed more carefully. "

                    "abstract": "Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology is implemented to monitor downhole audible sounds for fracture diagnosis, leak detection and other applications. While DAS systems have the potential to enhance downhole flow monitoring, its use is currently limited to qualitative interpretation. Future applications of DAS such as distributed flow prediction require quantitative interpretation to determine flow rate, possibly of multiple phases, from acoustic data. In this paper we use signal processing techniques to determine flow rates from a simulated fractured well. Production into a 5 ½-inch well is simulated by injecting fluid into a fracture. The fracture was originally simulated with a piece of pipe filled with proppant, and then we used a pair of proppant-filled parallel plates with dimensions of 0.2 inch wide, eight inch high, and sixteen inch long, to represent a fracture. Liquid and gas were injected at varying rates into the fracture and into the well. The noise from production was recorded with a hydrophone within the wellbore. Through signal processing, the sound signal collected is transformed into the Fourier domain for insight into the sound spectrum. Experimental results show that frequency and sound intensity varies with the flow condition. The acoustic signal is sensitive to the flow rate and the type of fluid. The peak frequency indicates the phase of the fluid and its magnitude indicates the flow rate. The frequencies for gas production are in a range distinct from those for liquid production and the sound levels are related to the flow rate for both fluids.  Experimental results also show that fracture geometry has an effect on the sound that is generated and sound from production can be used to identify fractures with restricted widths. Background of Acoustic Sensing Technology The idea of using sound for well diagnosis, termed noise logging, started in 1955 through the work of Enright (1955). Noise logging started as a qualitative tool to determine where leaks and fluid movement occur in a well, however, experiments by McKinley et al. (1973) demonstrated that noise logging could be used as a quantitative tool. By recording sound at multiple points within the well a noise log is created. The sound recorded at these multiple points gives an indication of where fluid movement occurs as the sound is created by fluid turbulence. The high amplitude sounds indicate flow through a channel, leaks, flow from perforations or flow past the logging sonde (McKinley et al. 1979). In addition to traditional noise logging tools, sound in wellbores is currently sensed and recorded by Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems. These DAS systems are composed of a fiber optic cable and a laser source. As fluids flow in a wellbore, pressure waves propagate in the fluid and cause strains along the fiber optic cable. A light pulse, at a known rate and intensity, is sent through the fiber optic cable. When this light pulse reaches an area where the cable has been deformed by the acoustic pressure waves, the manner in which this pulse travels through the fiber optic cable changes and generates backscattered waves. Through signal processing, this backscattered light pulse gives an indication of where the acoustic pressure wave deforms the cable and gives a measurement of the sound occurring. This fiber optic cable that can sense acoustic pressure waves are installed along the length of the wellbore. By sending a light pulse through the fiber optic cable and analyzing modulated light pulses, it can determine where sound events occur and determine their intensity. The ability to determine where sound is being generated gives engineers the ability to determine leaks along a wellbore, and detect the locations of production from perforations or fractures, and the locations of injection during hydraulic fracturing; because all of these events and activities generate sound.

This paper aims to explore two different vertical intervals of the Fayetteville Shale, FL2 and FL3, by comparing laboratory fracture conductivity measurements. Fayetteville Shale outcrop cores were artificially fractured, preserving the surface roughness for the conductivity measurements. Controllable parameters, such as proppant size, concentration and type, were kept consistent between the two zones. An initial unpropped experiment was run, followed by two 30:70 mesh propped experiments at 0.03 lb/ft2 and 0.1 lb/ft2 concentrations. The FL2 consistently recorded higher conductivity values than the FL3 at closure stress up to 3,000 psi. Therefore, each zone was evaluated using mineralogical composition, thin-section analysis and surface-roughness scans to identify rock property differences. The FL2 and FL3 rock analysis identified that the two zones are very different. Although the FL2 and FL3 samples used in the conductivity experiments had similar clay content, the FL2 contained more quartz and the FL3 contained more carbonate. Additionally, the FL2 samples were less fissile and had larger surface fragments break along the fracture surface, whereas the FL3 samples broke parallel to the bedding plane and had flaky dust fragments break along the fracture surface. The FL2 had higher conductivity values at low closure stress due to the rearrangement of bulky surface fragments and larger voids created on the surface when fragments were lost. The difference between the FL2 and FL3 conductivity decreases as the concentration of proppant increases because the voids causing unpropped conductivity differences become filled with proppant. Finally, production data was used to confirm laboratory results by providing evidence that wells in the FL3 produce less than the wells in the FL2 formation. Introduction The Fayetteville Shale is an organic-rich shale formation that displays rock and fluid properties similar to the productive Barnett Shale in Texas. The initial completions in the field were nitrogen-assisted fracturing fluids, but were soon altered and by the end of 2006 the primary treatments were similar to Barnett Shale, using slick-water and cross-linked fracturing fluids. Today, slick-water fracturing treatments are the main completion method within the Fayetteville Shale field. Sand is used as the propping agent and 65,000 lbs per perforation cluster is required for most treatment designs (Harpel et al., 2012). Considering the high cost of hydraulic fracturing and large quantities of propping agent used in slick-water fracturing treatment, the selection of a fracturing fluid and propping agent is significant to well cost and production. The selection of both fracturing fluid and proppant depend on the formation. Therefore, understanding how fluids and proppants perform based on rock type, fabric, and mineralogical make-up is invaluable. There have been extensive studies done to better understand realistic fracture conductivity. Cooke (1973) developed a conductivity cell to aid in his study on the effect of high-temperature brine, non-Darcy flow and closure stress on fracture conductivity, concluding that each can reduce fracture conductivity. The conductivity cell used in his study is now the API conductivity cell. Continuing his study, Cooke (1975) investigated the effect of fracturing fluid where he found that the residue from guar polymer can cause conductivity damage and factors such as proppant concentration, residue of the fracturing fluid and porosity of the proppant, determine the conductivity reduction. After Cooke’s initial studies, other works further evaluated other fracture conductivity damage mechanisms such as elevated stress, temperature, fracturing fluid filter cake and fluid additives. "

                    "abstract": "Predicating the conductivity of acid fracture is not possible using analytical or numerical models due to stochastic nature of acid reaction with rock and complex leak-off behavior of acid. Other alternatives are either empirical correlations or conducting experiments mimicking field treatments. We adopted experimental approach considering scaling down of field conditions to laboratory scale by matching Reynold’s number to represents flow along the facture and acid leak-off through fracture faces, and Pecelt number to represent acid transport to fracture walls. Experiments conducted comprise three stages: dynamic etching, surface characterization of etched cores and conductivity measurement. One objective of this work is to understand mechanism through which conductivity is generated in acid fracturing treatment. Moreover, the effect of initial condition of fracture surfaces on conductivity was investigated to quantify the difference between rough-walled and smooth-walled fractures. Another area of interest is the variation of conductivity along the fracture due to acid spending. In previous works, experiments only represented fracture entrance of actual treatment neglecting that acid is spent along the fracture which affects conductivity. Therefore, to better predicate the performance of an acid fracture, experiments at different acid concentrations representing different positions along the fracture were conducted. We also investigate effect of contact time, acid system type and treatment temperature on conductivity using San Andres Dolomite cores. Preliminary results showed that initial condition of fracture surface has a major influence on fracture conductivity where rough-walled fracture predicted higher conductivity by almost an order of magnitude compared to smooth-walled. And mechanism through which conductivity created is by smoothing peaks and valleys creating surfaces mismatch rather than creating asperities. Furthermore, results showed that acid spending does not necessarily cause a decrease in conductivity from entrance toward the tip of a fracture. Also, cross-linked acid is more effective in terms of dissolving rock and controlling fluid leak-off compared to linear gelled acid. Furthermore, more etching does not always translate to higher conductivity suggesting the existence of optimum contact time. Results obtained provide new insights to better understand and predicate conductivity of acid fracture and suggest guidelines to optimize treatment design. "

During the last decade, much progress has been made to determine the factors that affect the optimal conditions in linear coreflood experiments, including the temperature, acid type, and acid concentration. However, little work has focused on the effects of the core dimensions, although a core-size dependence has already been observed. It has been shown that for a fixed core diameter, the Vi-opt increases with increasing core length, but it is not clear if the Vi-opt can be independent of the core length when the core length reaches a certain value. In this work, we conducted a series of coreflood experiments with Indiana limestone cores at room temperature.

To quantify the cost and benefit of a particular acid fracture treatment an engineer must predict the resulting fracture’s conductivity distribution. Current practice is to estimate conductivity distribution utilizing two-dimensional models. Unfortunately, these models can misrepresent the amount of acid etching upon which the conductivity estimation is based. A new modeling tool has been developed to estimate fracture conductivity and is used to evaluate different acid fracture treatment designs. The tool uses three-dimensional flow simulation to resolve acid transport in a fracture. This approach includes resolution of the three-dimensional fluid velocity throughout the fracture, fluid pressure, the acid concentration profile, and the acid-etched width. By using a fine grid in the direction of transport to the fracture surfaces, convective and diffusive transport of acid to the fracture surfaces are modeled. The acid-etched width distribution and other formation information are used to calculate the resulting conductivity distributions for different treatment designs. The output acid-etched width and conductivity distributions for different acid fluid systems, fracture geometries, geologies, and completion designs are calculated. The industry lacks a reliable tool for acid fracture treatment design. The modeling tool presented in this paper attempts to address this problem with rigorous simulation of acid transport and etching in a fracture.

This research aims to quantify the small scale heterogeneity by using a geostatistical description to ascertain the distribution of permeability in a carbonate formation. Parameters that quantify the directional correlation and variance of the data are developed. The correlation length and variance parameters are a first step in being able to couple acid transport and rock dissolution models at reservoir scale with a model of fracture conductivity based on channels and roughness features caused by small scale heterogeneity. These geostatistical parameters are developed for a well in the Hugoton Field. Data leading to their derivation are obtained from a combination of well logs and cores.

The diversion methods are categorized into chemical diversion and mechanical diversion. In this study, we focus on one of the classical mechanical-diversion methods, ball sealers. Ball-sealer diversion is used in cased and perforated wells to divert stimulation fluids by temporarily blocking perforation holes in the casing with rubber-coated balls. This diversion method can be very effective, particularly with highrate injection, but no general methodology is available to design ball-sealer diversion, or to evaluate its effectiveness from the treating rate and pressure record. Although some design methodologies, such as the use of buoyant ball sealers to improve the ball-sealer efficiency, have been suggested, no model has been presented for determining how many balls seat on the perforations. In this paper, experimental data from an extensive series of full-scale flow experiments conducted by Bern (1993) and Bern and Lewis (1992a, b) were analyzed. We summarized several features of the ball sealers which are not presented in the literature. Also we used the procedure presented by Brown et al.

However, the seating process was found to still be statistical. We developed an empirical correlation for ball-sealer performance on the basis of the experiments. We also analyzed one field acid-fracturing treatment where ball sealers were used as a diversion method. The analyzed data were then compared to the experimental results. A similar trend in seating behavior was observed. "

These data have always been enlightening, but the current trends are more than enlightening, they are cause for concern. Fueled by the strong demand for petroleum engineering graduates at all degree levels for the past several years, petroleum engineering enrollment in the US, particularly at the undergraduate level, is increasing in a manner similar to the period between 1976 and 1982. The enrollment data in Fig. 1 is alarming, and each university needs to understand the industry situation to determine its proper course of action. In our opinion, engineering departments cannot continue increasing enrollment at the current rate or they most likely will experience a sudden decline, as they did in the mid-1980s. At some point in the near future, enrollment needs to level off and grow at a much lower rate, if at all. Those of us who have been in the business since the 1970s remember the enrollment “mountain” shown in Fig. 1 that peaked in 1984. For those of us in academia, the most significant part of this mountain was the incredibly fast rate at which enrollment declined, causing considerable stress in all departments and the closures of some departments. For petroleum engineering students graduating in those years, the implications were dire, for there were no jobs in the industry for a large number of them. A closer examination of the past few years helps to understand where the growth is occurring. Fig. 2 shows bachelor of science degree enrollments in petroleum engineering departments in the US. Of particular interest is the change that has occurred in just the past year. "

                    "abstract": "Optimum fluid placement is crucial for successful acid-stimulation treatments of long horizontal wells where there is a broad variation of reservoir properties along the wellbore. Various methods have been developed and applied in the field to determine the fluid placement and effectiveness of the diversion process, but determining the injection profile during the course of matrix acidizing still remains a challenge. Recently, distributed temperature-sensing (DTS) technology has enabled us to observe the dynamic temperature profile along the wellbore during acid treatments. Quantitative interpretation of dynamic temperature data can provide an invaluable tool to assess the effectiveness of the treatment as well as optimize the treatment through on-the-fly modification of the treatment parameters such as volume, injection rate, and diversion method. In this paper, we discuss how fluid placement can be quantified using dynamic temperature data. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the temperature behavior along the wellbore during and shortly after acid treatments. This model couples a wellbore and a near-wellbore flow and thermal model considering the effect of both mass and heat transfer between the wellbore and the formation. The model accounts for all significant thermal processes involved during a treatment, including heat of reaction, conduction, and convection. Then, an inversion procedure is applied to interpret the acid-distribution profile from the measured temperature profiles. To illustrate how to apply the model and analyze the DTS data, examples of matrix acidizing are presented. The temperature, flow, and pressure data were generated by a horizontal well-acidizing simulator. The inverse model is verified, and the effect of the distribution of stimulation fluid along the lateral and the effectiveness of the diversion processes on the transient temperature response is also discussed. We address some issues regarding solving the inverse problem and discuss the alternative methods of using warm-back information for cases in which inversion is difficult. "

The model simulates acid transport and fracture face dissolution. The acid transport model includes the non-Newtonian characteristics of most acid fracturing fluids, the solution of the 3D velocity and pressure fields, and diffusion of acid toward the fracture surface. The acid reaction algorithm permits live acid to leakoff and react within the rock matrix, forming wormholes that update the leakoff boundary condition for each time step. The acid fracture model utilizes commercial 3D fracture propagation software to define the physical domain of the acid fracture simulation. The performance of an acid fracturing treatment is quantified with conductivity, which is strongly dependent on the etched width created by the acid. The model numerically solves equations describing 3D acid transport and reaction within a fracture to yield the etched width created by acid along the fracture. This conductivity is calculated with the simulator derived acid-etched width, using correlations recently developed that reflect the small scale heterogeneity of carbonate rock as it creates etching along the fracture surface.

                    "abstract": "Fracture fluid damage caused by residual polymer gel in propped fractures results in low fracture conductivity and short effective fracture length, sometimes severely reducing the productivity of a hydraulically fractured well. The residual gels are concentrated in the filter cakes built on the fracture walls and have much higher polymer concentration than the original gel. The residual gel exhibits a higher yield stress and is difficult to remove after fracture closure. In this work we studied polymer gel behavior theoretically and experimentally in hydraulic fracturing. We developed a model to describe the flow behavior of residual polymer gel being displaced by gas in parallel plates. We developed analytical models for gas/liquid two-phase stratified flow of Newtonian gas and non-Newtonian residual gel to investigate gel cleanup under different conditions. The concentrated gel in the filter cake was modeled as a Herschel-Buckley fluid, a shear-thinning fluid following a power law relationship, but also having a yield stress. The model developed shows that three flow regimes may exist in a slot, depending on the gas flow rate and the filter-cake yield stress. At low gas velocities, the filter cake will be completely immobile. At higher gas velocity, the shear at the fracture wall exceeds the yield stress of the filter cake, and the gel is mobile, but with a plug flow region of constant velocity near the gas/gel interface. Finally, at high enough gas velocity, a fully developed velocity field in the gel is created. The parameters for the gel displacement model were evaluated by experiments. We examined the filter-cake formation by pumping the fracture fluid through a conductivity cell, allowing leakoff to build the filter cake, measuring the cake thickness, and flowing gas through the cell to simulate the cleanup process. The results show that the yield stress of the residual gel plays a critical role in gel cleanup. "

For vertical wells, we have focused on diagnosing the volume of acid placed in each zone from the flowback temperature history. During the flowback period, the zones that have taken more acid volume will show more heating because of reaction and will have higher temperature when entering the wellbore. This provides a mechanism to quantitatively determine the acid distribution.

In this study, we modeled the deformation of the rough fracture surfaces acidized in heterogeneous formations based on the synthetic permeability distributions and developed a new correlation to calculate the acid-etched fracture conductivity. In our previous work, we modeled the dissolution of the fracture surfaces in formations having small-scale heterogeneities in permeability. The characterization of the correlated permeability fields of rock includes the average permeability, normalized correlation lengths in both horizontal and vertical directions, and normalized standard deviation. These statistical parameters have a significant influence on the fracture-etching profiles obtained from the model. Beginning with this fracture-width distribution, we have modeled the deformation of the fracture surfaces as closure stress is applied to the fracture. The elastic properties of the rock, such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, have effects on the size of the spaces remaining open after fracture closure. After the model yields the width profile under closure stress, the overall conductivity of the fracture is then obtained by numerically modeling the flow through this heterogeneous system. In this paper, we introduce our models and investigate the effects of permeability and mineralogy distributions and rock elastic properties on the overall conductivity of an acid-etched fracture. A new acid-fracture conductivity correlation is developed on the basis of many numerical experiments. "

                    "abstract": "Successful acid stimulation of long-horizontal-well intervals in carbonate reservoirs requires effective acid distribution along the entire reservoir length. Such treatments also require large volumes of acid and seawater/brine injection at sufficiently high injection rates to drive the acid wormholes deep into the reservoir. Under these flowing conditions, significantly large tubing friction loss is anticipated unless optimal friction reducer performance in the tubing is maintained throughout the pumping operation. Because prediction of wormhole penetration and corresponding skin factor depends on analysis of downhole-injection pressures at the reservoir face, it is crucial to properly account for these hydrostatic and friction changes prior to evaluation of wormhole length and skin factor. In this study, an integrated flow model has been developed to predict the wellbore-pressure profile and wormhole distribution by tracking the movement of the acid in the wellbore and the formation. The wellbore-flow model is based on steady-state, 1D, pressure-based nodal method. The segmented wellbore in the reservoir interval is then coupled with analytical transient reservoir-flow models. The wormhole propagation in the formation is calculated based on the modified Buijse-Glasbergen correlation and upscaling model developed in our earlier work. The resultant wormholing skin factor is calculated by simulating and updating the changing well injectivity along the entire injection interval at every timestep. The model developed in this work is applicable for both fully completed wells (i.e., radial flow) and selectively completed perforation-cluster wells (i.e., spherical flow) typically employed in carbonate reservoirs. Analysis of injection rates and pressures during acid treatment provides engineers with a way to determine the varying injectivity and tubing friction as stimulation proceeds. The model presented here can be used as a forward model for analyzing real-time treatment rate and pressure histories and can also be used to review past treatments to improve future treatment designs. Using actual field-stimulation data, we also discuss key elements to successful stimulation planning and the diagnosis of matrix-acid treatments to achieve effective wormhole coverage for horizontal completions in carbonate formations.

                    "abstract": "Matrix-acidizing models have traditionally underpredicted acid-stimulation benefits because of underprediction of wormhole penetration and the corresponding magnitude of completion-skin factors in vertical wells. For long horizontal wells drilled in carbonate reservoirs, productivity enhancement is a function of acid placement and effective wormhole penetration. However, prediction of wormhole penetration requires more effective analysis than that provided by current industry models. This paper presents results of matrix-acid modeling work for horizontal wells and describes a practical engineering tool for analyzing the progress of matrix-acid stimulation in carbonate reservoirs. The wormhole-growth model is based on the Buijse and Glasbergen empirical correlation. Combining with the mechanistic model of the wormhole propagation based on acid transport and fluid loss from a single wormhole, a modified Buijse-Glasbergen wormhole-growth model is developed that relates the wormhole growth rate to the in-situ injection velocity at the tip of the dominant wormhole. The wormhole constitutive model developed in this study also accounts for core-size dependencies seen in laboratory acid-flood experiments. A semianalytical flow correlation is derived for estimating interstitial velocities at the tip of the dominant wormholes based on a number of 3D FEM simulation analyses, accounting for more realistic flow regimes (radial and spherical flow) typically observed in field application. The scaleup procedure developed in this study extends the wormhole geometry and penetration from laboratory flow tests on small cores to field-sized treatments. The scaleup procedure developed in this work can be applied to cemented and uncemented horizontal wells, including barefoot and perforation-cluster completions typically employed in carbonate reservoirs. Application of this modeling shows that acid wormholing through carbonate formations can provide significant stimulation, resulting in post-stimulation skins as low as -3.5 to -4.0 vs. previously predicted values in the -1.0 to -2.0 range.

This technology allows us to monitor and evaluate treatments and diversion methods in real-time from captured sequence of temperature profiles at different times during and after acid injection.

An inversion procedure was also included to interpret the acid distribution profile from the measured temperature data in a hypothetical example. In this paper, we apply our model to a field case. The well is a gas producers and was stimulated with acid treatments. The temperature data was measured with DTS tool during shut-in period, and shortly after each stage of the treatments. The model is used to quantify the acid distribution with the temperature data to evaluate the efficiency of acid treatments. We have focused on diagnosing the volume of acid placed in each zone with the shut-in temperature data. Results indicate that the model is applicable in the field operation for acid profiling and is helpful to evaluate and optimize acid treatments. Introduction In  carbonate formations, matrix acidizing is commonly applied to enhance well performance by removing the near-wellbore formation damage and creating wormholes inside the formation. For a successful acid stimulation treatment, placement of a sufficient volume of acid in all desired zones is critical. Particularly in thick, heterogeneous carbonate formations, acid distribution is a challenge for optimal stimulation results. Meanwhile, a variety of diversion methods are applied to evenly place the acid along the well, but the effectiveness of these diversion methods is generally only inferred from the rate and pressure behaviors during the treatment with high uncertainty. Therefore, diagnosis of acid flow profile has important impact on optimizing acid treatments and evaluating diversion results. Recently, distributed temperature sensing technology (DTS) has enabled us to observe dynamic temperature profiles along the wellbore during and after an acid treatment. These temperature profiles contain information related to formation properties, treatment effectiveness and acid distribution. It is possible to reveal the acid distribution from the interpretation of downhole temperature measurements.  Clanton et al. (2006) discussed the possibility of using a fiber-optic DTS system for real-time monitoring of acid stimulation treatments. Based on a qualitative analysis of the temperature data, they discussed the application of DTS for monitoring the acid front movement, volume of acid leaking off into the formation, cross flow during shut-in, and also evaluating the diversion effect during a treatment. Glasbergen et al. (2007 and 2009) discussed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of temperature data during an acid treatment by developing the tracer slug concept where we intentionally make a sequence of temperature disturbances and track the movement of a fluid slug. Applying this method, the velocity of the fluid slug in the wellbore and consequently the acid leakoff profile can be determined. However, there are some limitations of this tracer slug concept. To obtain the flow profile throughout a treatment, the method requires frequent change in the operation and a sequence of temperature disturbances needs to be created repeatedly. Meanwhile, the tracer slug may lose its temperature signature with time due to the heat transfer with surroundings. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this study we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the interactive effects of the key parameters that affect the final conductivity of a propped fracture, including flow back rate, proppant loading, polymer loading in the fracture fluid, the presence or absence of breaker, closure stress, and reservoir temperature. Fracture conductivity for conditions representative of field conditions was measured using a dynamic fracture conductivity testing procedure in which a fracture fluid/proppant slurry was pumped through a fracture conductivity cell, and then shut in and closure stress applied. Water-saturated gas was flowed through the fracture for a period of time at each closure stress to mimic gas flow back during the early stages of production. In all experiments, the proppant used was 30/50 mesh ceramic proppant. We used a fractional factorial design methodology to determine the relative importance of the fracturing parameters varied. The fractional factorial design method examines the combined effects on conductivity of potentially interacting parameters, while minimizing the number of experimental runs required.  The effects of the investigated factors arranged in order of decreasing impact on conductivity are closure stress, temperature, flow back rate, polymer loading, proppant concentration and presence of breaker. Increases in closure stress, flow back rate, temperature and polymer loading were observed to have deleterious effects on fracture conductivity. In particular, at high closure stresses and high temperatures, fracture conductivity was severely reduced due to the formation of a dense proppant-polymer cake. Dehydration of the residual gel in the fracture appears to cause severe damage to the proppant conductivity at higher temperatures. Also, at low proppant concentrations, there is the increased likelihood of the formation of channels resulting in high fracture conductivities.  Introduction Wells in low and ultralow permeability reservoirs are routinely fractured to ensure optimum productivity. A key determinant of the scale of the expected productivity increase is the final conductivity of the proppant pack. Factors that contribute to the deterioration of the conductivity of the proppant pack include but are not limited to proppant crushing, two-phase flow, formation of polymeric filter cake on the walls of the fracture, and gel damage (Wang et al. 2010). Deterioration of the conductivity of the proppant pack leads to negative impact on well performance.  Laboratory conductivity tests are often used as a benchmark to estimate the conductivity of hydraulic fractures. This is not a recent development in the petroleum industry. Cooke (1973) investigated the effect of temperature and closure stress on the conductivity of vertical fractures packed with several layers of brittle proppant in a conductivity cell. His results indicated that for the systems he investigated, better conductivities are derived when the treatment fluid is oil-based. Also, fracture conductivity has an inverse relationship with closure stress (for all fluids tested) and temperature (just for brine). Non-Darcy flow is also important, especially at high gas flow rates. It was observed that both polymer and proppant concentrations in the fracture after closure will be markedly different from the initial injected concentrations. Cooke (1975) developed theoretical models to compute the pore volume of propped fracture without residue, reduction of the pore volume by fracturing fluid residue—amount of residue depends on polymer and breaker loading, and the effect of the residue on fracture conductivity. Residue from guar-based fluids was seen as very detrimental to fracture conductivity. The presence of fluid-loss additives had negligible effect. Other factors that affect the magnitude of conductivity reduction include proppant concentration, porosity of the proppant pack, and the fraction of the residue resident in the fracture after leak off (Cooke 1975).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Ultra-deepwater reservoirs are important unconventional reservoirs that have the potential to produce billions of barrels of hydrocarbons, and are usually high pressure and high temperature with relatively high permeability. One major challenge of an unconventional, ultra-deepwater reservoir is pumping an effective and robust fracture stimulation treatment. Hydraulic fracturing a high permeability reservoir (>100 md) can be different from hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations (<1 md) due to their difference in purpose. The main purpose of hydraulic fracturing a low permeability reservoir is to create a long, conductive path to enhance drainage area and ensure a commericially economic well. In a high permeability formation, hydraulic fracturing is predominantly used to bypass near wellbore formation damage, control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Such a treatment is achieved by pumping a short fracture packed with high proppant concentrations and may also aim at achieving enough fracture length to increase productivity especially when reservoir fluid viscosity is high. To pump such a job and ensure long term productivity from the fracture, understanding the behavior of the proppant pack is critical.  A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to study conductivity and fracture width with high proppant loading, high temperature and high pressure using a Cooke conductivity cell. In this study, proppant was manually placed between two core samples and fracture fluid was initially pumped through the proppant pack. Conductivity was subsequently measured by pumping oil through the manually placed proppant pack to displace the fracture fluid and simulate reservoir conditions; resulting fracture fluid clean-up and proppant pack performance were studied. High strength proppant, ideal for fracture stimulations with high closure stress, was used to study the effects of proppant fracture conductivity with different proppant loadings and closure stresses. Proppant crushing and fracture width were also measured and compared to proppant pack conductivity in certain cases.  Testing results while pumping oil through the proppant pack at reservoir conditions indicated almost immediate fracture fluid clean-up. Increasing proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values in some cases, while increasing the effective closure stress during an individual test resulted in a significant loss in conductivity for all cases. Additionally, fracture width decreased with increased effective closure stress and time. Tests were also run to study the effect of cyclic loading and showed further degradation in conductivity and width.  Introduction The decrease in conventional oil reserves combined with the increase in demand for hydrocarbons has led the industry to pursue the development of more unconventional reserves to fill the gap for demand. An unconventional reservoir contains oil and gas which usually requires a method of hydraulic fracture stimulation or horizontal drilling to achieve a commercially economic production rate. Oil and gas produced from shale gas, tight gas sands, oil shale, and deepwater wells are all examples of unconventional reservoirs. These types of reservoirs are what have become, and will remain the driving force for increased technology. "

                    "abstract": "Guar gum and its derivatives have been the most commonly used polymers to increase the viscosity of fracturing fluids. However, the conductivity of many fractures created with guar-based polymers is low because of residual unbroken polymer gel remaining in the fracture. This residue can cause permeability impairment in the proppant pack, resulting in low fracture conductivity and decreased effective fracture length. In this study, we experimentally evaluated two important aspects of the gel damage process--the thickness of the polymer-gel filter cake that is created as fracture-fluid filtrate leaks off into the formation and the yield stress of the concentrated polymer gel that accumulates in the fracture. The thickness of the filter cake created during the leakoff process was measured as a function of the polymer loading and the volume of leakoff. We created the filter cake following the procedure described by Ayoub et al. (2006) and then measured the filter-cake thickness with a precise laser profilometer. We found that the filter-cake thickness varied linearly with leakoff volume, meaning that the gel concentration factor is constant for this guar polymer fluid. The concentrated polymer filter cakes created by leakoff behave rheologically as Herschel-Bulkley fluids having a yield stress. The yield stress of this material is a critical parameter influencing whether the gel can be removed from the fracture. We measured the yield stress of borate-crosslinked guar polymer fracture fluids at concentrations up to 200 lbm/1,000 gals by use of a unique flat-plate device. The yield stresses of the polymer filter cakes were found to depend strongly on the concentration of both polymer and breaker. "

                    "abstract": "Because of irregular fracture surfaces caused by heterogeneities such as variations in local mineralogy and variations in leakoff behavior, we use a correlation to calculate fracture conductivity in acid fracturing. An acid-fracture-conductivity correlation consists of two parts: conductivity at zero closure stress and the rate of conductivity change with closure stress. Existing correlations do not consider the effect of variations in formation properties and were developed on the basis of laboratory experiments that use core samples with dimensions of only a few inches. On the other hand, acid-fracture simulators have grid sizes of several feet to tens of feet. Therefore, correlations should be scaled up properly when used in a fracture simulator. This paper presents new correlations to obtain the conductivity at zero closure stress. This conductivity can then be incorporated in acid-fracture-conductivity models that consider the effect of closure stress. In this study, an extensive numerical study was performed using an intermediate-scale acid-fracture model with total dimensions comparable to a gridblock size in an acid-fracturing simulator and grid sizes comparable to core-sample sizes used in laboratory acid-fracture-conductivity tests. In this model, the distributions of permeability and mineralogy along the fracture faces are geostatistically generated. The model generates fracture-surface-etching profiles as a function of acid contact time, from which we can obtain fracture-width distributions when the fracture surfaces have come in contact at low closure stress. We then calculate the fracture conductivity by solving for the flow rate through this irregular domain for a fixed dp across the domain. By analyzing the relationship between the fracture conductivity created and statistical properties of the permeability and mineralogy distributions, we developed new acid-fracture-conductivity correlations for low closure stress. These correlations can be used directly to better predict the primary coefficient in the widely used Nierode-Kruk (Nierode and Kruk 1973) correlation of acid-fracture conductivity. This work allows the Nierode-Kruk (N-K) correlation to be scaled up to the dimensions appropriate for use in an acid-fracturing simulator. "

In this study, we have modeled the deformation of the irregular fracture surfaces created by acid etching and the resulting fracture conductivity as closure stress is applied to the fracture. In our previous work, we modeled the dissolution of the fracture surfaces in a formation having small-scale heterogeneities in both permeability and mineralogy. This model yielded the geometry of the etched fracture at zero closure stress. Beginning with this profile of fracture width, we have modeled the deformation of the fracture surfaces as closure stress is applied to the fracture. At any cross section along the fracture, we approximate the fracture shape as being a series of elliptical openings. Assuming elastic behavior of the rock, we calculate how many elliptical gaps remain open and their sizes as a function of the applied stress. The sections of the fracture that are closed are assigned a conductivity because of small-scale roughness features using a correlation obtained from laboratory measurements of acid-fracture conductivity as a function of closure stress. The overall conductivity of the fracture is then obtained by numerically modeling the flow through this heterogeneous system. Our previous work shows that high fracture conductivity can be created in acid fracturing if heterogeneity of the rock leads to the formation of channels along the fracture surfaces. In this study, we have determined how the channels in acid fracturing remain open as closure stress is applied.

This would cause reduction of relative permeability to gas, especially in tight gas wells. Capillary forces are the key parameters that affect the trapping of spent acid in the formation. This work provides a comprehensive study of the effect of acid additives in spent acid on surface tension in tight gas carbonates. All experiments were conducted using Drop Shape Analysis (DSA) at high temperature and pressure. Different types of commonly used acid additives including corrosion inhibitors, iron control agents, mutual solvents, methanol, acetic acid and formic acids were tested at different concentrations. Experiments were conducted at 1000 psi and temperature ranging from 25 to 150 °C. Acid additives such as methanol and corrosion inhibitors reduced surface tension. However iron control agents, formic and acetic acids had no impact on surface tension. In addition, increasing temperature resulted in reduction of surface tension. A unique feature of this work is that measurements were conducted at high temperature and pressure. This work contributes to the knowledge of surface tension behavior of different acid additives. Consequently, that would help in better designing the acid formulae used to enhance well productivity by minimizing capillary forces.  Introduction Acidizing with hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a common practice to remove the damage as a result of drilling and completion operations, and to enhance well productivity in carbonate rocks. Acid dissolves the rock and forms large channels known as wormholes. Spent acid which is mainly water and salt, produced from the reaction between acid and rock, goes in deeper beyond the wormhole zone. A significant amount of spent acid is usually trapped by strong capillary forces after acidizing in near-wellbore region beyond the stimulated zone. The accumulation of spent acid, also known as water blockage, in this region causes a reduction in gas relative permeability and consequently results in curtailed gas production. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Optimum fluid placement is crucial for successful acid stimulation treatments of long horizontal wells where there is a broad variation of reservoir properties along the wellbore. Various methods have been developed and applied in the field to determine the fluid placement and effectiveness of the diversion process, but determining the injection profile during the course of matrix acidizing still remains a challenge. Recently, distributed temperature sensing technology (DTS) has enabled us to observe the dynamic temperature profile along the wellbore during acid treatments. Quantitative interpretation of dynamic temperature data can provide an invaluable tool to assess the effectiveness of the treatment as well as optimize the treatment through on-the-fly modification of the treatment parameters such as volume, injection rate and diversion method.  In this paper we discuss how fluid placement can be quantified using dynamic temperature data. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the temperature behavior along the wellbore during and shortly after acid treatments. This model couples a wellbore and a near-wellbore flow and thermal model considering the effect of both mass and heat transfer between the wellbore and the formation. The model accounts for all significant thermal processes involved during a treatment, including heat of reaction, conduction, convection. Then, an inversion procedure is applied to interpret the acid distribution profile from the measure temperature profiles.  To illustrate how to apply the model and analyze the DTS data, examples of matrix acidizing are presented. The temperature, flow and pressure data were generated by a horizontal well acidizing simulator. The inverse model is verified and also the effect of the distribution of stimulation fluid along the lateral and the effectiveness of the diversion processes on the transient temperature response is discussed. We address some issues regarding solving the inverse problem and discuss the alternative methods of using warm-back information for cases in which inversion is difficult.  Introduction Matrix acidizing is a common stimulation technique applied to remove near-wellbore formation damage and increase the natural permeability in both vertical and horizontal wells. It involves injecting acid solutions, usually hydrofluoric (HF) and/or hydrochloric (HCl) acids, into the formation to restore the original reservoir permeability through chemical reactions. In the matrix acidizing treatment, optimum fluid placement and damage removal is crucial for success, both for long horizontal wells where there is a broad variation of reservoir properties along the wellbore, and for vertical wells with multiple zones and/or extensive productive intervals. It is difficult to evaluate the placement of the stimulation fluid and damage removal in real-time during the course of the matrix acidizing of a horizontal well or a vertical well with multiple zones. Pre-job matrix acidizing simulators can provide a theoretical prediction of the acid injection distribution and damage removal with prediction performance based on the limited information about the formation properties that is going to be treated. However, during the stimulation treatments unpredictable downhole conditions can have significant impact on the results.  When treatment is completed, production logging tools and radioactive tracers sometimes are used to provide some valuable feedback about the effectiveness of the treatment. However, well intervention during the treatment is required to obtain this data. Also, the data is not available until the treatment is finished, which does not allow for real-time treatment monitoring and optimization. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Diversion methods are routinely used in both matrix acidizing and fracturing stimulation treatments. The diversion methods are categorized into chemical diversion and mechanical diversion. In this study, we focus on one of the classical mechanical diversion methods, ball sealers. Ball sealer diversion is used in cased and perforated wells to divert stimulation fluids by temporarily blocking perforation holes in the casing with rubber-coated balls. This diversion method can be very effective, particularly with high rate injection, but no general methodology is available to design ball sealer diversion, or to evaluate its effectiveness from the treating rate and pressure record.  Although some design methodologies, such as the use of buoyant ball sealers to improve the ball sealer efficiency, have been suggested, no model has been presented for determining how many balls seat on the perforations. In this paper, experimental data from an extensive series of full-scale flow experiments conducted by BP were analyzed. We summarized several features of the ball sealer which are not presented in the literature. Also we used the procedure presented by Brown et al. (1963) to evaluate statistical nature of the ball behavior in the BP's experimental results. The BP experiments were designed to minimize scatter of data. However, the seating process was found to be statistical.  Also we analyzed one field acid fracturing treatment where ball sealers were used as a diversion method. Then the analyzed data were compared to the BP experimental results. A similar trend in seating efficiency was observed.  Introduction Since ball sealers were introduced to the oil and gas industry in 1956, they have been extensively used in well stimulation to divert stimulation fluids into lower permeability or damaged zones (Kastrop 1956). Ball sealers are small rubber-coated balls. They are added to injection fluids, carried downhole, and seal perforation holes that accept larger quantities of stimulation fluids, distributing the stimulation fluids into lower injectivity zones. At early time, Brown et al. (1963) studied the factors affecting the performance of a ball sealer: inertial force, drag force on ball sealers through a perforation, the force tending to unseat ball sealers, and the force tending to hold ball sealers.  Most commonly, ball sealers are heavier than the carrier fluid, so that after the treatment they will fall into the rathole (Economides et al. 1994). However, those non-buoyant ball sealers often fail to provide satisfactory diversion effect (Stipp and Williford 1968; Webster et al. 1964) because of low injection rate and high perforation density (Bale 1984).  Erbstoesser (1980) conducted laboratory tests with ball sealers having various densities, and found that buoyant ball sealers provided higher seating efficiencies (the ratios of the total number of ball seated to the number of perforations) when compared to non-buoyant ball sealers, especially at low flow rates. From the tests, he also identified three other parameters of critical importance to ball sealer seating efficiency: flow rate through the perforations, flow rate past the perforations, and fluid viscosity. In addition, he presented case studies of buoyant ball sealer applications in acid fracturing treatments and matrix acidizing treatments. Bale (1984) also presented a case study which showed buoyant ball sealers were effective in matrix acidizing treatments in carbonate reservoirs in Saudi Arabia. High injection rate is necessary for buoyant ball sealer treatments to transport the buoyant ball sealers down the wellbore to the perforations.  Gabriel and Erbstoesser (1984) proposed a field-tested design methodology to optimize the diversion efficiency of buoyant ball sealers. They presented several methods of controlling ball sealers' movement inside the wellbore during and after the operations. Baylocq et al. (1999) presented a design procedure for hydraulic fracturing treatment with non-buoyant ball sealers.  Li et al. (2005) developed an integrated model to simulate a ball sealer transport in a wellbore. They used a Lagrangian particle tracking methodology with which ball sealers are tracked from the surface until they seat on the perforations. However, they did not combine their ball sealer model with any well stimulation simulator although they coupled it with a steady-state reservoir outflow equation. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Trapping of spent acid after acidizing job is a major problem in carbonate rocks. Spent acid needs to be fully mobilized and recovered in order to enhance gas production. Wettability of the rocks and capillary forces are the main reason behind fluid trapping in carbonate formations. These forces can be weakened by decreasing surface tension and increasing contact angle. Additives that are injected along with the acid can have an impact on changing the surface tension, contact angle and possibly the wettability of the rocks. Previously, separate studies were conducted on the effect of acid additives on contact angle and surface tension. However, there is still a need to investigate the overall impact of acid additives on these two parameters and wettability on the trapping of spent acid in the carbonate rocks.  In this paper, the full impact of two additives, formic acid and methanol, on trapping and wettability is investigated. Irreducible fluid saturation is compared before and after the exposure of rocks to spent acid. Formic acid decreased irreducible fluid saturation whereas methanol increased irreducible fluid saturation. Spontaneous water imbibition was conducted in each case to ensure that there is no permanent effect on rock wettability as a result of using these additives. It is very important to understand that the effect of various additives on wettability must be studied before any acid job, as their impact on wettability can consequently affect well productivity.  Introduction In carbonate rock acidizing, as the acid dissolves the rock to form wormholes, spent acid is produced and accumulates beyond the wormhole region. In tight gas reservoirs, the spent acid is usually trapped at the pore throats by strong capillary forces.

Both iron control agents showed no impact on contact angle at concentration of 0.3 wt.% while at the lower concentration of 0.03 wt.% they decreased contact angle. A study was also done on the effect of temperature on contact angle of spent acid. The results showed that increasing temperature up to 100 oC increased contact angle, while beyond this temperature contact angle was decreased.  This work would help to better understand the ability of acid additives in altering wettability of carbonate rocks, which would consequently result in better designing the acid formulae and enhancement in well productivity by minimizing capillary forces.  Introduction Acid stimulation with strong hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions is a common technique to increase well productivity in carbonate formations. When HCl acid is injected into the formation, the acid dissolves carbonate rocks and creates large channels known as wormholes. As a result of the reaction between HCl acid and carbonate rocks, spent acid forms and penetrates deeper beyond the stimulated region. A large amount of spent acid is usually trapped after acidizing in the wellbore region. The accumulation of spent acid or more specifically the water blockage in this region results in severe formation damage and ultimately loss of production.  Capillary forces are the main factor affecting the spent acid trapping in the formation.

                    "abstract": "Abstract In the Middle East, extended reach horizontal wells (on the order of 25,000 feet of horizontal displacement) are commonly acid stimulated by jetting acid out of drill pipe. The acid is jetted onto the face of the openhole wellbore as the drill pipe is withdrawn from the well. The jetting action helps to remove the drilling fluid filter cake and promote the acid to penetrate into the formation and form wormholes to stimulate the well. However, with very long sections of wellbore open to flow, the acid placement and subsequent wormhole distribution and penetration depths are uncertain.  We have modeled this process using a comprehensive model of acid placement and wormhole propagation in a horizontal well. We presume that the acid jetting tool removes the drilling mud filter cake, so that no filter cake exists between the end of the drill pipe and the toe of the well. Correspondingly, we assume that there is an intact, low-permeability filter cake on the borehole wall between the end of the drill pipe and the heel of the well. The drill pipe is modeled as being withdrawn from the well during the acid jetting treatment, as is done in practice.  The acidizing simulator predicts the distribution of acid and the depths of wormholes formed as functions of time and position during the acid jetting treatment. The model shows that the acid jetting process as typically applied in these wells preferentially stimulates the toe region of the horizontal well. Comparisons of the simulation predictions with published data for acid jetting treatments in such wells showed good general agreement. Based on the simulation study, we present recommendations for improved acid jetting treatment procedures to improve the distribution of acid injected into the formation.  Introduction The use of horizontal wells in oil exploration, development, and production operations has grown rapidly over the past 20 years, and now, the drilling technology is able to deliver ultra-long horizontal well designs. This technology can make non-profitable and marginal field discoveries worth developing. Completion methods and well intervention concepts are also more complicated that require more attention when long horizontal well type is chosen.  Several papers have been published showing that well completions and intervention methods including future well stimulation techniques are an important component in field development concept (Brink et al. 2010; Hoch et al. 2010; Ritchie et al. 2010). Those parameters will affect reservoir management scenario which also directly influences field economic performance.  In some typical laterally extensive low permeability chalk fields, such as Al Shaheen and Dan/Halfdan oil field (Hansen and Nederveen 2002; Lechner et al. 2009; Thomasen et al. 2005), matrix acidizing is considered as the most optimum stimulation treatment in a long horizontal well completion type. Their study clearly showed that low permeability and formation damage problems during the drilling process require an acidizing stimulation treatment prior to production.  However, a successful acid stimulation treatment in a long horizontal carbonate well requires proper acid placement along the entire wellbore and should promote extensive wormholes to overcome the damage and to enhance productivity. Coiled tubing that has been used for years to distribute the acid, unfortunately cannot reach the total depth. Two unique methods to distribute acid in long horizontal wells are Controlled Acid Jetting (CAJ) and acid jetting. A dynamic model, operational techniques, and stimulation result for the CAJ treatment method is available in several papers (Hansen and Nederveen 2002; Mogensen and Hansen 2007). "

In recent years, the increasing application of fiber-optic based distributed temperature sensors, either permanently installed in the well completion, or temporarily deployed, has provided a source for additional temperature profile data. In this paper, we present methodologies for interpreting numerous conditions in wells from temperature profiles. For each method, the underlying theory of the interpretation, and one or more field examples are presented. The most fundamental well property that can often be obtained from a temperature profile is the well's inflow profile - the locations and relative rates of inflow along the well. Simple analytical methods for interpreting the flow profiles of vertical oil producing wells are presented along with examples of this interpretation.  Another key application of temperature profile measurements, particularly for horizontal wells, is the location of water or gas entries in oil-producing wells. We will show how water or gas entries create temperature anomalies along horizontal wells caused by the differences in the Joule-Thomson coefficients of the different phases or by the water or gas source being from below or above the well depth, as in a coning situation. We illustrate how such water or gas inflows can be quantitatively identified by applying standard inversion methods to the measured temperature profiles, yielding the locations and rates of water or gas entries.  Another growing application of temperature profile measurements is the analysis of stimulation treatment (fracturing or acidizing) fluid placement. Temperature profiles measured during treatment pumping, during a flowback period, or after shut-in can be analyzed to determine the amount of stimulation fluid placed in different completed intervals along the well. A related analysis method using transient temperature profile measurements provides a means of determining layer properties of permeability, skin factor, and damage depth. This method can be applied before a stimulation treatment to aid the stimulation design, or post-job to evaluate treatment results.  Introduction The temperature profiles of wells have been measured ever since being first reported by Schlumberger et al. [1937]. Not long after this earliest work, temperature logs were being used to diagnose a variety of well conditions, including locating cement tops, locating gas entries into production wells, detecting channels behind casing, and locating lost circulation zones [Hill, 1990]. A temperature log is routinely included with virtually every production logging suite of logs, so temperature profile data is readily available. In addition to traditional temperature logs, since the 90's, distributed temperature sensors (DTS) have been deployed in wells, either as permanent installations, or temporarily. Several overviews of the fiber optic DTS systems have been presented, for example, Karaman et al. [1996], Carnahan et al. [1999], and Brown and Hartog [2002]. With these systems, the temperature profile of a well can be recorded repeatedly at short intervals of time. "

Recently, distributed temperature sensing technology has enabled us to observe dynamic temperature profiles along a wellbore during and after an acid treatment. This technology allows us to monitor and evaluate treatments in real-time by capturing a sequence of temperature profiles at different times and evaluating temperature response to acid injection.  We have developed mathematical models to simulate the temperature behavior along a wellbore, horizontal or vertical, during and shortly after an acid treatment. This approach couples a wellbore model and a near-wellbore thermal model considering the effects of both mass and heat transfer between the wellbore and the formation. The models account for all significant thermal processes involved during a treatment, including heat of reaction, conduction and convection. An inversion procedure is applied to interpret the acid distribution profiles from the measured temperature profiles.  For horizontal wells, the results indicate that the distribution of stimulation fluid along a lateral and the effectiveness of diversion processes during an acid treatment can be quantified in real-time using distributed temperature measurements. The model shows that the relative injectivities into different zones can be interpreted from the temperature response measured during injection. For vertical wells, we have focused on diagnosing the volume of acid placed in each zone from the flow back temperature history. During the flow back period, the zones that have taken more acid volume will show more heating because of reaction, and will have higher temperature when entering the wellbore. This provides a mechanism to quantitatively determine the acid distribution. The methods developed from this study can help to diagnose and optimize acidizing design, and improve the efficiency of acid stimulation.  Introduction For an acid stimulation treatment, optimum fluid placement is a key to success. If no diversion method is applied, the acid injection distribution is likely to be non-uniform both for horizontal wells where there is a broad variation of reservoir properties along the wellbore; and for vertical wells with multiple zones and/or extensive productive intervals. Diversion is usually applied to ensure a desired injection distribution; however, the performance of diversion is affected by many properties and operating parameters, therefore, cannot be evaluated easily during the treatment. It is extremely helpful to quantitatively determine the acid injection distribution along a wellbore in both vertical and horizontal wells for effective stimulation.  Recently, distributed temperature sensors (DTS) have been widely applied in the field to provide accurate and continuous downhole temperature measurements during the entire acid stimulation treatment (injection, shut-in and flow-back periods). This technology allows us to monitor and evaluate the treatment in real-time. Clanton et al. (2006) discussed the possibility of using a fiber-optic DTS system for real-time monitoring of acid stimulation treatments. Based on a qualitative analysis of the temperature data, they discussed the application of DTS for monitoring the acid front movement, volume of acid leaking off into the formation, cross flow during shut-in, and also evaluating the diversion effect during a treatment. Glasbergen et al. (2007 and 2009) discussed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of temperature data during an acid treatment by developing the tracer slug concept where we intentionally make a sequence of temperature disturbances and track the movement of a fluid slug. Applying this method, the velocity of the fluid slug in the wellbore and consequently the acid leakoff profile can be determined. As acidizing varies the injectivity of each zone as well as the acid leakoff profile, the acid profile determined by this method is the initial acid leakoff profile. Once the slug passes a particular zone, the amount of acid leaking off into this zone can no longer be determined. "

Stimulated reservoir volume or SRV, estimated from microseismic event clouds or rate/pressure transient analysis, describes a measurement of overall reservoir volume impacted by fracture treatments. With SRV as well as the dynamic production/pressure response, reservoir simulation models can be calibrated to actual well performance in shale gas reservoirs leading to improved understanding, forecasting and future well placement.  In this paper, we first introduce a novel approach for computing well drainage volume for shale gas wells with multistage fractures and fracture clusters. Next, we calibrate the shale gas reservoir model by matching the drainage volume with the SRV within specified confidence limits. The matching of the SRV is done in addition to the traditional history matching of production/pressure response and further constrains the estimation of fracture parameters. An evolutionary algorithm with design of experiments is used for the assisted history matching. Sensitivities to various parameters such as fracture conductivity, fracture half lengths and rock compaction have also been investigated. The proposed approach has been applied to a generic shale gas well designed after a real field case. The results clearly indicate the benefits of including SRV during history matching, leading to improved fracture/matrix parameter estimation and performance forecasting. Our proposed approach provides an important tool that can be used to optimize well placement, fracture treatments and improve the economics of shale gas plays.  Introduction The rise in the demand of natural gas globally and the application of more sophisticated production technologies in particular, the creation of multiple hydraulic fractures from horizontal wells (Britt and Smith 2009; Cramer 2008; King 2010) have motivated energy companies to increasingly develop harder-to-access natural gas resources such as tight sands, shale gas and coal bed methane. These unconventional reservoirs with ultra-low permeabilities are known to be more abundant throughout the world and are likely to be the dominant suppliers of future natural gas production (Holditch 2006).

                    "abstract": "Both small- (micron) to large- (centimeter) scale heterogeneities in carbonates cause the injected acids to propagate very differently than that predicted by a homogeneous model. Very few studies, either theoretical or experimental, address the effect of large scale heterogeneities (vugs) on matrix acidizing. This study explores the effects of heterogeneity on vuggy carbonate acidizing with high resolution computerized tomography imaging, image processing, geostatistical characterization, acid core-flood experiments (with 4-inch by 20-inch vuggy cores), and numerical simulations. We observed that acid propagates wormholes through vuggy carbonates much more rapidly than those in homogeneous rocks. In fact, an order of magnitude early acid breakthrough observed in the experiments highlighted the necessity of understanding the flow and transport in vuggy carbonates. The fact that acid channeled through the vugular cores and following the path of the vug system, is underlined with computerized tomography scans of the cores before- and after acid injection and with the connected component labeling (CCL) algorithm. This observation suggests that the local pressure drops created by vugs are more dominant in establishing the wormhole flow path than the chemical reactions occurring at the pore level. Following this idea, we present a modeling study to understand the flow in porous media in the presence of vugs. Use of coupled Darcy and Stokes flow principles, known as Darcy–Brinkman formulation (DBF), underpin the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the total injection volume to breakthrough is affected by spatial distribution, and the amount and connectivity of vuggy pore space. Much deeper penetration of wormholes is predicted for the vugular rocks with low pore volumes to breakthrough or PVbt ranging from 0.04 to 0.15, compared to the homogeneous cases with PVbt close to one.

                    "abstract": "Pickling well tubulars to prevent pumping unwanted materials into the formation is an issue that should be decided on an individual-job basis. Acid pickling of tubing is a process of flow in a tube or an annulus with heterogeneous reactions occurring at the wall of the tube. The reacting solid species at the wall are primarily mill scale and other types of inorganic scale. The fluids injected for pickling are usually strong acid solutions [hydrochloric acid (HCl)] but also may include surfactants, organic solvents, and gelled solutions to aid in lifting solids from the wellbore. Thus, the process is a complex one involving several reactions and perhaps multiple stages of fluids. Tubing pickling is an essential part of well-stimulation treatments if the main acid is to be bullheaded. Standard design parameters for a pickle treatment depend on experience and personal judgment. It appears that the standard pickle-treatment design is overestimating the required volume of pickling acid. Field data indicated that excessive acid volumes were used for tubing pickling because large returns of unreacted (live) acid were recovered at the surface. Careful analysis of flowback samples obtained from several deep gas wells showed that only a fraction of the acid was consumed by mill scale and other tubing contaminants. In this paper, proposed mechanisms are presented to explain the behavior of acid contact with the tubing and a mathematical model is developed to predict acid consumption and dissolution of tubular contaminants. The model applies to the bullheading case where the acid is pumped down the tubing and then flowed back to the surface. The model considers the reaction of acid with mill scale (Fe3O4). The equations formulated are solved numerically to predict the concentrations of major chemical species in the well flowback samples. Such a model is extremely valuable in optimizing future pickling treatments. The acid volume needed for pickling operations can be reduced significantly, and other improvements can be made without extensive and costly field testing. Finally, recommendations are given to design acid-pickling treatments better. "

These micro-models serve as both a research and pedagogical tool, facilitating the direct visualization of drainage and imbibition within quasi-2D porous media, generated from a range of image modalities (e.g. thin section micrographs, μCT orthoslices, and conventional digital photography). Written in the MATLAB™ language and readily extendible, this open source toolkit is intended to act as enabler for community research for the study of transport in a porous media. In this work, we demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities using X-ray micro-tomographic image data. Orthoslices of scanned rocks (Berea sandstone) are cropped and segmented (binarized), then used to generate watertight 3D meshes of micro-models, which are exported as stereolithography (.stl) files: a native format to most commercially available 3D printers. The generated models are self-contained, with the inlet-outlet ports, synthetic rock matrix and transparent viewing panels printed as a single integrated unit. The open source toolkit presented here offers a more accessible and adaptive approach to micromodel fabrication, when compared to conventional etched/molded equivalents, which require highly specialized manufacturing facilities. We suggest that the availability of such a toolset will act as a major enabler for community research in porous media transport phenomena, allowing experimental quasi-2D pore networks to be generated rapidly and cost effectively using readily available additive manufacturing technologies.

We measure the mass of water imbibed in air saturated cores as a function of time under strongly water-wet conditions. Specifically, we perform co-current spontaneous experiments using a highly sensitive balance to measure the mass imbibed as a function of time for the three rocks. We use cores measuring 37 mm in diameter and three lengths of approximately 76 mm, 204 mm, and 290 mm. We show that the amount imbibed scales as the square root of time and find the parameter C, where the volume imbibed per unit cross-sectional area at time t is Ct1/2. We find higher C values for higher permeability rocks. Employing semi-analytical solutions for one-dimensional flow and using reasonable estimates of relative permeability and capillary pressure, we can match the experimental data. We finally discuss how, in combination with conventional measurements, we can use theoretical solutions and imbibition measurements to find or constrain relative permeability and capillary pressure.

A newly derived solution for capillary dominated flow is investigated by comparing it to experimental and numerical simulation data of spontaneous imbibition in water-wet rocks. The analytical solution allows for the estimation of relative permeability and capillary pressure data for rocks. To validate the analytical solution, it is evaluated for published data for co-current and counter-current spontaneous imbibition on four water wet rock samples. The published experimental saturation data for these rocks is scaled by the square root of time, and the result is compared with the corresponding analytical solution. To further investigate the validity of the analytical solution, a 1-D numerical simulation model is created for the spontaneous imbibition experimental setup and run with identical conditions. Experimental data for spontaneous imbibition, when scaled by the square root of time, converges approximately to a single curve. It is therefore evident that the analytical solution is valid for water-wet rocks. Saturation function curves that are obtained from the analytical solution are then used as inputs to 1-D numerical models of cores with properties and dimensions that are identical to the experiments. The saturation profiles obtained from numerical modelling results, when scaled by the square root of time, display good quantitative agreement with the analytical solution, with deviations between the two sets of results varying in the range of 1 – 6% for the four data sets. The analytical solution is very promising in that it can be used as a basis to extract otherwise time consuming Special Core Analysis (SCAL) properties by carrying out relatively fast and simple spontaneous imbibition experiments. The procedure introduced can also be adopted as a complement to the existing SCAL experiments to verify results. "

They can be used to study the influence of wettability, predicting saturation profiles and production rates characteristic for water-wet and mixed-wet conditions. We compare our results with in-situ measurements of saturation profiles for SI in a water-wet medium. We show that the characteristic shape of the saturation profile is consistent with the expected form of the relative permeabilities. We discuss how measurements of imbibition profiles, in combination with other measurements, could be used to determine relative permeability and capillary pressure. "

It is now possible to fully resolve simpler pore systems and thus perform static modelling of flow properties. A substantial amount of research has been performed to fully develop workflows relating to the analysis of a number of sandstone and carbonate core samples from benchmark outcrop rocks. In this study the focus is on Bentheimer, Clashach and Doddington sandstone rocks and on Estaillades, Ketton and Portland limestone samples. These benchmarks have been imaged using a micro-CT at a resolution of about 3 µm. The image-based modelling and analysis of the absolute permeabilities gave values within a similar range of the experimental results for all three of the sandstone samples. Results deviated greatly for the limestone due to the presence of unresolvable pore space, reflecting the need to acquire higher resolution data to obtain a full digital description of the samples at hand. The variation in the petrophysical parameters with the size of the selected subvolume (either 512 or 1024 voxels) is the focus in the present study. With the notable exception of Clashach, the homogeneous sandstones do give the same results for the two subset sizes. The limestone data varies by more than a factor of four for the permeabilities whereas the porosity varies by less than a factor of two. The extracted pore size distributions vary quite significantly from the experimental ones regardless of the subset size and the bimodal nature of the limestone pore space is not captured at all. This is reflected in the capillary pressure curves, the image-based ones are significantly different from the experimental ones. The reconstructed 3D acquisitions and 2D slices will be posted online to form a database that allows for download of the tomographic images and extracted pore spaces to serve as a resource for future comparative modelling studies.

We take cores containing oil and a specified initial water saturation and waterflood until 10 pore volumes have been injected. We record the remaining oil saturation as a function of the amount of water injected. In the water-wet case, with no wettability alteration, we observe, as expected, a monotonic increase in the remaining oil saturation with initial saturation. However, when the wettability is altered, we observe an increase, then a decrease, and finally an increase in the trapping curve for Estaillades limestone with a small, but continued, decrease in the remaining saturation as more water is injected. This behavior is indicative of mixed-wet or intermediate-wet conditions, as there is no spontaneous imbibition of oil and water. In contrast, Ketton did not show indications of a significant wettability alteration with a similar observed trapping profile to that observed in the water-wet case. Portland limestone also showed a monotonic increasing trend in remaining saturation with initial saturation but with a higher recovery, and less trapping, than the water-wet case. Again, this is intermediate-wet behavior with no spontaneous imbibition of either oil or water, and slow production of oil after water breakthrough. Finally, we repeat the same experiments but instead we age the three carbonates with a high asphaltenic content and high viscosity crude oil at 70 °C mimicking reservoir conditions. The results show a monotonic increase in residual saturation as a function of initial saturation but with higher recovery than the water-wet cases for Estaillades and Portland, with again no indication of wettability alteration for Ketton. We discuss the results in terms of pore-scale recovery process and contact angle hysteresis. In these experiments, water-saturated micro-porosity appears to protect the solid surfaces from a strong wettability alteration, particularly in Ketton. "

However, these greyscale images cannot be directly input into simulators to predict flow properties; they require image processing to segment the solid and void space in the rock. Dynamic and static single phase properties can then be computed using the images directly or on extracted equivalent network models. In this paper, we study the effect of imaging resolution (five different voxel sizes ranging from 6-20 μm) of Clashach and Doddington sandstone on predicted single phase properties (porosity and absolute permeability) and network properties. Experimental data is used to validate the predictions. The results suggest that the computed porosity was largely independent of resolution and in good agreement with the measured value, while image resolutions of a few microns are sufficient to determine the permeability of a high-permeability rock such as Doddington but may not be sufficient for lower permeability samples. The topologically representative networks are sensitive to resolution, adding additional smaller pores and throats as the resolution is increased. This latter reason was confirmed by a network extraction analysis that indicated the average throat radius was 6 µm, similar to the highest resolution used and insufficient to image all important features of the pore space properly.

This study investigates some of the idiosyncrasies that have been reported in a large number of FCTs, which make after-closure (AC) analysis ambiguous or inconsistent. We recently introduced a novel comprehensive model for FCT analysis, combining before-closure (BC) and AC behavior in a fully consistent way, facilitating the detection of abnormal BC events (i.e. multiple closure and non-linear leakoff) and improving the intrinsic weakness of standalone AC analysis methods. Extensive use of this model on a vast number of shale gas FCTs has revealed the existence of apparent AC anomalies. This paper provides a novel approach to identify and diagnose these apparent anomalies and reconcile them with unique aspects of the tested unconventional shale formations. In the AC anomaly that we firstly addressed in SPE-144028-MS, the logarithmic derivative shows only a minimal indication of formation linear flow, showing instead an abrupt transition to pseudo-radial flow. This unresolved anomaly inspired the work presented in this paper, where twenty FCT published case histories were used to study and reveal four distinct anomalies:  – AC logarithmic derivative exhibits unit slope, a symptom of horizontal fracture; Multiple closures followed by AC logarithmic derivative that exhibits a late-time \"hook\"; AC logarithmic derivative exhibits abrupt transition to pseudo-radial flow with limited or no linear flow; AC logarithmic derivative exhibits an apparent dual porosity \"dip\".  These AC idiosyncrasies have been rationalized and integrated into our established comprehensive model for FCT analysis, allowing a realistic characterization of the geological, tectonic, and wellbore -related geometric signatures that very commonly manifest themselves in all shale formations.

                    "abstract": "Well testing is an integral element in reservoir and fluid characterization. It is a continuously developing discipline and has seen steady progress over the years. Interpretation techniques have evolved significantly over time, starting with straight-line analysis, then onto log-log analysis, followed by log-log derivative analysis and finally onto the newest standing technique today, deconvolution. Shutting in wells in producing fields to carry out pressure transient analysis can prove to be difficult and often expensive. Frequent short shut-ins are normally dictated by operational well requirements, however, these shut-ins are normally not long enough for the classical pressure transient analysis to be conducted. In this paper, we show how this issue can be resolved by applying deconvolution methods to aid us with pressure transient analysis for these short build up durations Deconvolution is fundamentally a mathematical algorithm used to convert variable rate data to constant rate data. In other words, it can be used to convert data into a single drawdown with a constant rate. This conversion yields to simplified analysis by allowing more of the same data to be analyzed. As a result of this approach, attaining definite conclusions about reservoir properties becomes possible. Prior to this, unclear and uncertain conclusions were often made. The data presented below was first analyzed using standard transient analysis techniques. This resulted in non-unique solutions. The data was later analyzed using the deconvolution algorithm (von Schroeter 2001). It was found that this analysis, using deconvolution, along with an understanding of the geological setting, managed to produce clear and conclusive results about the reservoir. In this paper, we demonstrate that for a given production scenario, a dedicated well test may not necessarily be required. Instead, deconvolution can be utilized on short build ups, which are often already conducted for well maintenance, leading to both clearer results and significant cost savings. "

Thus, it restricts the flow of the fluids from the formation to the wellbore and to the surface and, hence, leads to production loss. The remedial measures for asphaltenes deposition, however, cost money and time. The aim of the study presented in this paper was to experimentally investigate the role of ultrasonic wave technology as an asphaltenes flocculation inhibitor and to quantify the actual reduction in asphaltenes content of the crude oil when ultrasonic waves were applied. For these purposes, sonication experiments, viscosity measurements, and asphaltenes extraction experiments were performed. Moreover, this study aimed to verify the results and the conclusions that were achieved in a previous similar work by repeating some of the methods they used with different crude oil sample. Conducting this experimental study led to the conclusions that ultrasonic waves have the ability to break down asphaltenes conglomerates and, hence, reduce asphaltenes content in crude oil samples and that there is an optimum time for sonication at which highest asphaltenes particles disintegration is achieved. Moreover, it was concluded that the crude oil viscosity is influenced by its asphaltenes content. "

                    "abstract": "After more than a decade of production years, the thick heterogeneous carbonate reservoir in the middle-east region would need to be rejuvenated to unlock more potential from the hidden layers that were not properly stimulated on the initial completion phase resulting deficient recovery distribution. The giant carbonate reservoir constitutes a tremendous thick pay zone with multiple heterogeneities that increase the uncertainty level. The reservoirs were completed using various completion and stimulation design initially. These various completion designs implement the effort to overcome the initial uncertainties due to formation thickness and complexity. As the reservoirs are being recovered, the degree of uncertainty is also increase by having production dynamics. Despite the well-known reservoir characteristics, the well production dynamic also affect the reservoir heterogeneity such as uneven pressure depletion due to wormholes from previous stimulation. On the mature carbonate formation that had stimulation treatment, existing wormholes from the previous stimulation may still exist and normally they are on the high conductivity layers due to improper diversion. As the degree of uncertainty is increased, restimulation treatment becomes more challenging as more uncertainties need to be taken into account on the design. Additional data to initial completion phase would have to be analyzed in order to minimize the uncertainties from the production dynamics. To overcome these uncertainties, proper stimulation treatment has to be designed and diverter utilization would take an important role of the treatment. Preliminary validation to the design is required in order to achieve optimum and efficient treatment. This paper will present the single-stage restimulation design methodology based on the field case history. It consists of an exceptional design, execution, and evaluation cycle for fine tuning the details covering the major uncertainties available on these mature wells. The cycle is started from collecting the additional information to the initial ones, analyzing the production dynamics, and eventually designing and fine tunes the diverter design to optimize the stimulation fluid placement. The restimulation treatment is proposed in such an efficient way to deal with the additional uncertainties from the production dynamic. The output from this is fluid selection, treatment schedule (sequence and pumping rate), diversion design, and treatment conveyance. The design will have more than one scenario as a result of potential uncertainties during the execution. The cycle was then completed with the evaluation of the treatment and the lesson learnt was applied. Production profile after restimulation treatment shows that the stimulation target has been achieved efficiently in order to drain unstimulated layers. A combination of bottomhole pressure data and production log results more accurate on fluid placement estimation and as basic for the future design. Optimizing treatment fluid through all layers can be achieved for maximizing the well potential. "

                    "abstract": "In mature carbonate reservoirs, the potential for bypassed or under-stimulated pays need to be addressed in order to enhance the productivity of the wells. Reservoir restimulation is one of the viable option to do this. However, due to issues with completion, perforation and other associated issues that given wells may have, restimulation should be designed and implemented such that well productivity is enhanced while simultaneously maintaining the requirements for well completion integrity. Proper design for restimulation in thick carbonate reservoirs could eliminate any negative issues that may occur during completion and prevent integrity failure during the process. In thick carbonate reservoirs, like those found in the Middle East, the aforementioned criteria contain both petrophysical properties and current production profile obtained by production logging, establishing good foundation for implementing restimulation. Petrophysical properties help define the stimulation strategy necessary based on log potential, while the current production profile identifies the best location to stimulate over the existing completed perforated interval. In thick carbonate stimulation, uneven reservoir recovery is often observed and considerable parameters must be set during the stimulation design. Major changes to consider during the candidate evaluation for the restimulation in thick carbonate reservoir are: non-uniform pressure depletion across the formation, various pressure drawdowns, and change in PVT properties. In addition, wormholes which formed during the initial reservoir stimulation are major factor for consideration. These wormholes may act as thief zones during restimulation work and could lead to improper zonal coverage. This paper describes restimulation design strategy which has been tailored for well preparation based on mature well conditions while also considering factors of completion and well-integrity issues. The well preparation includes focus on the reperforation selection, post-reperforation production log evaluation and production profile matching. Within the stimulation strategy, fluid selection and placement strategy will be discussed, taking into considering all aspects of a mature well. "

                    "abstract": "The formation permeability is an essential input for modern hydraulic fracture design. In tight formations estimation of formation permeability and pressure can be impractical or even impossible to determine by conventional pressure buildup transient tests because the formation virtually cannot flow without the fracture stimulation. Traditional fracture calibration tests including minifrac and data-frac provided estimates for the fracture minimum closure stress and the leakoff coefficient. More recently, the continued acquisition of the injection falloff transient pressures after the fracture closure as in the Diagnostic Fracture Injection Test (DFIT) has provided estimates for formation permeability and pressure that could not have been determined from a conventional transient test. After-closure analysis can also yield permeability and pressure in conventional reservoirs and thereby eliminate the need for a pressure buildup test. This paper provides a model for simulating the fracture calibration test to be used for test design and interpretation. The challenge for tight formations is to find an injection volume sufficient to create a suitable fracture while minimizing the closure time in the subsequent pressure falloff. This, in turn, reduces the time required to see after-closure transient features that are used for estimation of formation pressure and permeability. For higher permeability formations, the model enables estimation of the total test time including after-closure radial flow from which estimates of formation pressure and permeability are straightforwardly determined. The design examples included in this paper are based on actual field data and demonstrate that fracture calibration tests provide an efficient and reliable means for determination of not only closure stress and the leakoff coefficient, but also the formation pressure and permeability, in the course of a realistic and viable amount of time.

                    "abstract": "Carbonate stimulation design constitutes many uncertainties and challenges. Reservoir heterogeneity, in addition to the formation damage, complicates the attempt to understand matrix acidizing stimulation design. Without proper reservoir characterization and modeling, stimulation treatment uncertainty cannot be predicted nor evaluated, which poses difficulties for treatment evaluation and improvement processes. In practice, complete and representative data necessary for treatment design may not available. In a mature carbonate reservoir, the degree of uncertainties is increasing significantly. The additional uncertainties come from the different hydrocarbon recovery methods across the formation which leads to different resistance to flow for the stimulation fluid that sometimes is not taken into account in the stimulation design. The increasing number of mature carbonates reservoirs in the world calls for a methodology to evaluate the uncertainties in mature carbonate formations that consider recovery uncertainties, pressure uncertainties, and formation damage uncertainties.  As operators are developing hydrocarbon potential in more complex carbonate formations, conventional matrix acidizing may not be the best treatment to achieve good production results. This paper will present the workflow that could optimize carbonate stimulation design, taking into account the uncertainties in mature fields. Stimulation strategy should not only be based on the knowledge of petrophysical data, but also on other key parameters that influence design. Several scenarios for those uncertainties will be simulated. The outcomes of this simulation scenario will be proposed for stimulation fluid selection and optimization. Introduction As the oil and gas industries become more advance, the reservoirs are getting mature and some of them are getting less efficient in term of recovery. Producing the hydrocarbon from the mature reservoir becomes more challenging and requires more technology. The maturity of the reservoir does not impact on the remaining recoverable reserve only but also the strategy to maximize the recovery. In carbonate reservoir, that covers more than 70% of the hydrocarbon reservoir in the world; mature reservoir would be related to the previous stimulation, uneven recovery, pressure depletion, and near wellbore saturation change. In some specific cases, subsidence and reservoir compaction would have a significant effect of hydrocarbon production (Susilo et al. 2003). The majority of the hydrocarbon reserves are being produced from carbonates reservoir. Besides their massive reserves, these carbonate formations share the characteristics of being carbonates, very heterogeneous, complex and difficult to be characterized. This heterogeneity and complexity poses a great challenge in achieving effective and consistent stimulation results. The main purpose of stimulation in carbonate reservoirs is to increase the connectivity between the formation and the wellbore in the entire zone of interest. Carbonate reservoirs are routinely stimulated with acid to improve production. Matrix acidizing in carbonates provides an opportunity not only to bypass damage around the wellbore, but to also improve the near-wellbore permeability by creating large flow channels (wormholes) with acid dissolution. Acid stimulation of carbonate formations using hydrochloric (HCl) acid-based systems to improve hydrocarbon production has been a common practice since the early days of the oil and gas industry. "

The long interval presents uncertainty on the key formation parameters considered in acid stimulation even with the best petrophysical measurement and interpretation available in the industry. Stimulation of such intervals can be further complicated by differential depletion between the zones and large differences in hydrostatic pressure during stimulation treatment. This paper strives to outline some of the key pitfalls that can occur due to the uncertainty in this data. Using reservoir simulations, the long term adverse impact of these pitfalls on both production and overall recovery can be shown.  Based on degradable fiber and visco-elastic surfactant technologies, a new acid diverter, has been applied, along with a placement model, to optimize treatment design and to maximize diversion in heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs. The system is robust, diverting from high permeability streaks, fissures and natural fractures with very little diverting effect from the low permeability zones, and therefore generates a more uniform stimulation than conventional fluid systems. This approach has been used to optimize various stimulation campaigns on carbonate fields throughout the Middle East.  The diversion technique does not overly rely on the accuracy of petrophysical data, such as permeability and porosity, or reservoir pressure and can be successful in a variety of potential scenarios.

                    "abstract": "Performance predictions of the In-Situ Combustion (ISC) process is a challenge as it involves complicated chemical reactions, fluids movement, phase changes, and heat and mass transfer. This study investigates how oil type and water presence can affect the ISC performance, based on using a combination of combustion tube and Thermogravimetric Analysis and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA/DSC) experiments. Combustion tube experiments were conducted with two different crude oil without water (Swi = 0%) and with the presence of water (Swi = 34%). Experimental conditions were kept constant (3 L/min air injection rate and 100 psig pack pressure) for all four experiments conducted with two different oil samples. To determine the chemical reactions that occurred during combustion tube experiments, the initial crude oil samples and their Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractions were subjected to TGA/DSC experiments under air injection at two constant heating rates with and without water addition. Because two heating rates were observed during combustion tube experiments, 5 °C/min was used to represent the slow heating region (Steam Plateau, Evaporation and Visbreaking) and 20 °C/min was used to mimic the rapid heating region (Cracking Region and Combustion Zone). To better understand the complicated mutual interactions of functional groups in crude oil, TGA/DSC experiments were repeated on normal-decane (an alkane), decanal (an aldehyde), decanone (a ketone), and decanol (an alcohol) which represent the low temperature oxidation (LTO) products. Note that these chemicals have a constant carbon number (C10). The combustion tube experiments showed that Oil 1 was able to burn for both conditions (with and without water), while Oil 2 could only sustain combustion with water. To determine the reason for this difference, the burning behavior of the crude oils and their individual SARA fractions with and without water additions was studied through TGA/DSC experiments. At the high heating rate (20 °C/min), heat generation does not vary for both crude oil samples. However, at the low heating rate (5 °C/min), Oil 1 generates a higher amount of energy at high temperature oxidation (HTO) zone. We observed similarities between the decanone (a ketone) burning behaviors with aromatics fractions for Oil 1 which indicates that the aromatics fraction may contain ketone functional groups as LTO products. Upon burning, ketones generate higher energy than any LTO products. Therefore, Oil 1 may have functional groups in its structure more like ketones which promotes its combustion more than Oil 2. While presence of water does not change the burning behavior of Oil 1, we observed that the aromatics fraction of Oil 2 in the presence of water generates components similar to decanol (an alcohol) burning behavior. Note that alcohols generate more heat than aldehydes upon burning which explains the enhancement of Oil 2 burning behavior in the presence of water. However, aldehydes produced less energy than ketones. As a result, the combustion performance of Oil 2 was poorer than Oil 1. These results suggest that the chemical structure of the aromatics fraction is critical for the success of ISC. Water and aromatics fraction interaction at elevated temperature favors ISC reactions.

                    "abstract": "Microwave heating has great potential to recover heavy oil reservoirs, because it significantly reduces the heating time and consequently the cost of heavy oil extraction. Moreover, heavy crude oils contain high amounts of polar molecules (asphaltenes) and polar functional groups, making them great microwaving candidates. This study investigates the microwave effectiveness for a specific heavy oil reservoir focused on its polar components. Furthermore, the impact of asphaltene precipitants and dispersants on microwave efficiency was investigated. A crude oil sample from Canada was subjected to microwave experiments for 30 seconds. Dielectric properties of the crude oil before and after exposure to microwave were mostly measured by using a vector network analyzer to quantify the overall polarity changes in the bulk crude. The impact of asphaltene precipitants (nC5 and nC7) and a dispersant (toluene) on microwave efficiency was also investigated. The crude oil sample was blended with nC5, nC7, or toluene at three varying doses (10%, 20%, or 50%) to investigate the impact of solvent dose on microwave efficiency. Microwave absorption and penetration depth were calculated to quantify the effectiveness of microwave heating. It has been observed through dielectric property measurements that microwave energy was absorbed by mainly the asphaltenes. Dielectric constant and loss tangent values of the blends prepared with asphaltene precipitants (nC5 and nC7) and toluene were measured before and after exposure to microwave to quantify the microwave absorption in different blends. Although precipitant mixtures had higher dielectric constants, the dispersant mixtures had much higher microwave absorption due to higher loss tangents. This finding was further supported by penetration depth measurements, in which dispersant mixtures had lower values, which led to higher microwave absorption of the crude oil mixtures. Microwave heating as a thermal enhanced oil recovery method is promising, however, complicated due to the uncontrollable nature of microwave penetration and absorption. This study reveals that while injection of an asphaltene precipitant to the desired reservoir locations can enhance the microwave penetration, injection of asphaltene dispersants will increase the microwave absorption. Cyclic injection of asphaltenes dispersants and precipitants may achieve the creation of effective heating spots within the reservoir by using only one microwave source. "

                    "abstract": "Heavy oil extraction via thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods is a challenging task due to low mobility of oil at reservoir conditions and high petroleum processing cost due to high impurity content of heavy oils. This task becomes more difficult with the decrease in oil prices. Hence, any effort to decrease the recovery or refinery cost of heavy oil production can make the extraction of these unconventional resources more feasible. Existing screening criteria tables are still in use to find the optimum thermal EOR methods to recover heavy oil reservoirs. However, since those tables ignore the role of oil and rock compositions in the success and failure of oil recovery through thermal methods, generally the thermal EOR response is different than expected. This study aims to extend existing screening criteria tables for thermal EOR methods by including the impact of oil and rock composition and investigates the produced oil quality originated from different EOR techniques. First, lab-scale steam assisted gravity drainage, in-situ combustion (ISC), steam injection, hot-water injection, and steam/solvent injection experiments were conducted on two different heavy oil samples. The success of each EOR process, the impact of oil type and reservoir rock were interpreted based on the variations between initial and the produced oil viscosity, density, and SARA (Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes) fraction content. Hydrocarbon composition of initial and produced oil samples was compared using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The differences in the molecular signatures were analyzed by a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy on initial and produced oil samples. GCMS analyses of initial oil samples indicated the biodegradation of the two crude oils were different and they showed high (low lighter component content) and slight (high lighter component content) biodegradation. In terms of produced oil quality, highly biodegraded oil sample responded to ISC better than the slightly biodegraded oil sample. Steam processes upgraded the highly biodegraded oil for the reservoir without clay. Thermal EOR methods are costly especially at the current price environment. Furthermore, because of the differences in the response of different thermal EOR methods to different reservoirs due to compositional variations in reservoir oil and rock, the thermal EOR methods are not widely applied. Our study is a step taken to improve the existing screening criteria tables to determine the successful thermal EOR candidates through inclusion of oil and rock compositions. "

The crude samples and their SARA (Saturate, Aromatic, Resins, and Asphaltenes) fractions were blended with surfactant solutions at their critical micelle concentration (CMC). Interaction of crude oils, crude oils' non-polar fractions (Saturates and Aromatics) and crude oils' polar fractions (Resins and Asphaltenes) with surfactant solutions were visualized under optical microscope. An innovative and quick method, dielectric constant measurements were used to quantify indirectly the polarity of the blends. These measurements were used to determine the best surfactant candidates to recover each oil samples and accuracy of this new method was validated through optical microscopy images. Microscopic images revealed asphaltenes have the higher contribution in the formation of micro-emulsions. It is observed that the polar-polar interaction of asphaltenes with resins adversely affected the surfactant performance due to reduction in overall polarity. We found that as the dielectric constant increases, the polarity of the oil/surfactant blends (microemulsions) increases which indicates that polar-polar interaction between oil/surfactant is minimized and the effectiveness of surfactants is maximized. Microscopic images were used to confirm this finding and for the blends having higher dielectric constants, minimum interaction of resins with surfactants and lower asphaltene aggregation for the same crude oil-surfactant blends were observed. Our results offer that dielectric constant measurements can be used as an innovative and easy surfactant screening method. "

                    "abstract": "Over the past year and a half, the price of oil has plummeted from over $100 US per bbl in early 2014 to less than $47 US per bbl in the mid of 2017. In an attempt to sustain production without incurring significant additional expenditures, some operators may choose to implement enhanced oil recovery projects (such as waterflooding) while also utilizing existing infrastructure in the field. This paper focuses on one method of doing this by converting watered out or poor-performing horizontal production wells into horizontal water injection wells. The goal of this study was to create a screening criteria list which will enable assessment of a field to see if it could benefit from horizontal injection by way of converted horizontal production wells. The study began with a literature search to determine if a similar study had been conducted previously. When the study was found to be unique, the literature search then focused on understanding the background of horizontal water injection, along with case studies to see which conditions led to success or poor performance of horizontal water injection schemes. The applications, optimization techniques, evaluation methods and challenges involved in conversion of horizontal production wells to injectors and the horizontal injection process itself have been summarized and compiled into a screening criteria chart which can be broadly applied to any field to see if it is suitable for the proposed application. The screening process works by assigning zero, one, or two points to the response to a number of criteria regarding the reservoir, fluids, wells, and other information. A higher point value indicates a higher likelihood of a positive outcome if a horizontal production well is converted to a water injector. "

Viscosities of these polymer solutions were measured before and after exposure to the rock samples to establish a correlation between polymer adsorption and rock mineralogy and/or organic content. Results indicate a direct correlation between polymer adsorption and both rock mineralogy. Cationic polymers are shown to be more prone to adsorption onto the surface of the rock than non-ionic polymers. The results from this work establish that fluid-rock interactions are significant and that further research regarding shale polymer interactions and its effects on hydrocarbon production is needed with representative downhole shale samples given the trends now shown with outcrop samples.

In the present study, we investigated the impact of fracture orientation on ISC performance through one dimensional combustion tube experiments on a Canadian bitumen, which possesses good burning characteristics. Two ISC experiments with fractures oriented perpendicular and parallel to the air injection direction were conducted at identical initial and experimental conditions. Fracture formation was visualized with X-ray computed tomography. Temperature profiles, gas compositions, and oil and water production data were recorded continuously during the experiments. Oil upgrading was quantified through viscosity measurements and weight percent of Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractions. SARA fractions were further characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Metal content of produced water samples was determined with Inductive Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Our results show that both fracture types interrupted stable propagation of the combustion front; while the oxygen utilization rate was detected to be lower in the presence of parallel fractures. Thus, parallel fractures led to poorer ISC performance, resulting in lower combustion front velocity and oil production rate compared to perpendicular fractures. Furthermore, the lower oxygen utilization rate increased the interaction between displaced oil and oxygen at lower temperature regions, resulting in Low Temperature Oxidation (LTO) reactions. The produced oil density for parallel fractures was found to be higher than for perpendicular fractures. This difference was attributed to the structural differences in aromatics fraction, mainly determined through FTIR analysis. On the other hand, for both fracture orientations it was observed that the oil-water interaction in terms of metal content of produced water was insignificant due to high temperature oxidation (HTO) reactions.

Thermogravimetric Analyzer/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA/DSC) was used to simulate combustion via air injection and pyrolysis via nitrogen injection. These experiments were carried out with and without addition of water and a catalyst (iron oxide), at three different heating rates. The organic and inorganic composition of the oil shale samples before and after the experiments were determined via FTIR. The effectiveness of the processes was examined by the thermal decomposition temperature of kerogen and activation energy requirement. It has been observed that the combustion process is a more efficient method for the extraction of kerogen from oil shale than the conventional pyrolysis. The addition of water and catalyst to combustion has been found to lower the required temperature for kerogen decomposition for lower heating rate. Combustion and pyrolysis at higher heating rates are found to generate higher amount of heat from the process.

                    "abstract": "The goal of solvent-steam-flooding is enhancing bitumen displacement by the simultaneous development of solvent miscibility and reduction of oil viscosity. Though this strategy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, solvents are generally expensive. Additionally, bitumen recovery performance is affected by oil/solvent/clay/asphaltene interactions on the pore-scale level. Therefore, solvent dosage and type must be optimized to maximize recovery, while minimizing environmental impacts and operational costs. To investigate the performance of solvent-steam processes, six-core flooding experiments were conducted on a Canadian bitumen sample with 8.8°API and 54,000 cP at room temperature. Propane-steam flooding was tested and compared to steam-flooding. The effect of reservoir clays is studied by carrying out experiments in the presence and absent of clays. Three propane flow rates were tested to examine the impact of solvent dosages. After the experiments, asphaltene, clay, viscosity, and water contents in produced oil were measured. The results indicated that propane-steam flooding increased recovery factors, accelerated production, and had higher quality oil than steam-flooding. The lowest propane flow rate (1:9 v/v) improved oil recovery by 23%, indicating that higher solvent concentration may not be needed. This work reveals that bitumen microscopic displacement efficiency is enhanced by the addition of solvent to steam flooding. It is proposed that pore-scale interactions, solvent flow rate, and clays also highly influence produced oil quality and oil recovery rates. "

                    "abstract": "Knowledge of water/rock interactions on the surface of fractures is important to develop an understanding of the geological structures and changes within the formation, and to determine hydraulic-fracturing (HF) performance. To obtain this knowledge, this study investigates water/shale interactions in carbonate-rich (Eagle Ford), organic-rich (Green River), clay-rich (Barnett), and other-minerals-rich (Marcellus) shale samples. Crushed shale samples were exposed to water for 3 weeks at reservoir conditions. The water and rock samples before and after each static experiment were subjected to several analyses. The change in the rock mineralogy was defined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the elemental composition of rock was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and the organic content of rock samples was estimated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The water was analyzed for its anions and cations, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and average particle sizes of colloids. The stability of the colloids was characterized by zeta-potential. We show that Barnett rock is high in illite content, and the greatest calcite concentration is determined for Eagle Ford. The sulfate content of water correlates with the atomic percent of the sulfur and oxygen elements determined through XPS analyses. The magnesium content of water correlates mainly with the illite amount in the rock, and calcium concentration associates with the calcite and gypsum content of the rock samples. The greatest dissolution rate belongs to the minerals that yield sulfate in the water; then, gypsum and calcite that yield calcium cation in the water come second; and the lowest dissolution rates are obtained from the magnesium-containing minerals (mainly, dolomite). TDS of the water samples shows that Green River has the least tendency to interact with water, and Barnett has the greatest tendency. Zeta-potential values indicate that particles in the water that interacted with Eagle Ford have the highest tendency for precipitation. The results of this study are used to make suggestions on the engineering of hydraulic-fracturing fluids (HFFs) in the context of water/rock interactions by considering the type and the concentration of ions along with colloidal stability determined through zeta-potential measurements.

                    "abstract": "Asphaltenes precipitation within reservoir pores or production flowlines can severely hamper the petroleum-extraction process. Although the effect of temperature and pressure on asphaltene deposition is well-known, the manner in which the variations in oil composition affect the asphaltenes-precipitation mechanism requires more clarity. This work investigates the effect of crude-oil compositional change on asphaltene stability. The impact of oil composition is analyzed by preparing pseudocomponents through blending the crude oil with their own saturates fractions. A systematic characterization of 11 different bitumen and crude-oil samples was carried out by density and viscosity measurements and the determination of the elemental composition and saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes (SARA) contents. Further analyses were conducted on the asphaltenes separated by use of n-pentane. The cluster size was determined by a particle-size analyzer, and the stability of asphaltenes was evaluated by zeta-potential. The molecular structure of SARA fractions and bulk crude-oil samples was analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Onset-of-asphaltenes-precipitation (OAP) tests on crude-oil samples were achieved by the addition of different solvents (n-pentane, n-heptane, and crude-oil saturates fraction). While the physical characterization studies could only provide weak relations between the density/viscosity and the asphaltene content of the bulk samples, it has been found that mainly the ratio of the heavy (resins+asphaltenes) to light (saturates+aromatics) fractions controls the viscosity and the °API value of the crude oils. As this ratio increases, the crude oil becomes more viscous and dense. Also, the asphaltene/resin ratio was found to be critical because of its impact on asphaltene stability, which was determined through zeta-potential measurements. The high asphaltene/resin ratios result in low asphaltene stability; however, this effect is surpassed by the higher aromatics fraction in the bulk oil. Asphaltene stability was further studied with OAP tests. The OAP-test results provide the behavior of asphaltenes after the interaction of bulk oil samples with normal saturated hydrocarbons; however, our study improves the OAP-test procedure by conducting OAP tests with crude oil’s own saturates fractions. The interaction of saturates fraction with crude oil resulted in more asphaltenes precipitation compared with interaction of n-pentane and n-heptane. The FTIR analyses indicate the presence of impurities in saturates fractions, and these impurities are believed to cause higher asphaltenes precipitation as a result of the polar nature of the impurities.

                    "abstract": "Fluid flow through the reservoir is defined on the basis of the relative permeability which essentially captures the preferential flow of any specific fluid. Utilization of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) presents challenges to the conventional understanding of relative permeability due to the introduction of heat to the reservoir. The presence of three distinct fluid phases (steam, water, and oil) in conjunction with a temperature dependency has many implications for the modelling of complex fluid dynamics. However, effective characterization of relative permeability curves is integral to successful simulation and so a model capable of representing three-phase flow is required. By implementing a simplified fractional flow analysis, this study is able to regress three-phase flow in the laboratory to a pseudo two-phase relative permeability. Modifications of conventional fractional flow theory allow for the extension of the analysis to the SAGD and solvent aided-SAGD (S-SAGD) process. Overall displacement is defined on the basis of both a microscopic component represented by modified capillary number and a macroscopic component represented by mobility ratio. Negation of the liquid-gas interaction through the assumption of waterflooding enables the generation of pseudo two-phase relative permeability curves that result in comparable performance to lab scale experiments. Because the experimentally obtained SAGD and S-SAGD results are used to construct the pseudo-relative permeability curves, our model includes the many complex fundamental changes occur in viscosity and relative permeability during SAGD and S-SAGD in the newly constructed relative permeability curves. Thus, our results offer a simplistic way to ease the compositional simulation of SAGD and S-SAGD through waterflooding approach. "

                    "abstract": "Solvent Assisted-Steam Flooding (SA-SF) was developed to address the environmental and economic challenges associated with steam generation. The solvent composition can greatly affect its interaction with both the asphaltenes present in the oil as well as the clays in the reservoir; therefore solvent selection plays a major role in the process. This study explores the wettability alteration mechanism of oil recovery, and how the solvent selection impacts its performance. Five experiments were conducted; two chemical flooding (E1 and E2), one steam flooding (E3) and two SA-SF (E4 and E5) experiments. The solvents tested were n-hexane (E1 and E4) and a commercial solvent (CS) (E2 and E5). The wettability alteration caused by the different enhanced oil recovery methods was established through contact angle measurements. The asphaltene and clay content of the produced oil was determined using standard methods. The residual oil content was measured by washing the postmortem samples with toluene, an asphaltene soluble solvent capable of removing all the oil present in the rock. The oil recovery rate was used to measure the performance of each experiment. Although all experiments had a final wettability that is considered oil-wet, they varied among each other. Experiment E4 showed the least oil-wet surface, while E5 showed the most. At the same time E4 yielded the highest oil recovery of the SA-SF experiments. Lowest clay content and highest asphaltene content was observed in the produced oil of E5, while the opposite was seen in E4. Asphaltene-clay-water interactions in the pores affect the wettability of the rock while the solvent used directly impacts the quantity of asphaltene and clay present. Asphaltenes as insoluble in n-hexane, therefore they precipitate out of the oil onto the rock, interacting with the clay and water to produce a less oil-wet surface, the CS however is composed of heavy dearomatized hydrocarbons which range from C11-C16 and enable more asphaltene production, as all produced oil samples showed. This study provides a data set for wettability alteration during steam-solvent processes. Our finding suggests that solvents control the wettability alteration due to their interaction with asphaltenes. Wettability varies according to the precipitated asphaltenes polarity and the distance from injection well. "

                    "abstract": "Solvent-steam processes gained popularity in recent years in the extraction of high-asphaltenes-content heavy hydrocarbons. However, while solvent selection is key for the success of these processes, the criteria for solvent selection are still not fully established. In this study, three asphaltenes insoluble (propane, n-hexane, carbon dioxide) and one asphaltenes soluble (toluene) solvents were tested on solvent-aided steam processes to extract a bitumen sample from Alberta, Canada. Both steam flooding and SAGD performances were analyzed. The impact of clay presence was investigated by conducting experiments with and without the addition of clays, consisting of an illite-kaolinite mixture. The results of this study suggest that the produced oil samples from steam injection processes are in the form of water-in-oil emulsions. It has been observed that the amount of asphaltenes in produced oil determines the amount of water trapped in the form of emulsions. Co-injection of solvent with steam decreases the interfacial film between water and asphaltenes. However, asphaltenes insoluble solvents were found to be more effective to eliminate the forces at the oil-water interface. Presence of clays also reduced the water content of emulsions. The results of this study suggest that carbon dioxide, which is a non-hydrocarbon asphaltenes-insoluble solvent, yields the greatest quality oil with the lowest amount of water and clay in produced oil and provides high oil recovery. Hence, it is recommended to use asphaltenes-insoluble, non-hydrocarbon solvents for the extraction of low API gravity, high viscosity, and high asphaltenes content reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "In-situ Combustion (ISC) has the potential to be the most effective enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method for heavy oil recovery. However, it is considered a high risk failure rate process since it is hard to predict the combustion reactions between complex crude oil and heterogeneous rock matrices. If the reservoir rock is reactive, like carbonates, the risk factor of ISC increases. This research studies the ISC performance for different rock matrices found in Alberta, Canada. The reaction kinetics analyses were carried out by Thermogravimetric Analysis/Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA/DSC) on bulk oil, and its Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractions at a constant heating rate (20°C/min). To better understand the combustion behavior of bulk oil, pseudo blends of SARA fractions were prepared and systematic TGA/DSC tests were run on these blends. Furthermore, the impact of reactive porous media on fuel formation mechanism was investigated by using clays and carbonates. The reaction kinetic analyses on bulk oil and SARA fractions suggest that asphaltenes, resins, and aromatics fractions go into endothermic reactions at elevated temperatures, still the asphaltenes fraction generates the greatest amount of heat. The two-component interaction of asphaltenes with other fractions produces less heat than the combustion of asphaltenes alone. The three- component pseudo blend prepared by mixing asphaltenes-resins-aromatics produced the highest amount of heat and we believe that in bulk oil combustion saturates by acting as an ignitor provides the necessary heat to initiate the reactions among aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes fractions. Moreover, the effect of reactive porous media on reaction kinetics of bulk oil were investigated at a constant heating rate (20°C/min). Carbonates and clays were used. Since the clays act like a catalyst, heat generation was observed lower with clays than carbonates and carbonates required more heat for successful combustion. While the heating rates during in-situ combustion are generated naturally, in TGA/DSC tests, a constant heating rate is applied. In this study, we used 20°C/min as the heating rate. If the same heating rate during ISC cannot be reached, then, the heat generation cannot be as high as reported in this manuscript. Thus, it is important to extend the systematic TGA/DSC analyses presented in this paper. Tests should be conducted at varying heating rates on different oil samples and on their SARA fractions. "

                    "abstract": "Destabilized asphaltenes cause serious problems by precipitating in the reservoir pores which reduces the oil flow by decreasing the reservoir porosity and permeability significantly. This study investigates the impact of clays and salinity on the stability of asphaltenes for five different crude oil samples. First, both n-pentane and n-heptane insoluble fractions of five crude oils were examined under microscope after the interaction with water, brine, and porous media. The porous media was prepared with clay only, sand only, or sand-clay mixture. A monovalent (NaCl) and a divalent (CaCl2) salts at 0.2% and 4% concentrations were used to prepare brine samples. The systematic microscopic imaging conducted on asphaltenes show that both n-pentane and n-heptane asphaltenes are getting dispersed in water phase. However, this dispersion is hampered with the existence of ions in water and this impact increases with the increase in brine concentration. Nevertheless, the destabilization of asphaltenes is more pronounced with the presence of clays. Because the destabilized asphaltenes are precipitated in porous media, asphaltenes precipitation impacts the wettability of porous media. Hence, the wettability of oil-water-rock and oil-brine-rock systems was determined through water-air contact angle measurements. The pseudo reservoir rock-oil-water/brine systems were prepared by keeping constant the weight of each component in the system for five crude oil samples. Reservoir rocks were prepared by mixing sand and clay. The brine was prepared either with NaCl or with CaCl2. The impact of salt concentration on wettability was tested for both 0.2% and 4% brine solutions. It has been observed that the asphaltenes fraction has an important role on wettability determination, however, the interaction of asphaltenes with deasphalted oil is the main contributor which defines the wettability of the system. Thus, our systematic analyses on asphaltenes should be extended and similar analyses should be conducted on the deasphalted oil fractions. "

                    "abstract": "Significant effort has been dedicated to understand the variables affecting asphaltene precipitation. Based on years of research, it is well known how variables such as temperature and pressure can affect the deposition of asphaltenes. However, much less is understood about the effect that asphaltene characteristics have on the tendency towards precipitation of different crude oils. We characterize extensively a series of n-pentane extracted asphaltenes and construct novel correlations with the stability of their corresponding crude oils. 11 different bitumen and crude oil samples are characterized first with API gravity and viscosity measurements, and thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses (TGA/DSC). The weight percentage of the asphaltenes in bulk samples are determined through n-pentane precipitation. The molecular structure of the asphaltenes is investigated with Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy. Asphaltene stability is measured by ?PS and by determining the Asphaltene Solubility Profile. The impact of hydrogen deficiency, heteroatom content and solubility distributions on other properties such as viscosity and aggregation behavior is also explored. It has been observed that there is weak relationship between the asphaltene content and API gravity or viscosity of the bulk samples. The weight percent of the light, intermediate, heavy, solid, and ash fractions of the asphaltenes, defined with TGA/DSC experiments, indicate that the carbon rich solid component of the bulk samples that can decompose over 550 °C, correlate with the weight percent of the asphaltenes in bulk oil. The ash content of the bulk oil, which is mainly composed of heavy metals like sulfur, nickel, and vanadium, is correlated to the amount of asphaltenes precipitated out of the oil. Moreover, FTIR and solubility profile analyses reveals that the polarity of the asphaltene molecules is affected not only by its molecular composition and structure but also by its interactions with other crude oil components. This study discusses the impact of the physical and chemical properties of crude oils and their asphaltenes on asphaltene precipitation. Several asphaltene deposition mechanisms are developed and validated for 11 different crude oil and bitumen samples with different asphaltene contents, thereby providing important and fundamental insight into asphaltene related problems.

However, the effective extraction of these unconventional resources cannot be accomplished by the application of conventional technologies. This study summarizes different combination of different Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods to recover effectively the low API gravity and high viscosity crudes to find the main factors affecting the EOR performances most. Several steam flooding, steam assisted gravity drainage, and solvent aided-steam processes (SA-SP) (both with asphaltene solvent and non-solvents) were tested on heavy, extra-heavy, and bitumen resources. Carbon dioxide, propane, n-hexane, and toluene were tested as solvents. While carbon dioxide, propane, and n-hexane are asphaltene non-solvents, toluene is asphaltene solvent. The process performances were discussed in terms of cumulative oil recovery and produced oil quality. Produced oil qualities were compared according to their asphaltene, clay, and water contents. Asphaltene content directly correlates to the water and clay contents of the produced oil samples. As the asphaltene content of produced oil increases while the water content increases, the clay content decreases. The worst produced oil quality was obtained by SAGD and toluene-SAGD. The experiments conducted with the asphaltenes insoluble solvents (carbon dioxide, propane, and n-hexane) produced the highest quality oil with low water content and high deasphalted oil content. "

                    "abstract": "Asphaltenes and resins are the polar and saturates and aromatics are the nonpolar fractions of the crude oil. The mutual interaction within crude oil fractions results in different overall polarity. With the onset asphaltene precipitation, the overall polarity starts to change drastically and this change affects the asphaltene stability more. This study investigates the crude oil fractions polarity and their individual impact on asphaltene precipitation. Two crude oil samples with different asphaltene content, API gravity, and viscosity were divided into their Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractions. The crude oils and their SARA fractions were characterized by Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy. The polarity of crude oils and their SARA fractions were determined through dielectric constant measurements by in-house-built capacitance. The polarity of the individual fractions and bulk crude oil samples were analyzed together to understand how the mutual interaction of crude oil fractions affects the asphaltene stability. The overall polarity of the crude oil is the key to asphaltene stability. Resins and asphaltenes are the polar components of crude oil, thus, resins to asphaltenes ratio affects the overall stability of the asphaltenes. Asphaltenes are soluble in aromatic solvents and insoluble in normal alkanes, thus, while the increase in the saturates fraction in crude oil decreases the asphaltene stability, the increase in the aromatics fraction in crude oil reestablishes the stabilization. The solvent power of saturates and aromatics fractions are controlled by the impurities in saturates and aromatics fractions. Because while saturates and aromatics are known as nonpolar fractions of crude oils, the impurity content of those fractions results in polar sides in both saturates and aromatics fractions. The polar side of those fractions makes the interaction with asphaltenes more pronounced and affect the stability of asphaltenes considerably. The holistic understanding of the asphaltene stability is achieved by analyzing the polarity of asphaltenes alone and within crude oil. These results are very useful in preventing the asphaltene precipitation and modelling its stability. "

The existing residual oil saturation determination methods are mainly based on solvent extraction. However, because the quality of the extracted residual oil and the remaining spent rock samples have not been examined before, this study investigates the accuracy of two commonly used solvent extraction methods for the residual oil saturation determination extracted from the spent rock samples of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Solvent-SAGD. The results of the commonly used solvent extraction methods were compared with a new thermal method. It has been found that the thermal method provides more accurate results than solvent extraction method because the reservoir clays interact with residual oil and solvent methods cannot successfully separate the residual oil from reservoir rock. Therefore, a significant amount of clay is detected in the extracted residual oil through solvent extraction. Moreover, this study reveals that among the saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes fractions of residual oil, the aromatics fraction is responsible for the clay–asphaltene interaction and the resins content reduces this interaction. Because the solvents used to separate residual oil from rock samples are in general strong aromatic solvents, the existing solvent extraction methods fail to determine the residual oil saturation amount accurately.

                    "abstract": "Enhanced oil displacement in a reservoir is highly affected by wettability alterations in conjunction with the lowering of viscosities during steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) for bitumen extraction. The impartation of energy in the form of heat to the fluid by injecting steam triggers an alteration to a more water-wet state during SAGD. However, the presence of three distinct phases in the reservoir has implications for the effective modeling of the complex fluid dynamics. Dependency of the relative permeability endpoints on the temperature realized as a function of the introduction of steam is difficult to model. Optimization of any steam process requires simulation in order to adequately characterize years of flow and so a model that is capable of representing three phase flow is necessary. To obtain this a pseudo-two phase relative permeability is proposed that assumes fractional flow theory is valid and treats the experiments as a waterflood. In this study, experimental recovery data for two SAGD experiments and one hot water flood are empirically matched by manipulating relative permeabilities. The analytical approach implemented allows for the representation of fluid flow in the reservoir by achieving a pseudo-two phase relative permeability that results in comparable performance to the experiments. Waterflooding techniques were utilized which allowed for the negation of the steam phase in the model and so two-phase flow was established. The sensitivity of the relative permeability curves to temperature change results in the inability to formulate a generic three-phase curve and so the pseudo-two phase curve is valuable for the purpose of simulation. The methodology presented enables the formulation of a simplified relative permeability that is unique to each process used and in that specific location. The model that was established was validated and proven credible by the good match with the experimentally obtained values. "

Then, series of dry combustion tests were conducted at different heating rates and wet combustion tests by water addition. The combustion efficiency was enhanced by mixing oil shale samples with an iron based catalyst. The effectiveness of dry, wet, and catalyst added combustion processes was examined by the thermal decomposition temperature of kerogen. Because the conventional oil shale extraction methods are pyrolysis (retorting) and steaming, the same experiments were conducted also under nitrogen injection to mimic retorting. It has been observed that the combustion process is a more efficient method for the extraction of kerogen from oil shale than the conventional techniques. The addition of water and catalyst to combustion has been found to lower the required temperature for kerogen decomposition for lower heating rate.

However, the solvent selection is vital due to the interaction of solvents with asphaltenes. Moreover, the polar nature of asphaltenes also enables asphaltene-steam interaction which may result in emulsion formation. This study investigates solvent-asphaltene-steam interaction during SA-SF with low and high molecular weight asphaltene insoluble solvents. Two different solvents were tested; n-hexane (E1 and E4) and a commercial solvent (CS) (E2 and E5) with four flooding experiments; two miscible flooding (E1 and E2) and two SA-SF (E4 and E5) experiments. Results were compared with steam flooding (E3) experiment. The performance evaluation of different enhanced oil recovery methods was accomplished by comparing the oil recovery rates. The asphaltene content of produced oil samples was determined by standard methods. The asphaltene-steam interaction was analyzed with microscopic images, and the water content of produced oil samples was measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Even though similar cumulative oil productions were obtained by the end of E1 (n-hexane-flooding) and E2 (CS-flooding), the produced oil quality varied due to asphaltene and clay contents. While higher clay content was measured for E1, E2 had a lower quality, due to higher asphaltene contents. This finding is due to the heavy dearomatized hydrocarbons composition of the CS which ranges from C11 up to C16 and enables more asphaltene production. Even though, E5 yielded the highest liquid production among all experiments; the produced liquid was composed of emulsified oil. The solvent aided-steam flooding (SA-SF) experimental results, which have been conducted with n-hexane/steam (E4) and CS/steam (E5) injections, suggest that as the asphaltene content increases in produced oil samples, more hard-to-break emulsions are formed. The unusual stability of these emulsions can be attributed to the nature of the asphaltene present in the produced oil. From the results presented, it is recommended the use of lower carbon number solvents to leave the larger amounts of asphaltenes in the reservoirs. The solvents differed in their interactions with the asphaltenes present in the oil and with the steam that has a direct impact not only on the quantity of oil produced but the quality as well. Hence, the wise selection of the appropriate solvent cannot be ignored during solvent aided-steam flooding processes. "

                    "abstract": "Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is a proved enhanced-oil-recovery technique for oil-sand extraction. However, the environmental and the economic challenges associated with steam generation limit the application of this technology. To address these issues, we have investigated the effectiveness of expanding-solvent-SAGD (ES-SAGD) over base SAGD on a bitumen sample (8.8 °API). Experimental studies are conducted with a 2D physical model. Different strategies for solvent injection are tested (coinjection and cyclic injection) to examine the impact of the deposition of the asphaltene fraction of the bitumen on porous media and the behavior of the asphaltene fraction in produced oil. Toluene is used as asphaltene-soluble solvent, and n-hexane is selected as asphaltene-insoluble. Steam-chamber development is monitored with temperature profiles from 47 separate positions. The oil rate, recovery factor, and the produced-oil quality are evaluated together. The effectiveness of SAGD and ES-SAGD is discussed by considering the role of asphaltenes and their interactions with clays in both produced- and residual-oil samples. This study reveals that coinjection of hydrocarbon solvents with steam enhances the steam-chamber development with higher oil-production rate. Moreover, ES-SAGD results in recovery of more-upgraded oil and has a lesser environmental impact. We observe that the selections of solvent type and injection strategy are the most crucial parameters for the design of a hybrid SAGD process, and solvent cost and toxicity can be minimized with the recycling of solvent for continuous injection of solvents. High-energy consumption for steam generation during the SAGD process can be reduced by coinjection of proper solvent type with steam at a proper injection strategy. Our study reveals that the ES-SAGD process has environmental and economic benefits that are preferable to those of the base SAGD. However, some solvents can cause undesirable effects because of asphaltene destabilization and precipitation in production or transportation lines. The results of this work show that not only asphaltenes but also the other fractions of oil, along with the reservoir-clay type and the clay amount, affect the ES-SAGD performance. "

Two SAGD experiments at identical experimental conditions were conducted. The reservoir rock for the first experiment (SAGD1) is prepared with a sand (85 wt%) and kaolinite (15 wt%) mixture, and the second experiment (SAGD2) is prepared with a sand (85 wt%), kaolinite (13.5 wt%), and illite (1.5 wt%) mixture. The effectiveness of the steam-chamber growth did not change with the clay type; however, 15-wt% reduction in oil recovery was observed for SAGD2. The possible reasons were investigated with the analyses on the produced-water, the produced-oil, and the spent-rock samples. Contact-angle, particle-size, zeta-potential, and interfacial-tension measurements were carried out on the samples. The mineralogical changes on spent-rock samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) analyses. The contact-angle measurements on the spent-rock samples displayed the higher oil-wetness for SAGD2 than SAGD1. However, the water-wetness of illite is known to be higher than that of kaolinite. This unexpected result is explained by the interaction of illite and the asphaltenes from SAGD2. The particle-size measurements, along with the SEM images, on post-mortem samples reveal that illite containing clay exhibits cementation behaviour and, hence, reduces the permeability of the rock. According to the experimental results, we developed hypotheses to understand the bitumen/illite and bitumen/kaolinite interactions for SAGD. Because of the high water-wetness of illite, illite particles first interact with water. This interaction results in cementation and forms illite lumps with sand. Then, illite lumps continue to interact more vigorously with the polar molecules (water, asphaltenes, and resins). Clay migration and production occur in both clay types; however, while kaolinite is produced in the water phase, illite-containing clay as a result of its interaction with asphaltenes is produced in the oil phase.

High rate steam production, or the adiabatic flashing of steam condensate to a vapor state, often creates an environment of \"flashing erosion\", erosive damage created by the water-cutting effect of high velocity wet steam or the corrosive elements (e.g., carbonic acid) that can be associated with low temperature condensate. Condensate flashing to steam also carries additional risk from \"cavitation erosion\", erosion of completion equipment that occurs from the sudden shock wave impacts caused by the implosion of small liquid-free zones with the condensate, similar to the well- understood water hammer effect. Conventionally, to prevent the production of live steam or the flashing of steam condensate, operators have relied upon choking production rates based upon monitored temperature differences between injected and produced fluids. However, this methodology based on subcool carries its own risks and undermines the economic viability of SAGD projects. Another approach is to improve conformance of steam injection and fluid production by installing inflow/injection control devices (ICDs) in either, or both, the SAGD injector and producer. If properly designed, these devices in the producer can equalize heel-to-toe influx of bitumen emulsion, provide greater control of the sub-cool, and behave as an autonomous (or self-regulating) valve. This presentation will focus upon this last design objective. By coupling published performance equations for various ICD designs with steam behavior equations, competing designs will be evaluated for their likelihood of steam flashing within a SAGD completion and their respective ability to control flashed steam prior to the steam creating damage in the completion. Further, the discussion will examine possible future avenues of research, such as ICD designs with a steam throttle effect driven through a velocity-sensitive choking of steam production. "

In the present study, we investigate the impact of perpendicular (E1) and lateral (E2) fractures to the air injection direction in ISC performance through one dimensional combustion tube experiments on a Canadian bitumen (8.6 °API, 53,000 cP), which possesses good burning characteristics. Two ISC experiments are conducted at identical initial (42% oil and 34% water saturations) and experimental (3.4L/min air rate, 100psig back pressure) conditions. The fracture formation is visualized with an X-ray computed tomography. During the experiments, temperature profiles, gas compositions, and oil and water production data are recorded continuously. The in-situ oil upgrading is investigated through viscosity measurements and weight percent of Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractions. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is used to characterize the SARA fractions. The metal content of produced water samples is determined with Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Both fracture types interrupt stable propagation of the combustion front; however, vertical fractures to air injection direction (E1) less likely affect the fate of ISC. The oxygen utilization rate is detected lower for the experiment with fractures parallel to the air injection direction (E2). Thus, E2 demonstrates poorer ISC performance by resulting in lower front velocity and oil production rate than E1. Moreover, the lower oxygen utilization rate increases the interaction between displaced oil and oxygen at lower temperature regions. This interaction results in Low Temperature Oxidation reactions (LTO) and increases the amount of aromatic fractions of the produced oil. This phenomena lowers the produced oil viscosity (83 cP) by increasing the solvent power of aromatic fractions. The produced oil density is found higher for E2 than E1. This difference is attributed to the structural differences in resins and asphaltenes molecules that are determined through FTIR analysis. Moreover, it has been observed that the oil-water interaction in terms of metal content of produced water is found insignificant in both experiments since in both experiments high temperature oxidation (HTO) reactions are observed.

While several physical and chemical factors affect the ISC performance, there is a little knowledge about how each parameter changes the ISC fate.

Six one-dimensional combustion tube experiments were conducted on three different crude oil samples; one from Mexico and two from Alberta, Canada. The combustion behavior of each crude oil sample was tested with two combustion runs; by preparing reservoir rock with only sand (E1, E3, and E5) and by preparing reservoir rock with 3 wt% clay and 97 wt% sand mixture (E2, E4, E6). The combustion characteristics were monitored with temperature profiles, produced gas compositions, and produced liquid yields. The level of in-situ oil upgrading were determined by comparing the viscosities of produced oil samples with the original ones. The results showed that the catalytic effect of the clay controls the combustion front propagation, the fuel formation, and the produced oil quality. Clays visualized on postmortem samples in the shape of lumps indicate that clay alteration occured at elevated temperature due to interaction of clay with crude oil and due to thermal decomposition of clay. It was observed that the lump formation was associated with mainly saturates and asphaltene contents of initial oil and asphaltene-clay interaction during fuel formation. Our results support that the clay presence in reservoir rock had an impact on ISC performance. However, this impact did not have a linear trend and the response of the catalytic effect of clays were different from one crude oil to another; while one crude oil favored combustion more with the presence of clay, the other did not and led to lower oil production by producing more gas.

Our ultimate goal is to estimate the variations in the chemical reactions occurring during in- situ combustion (ISC) within a reservoir which has heterogeneously distributed fluid saturations. Thus, six combustion tube experiments are conducted at varying initial water (Swi=0%, 16%, and 34%) and oil (Soi=34%, 54%, and 84%) saturations. The best performances are achieved for high initial oil and water saturation cases. The dominance of the low temperature oxidation (LTO) reactions is observed in the experiment with the intermediate water saturation (16%). The combustion front for the experiments without water (Swi=0%) could not sustain. The combustion tube results are further investigated with the reaction kinetics experiments. Hence, ISC experiments are simulated by TGA/DSC at constant (5, 10, and 15 °C /min) and varying (observed during combustion tube experiments) heating rates. The combustion tube tests suggest that water is a critical component which maintains the sustainability of the combustion process. The reaction kinetics experiments reveal that at the latent heat, interaction of steam with bitumen enhances the burning characteristics of bitumen. If the combustion front temperature (~ 400 °C) is reached with low heating rates (5 °C /min), the LTO reactions lead the formation of several different types of fuel which cannot generate sufficient heat to maintain the sustainability of combustion. Hence, LTO products adversely affect the performance of ISC for the cases which had insufficient heat generation or no initial water. However, higher heating rates (10-20 °C /min) lead the formation of more effective fuel which can generate more heat upon cracking at higher temperature ranges and maintains the sustainability of the combustion front. Because at lower initial oil and at no water saturation cases lower heating rates are observed during ISC experiments, ISC could not sustain. And, since at higher initial oil saturation with the existence of initial water saturation cases higher heating rates are witnessed during ISC experiments, the combustion process could maintain sustainability. Therefore, we recommend the injection of water to the zones with lower initial water saturations prior to field application of ISC to increase the heating rate of ISC zones. "

This analysis provides additional alternatives for CO2 storage due to the uneconomical exploration and the vast extension of heavy oil resources. CO2 streams (re)injected for storage may contain impurities such as nitrogen, water, and light hydrocarbons, particularly for flue gases and CO2-rich natural. These impurities greatly affect CO2 solubility trapping mechanisms and storage effectiveness. This work investigates the phase behavior of reservoir fluids during injection of CO2 with impurities for storage into two low API gravity oils; 12° (San Ardo heavy oil) to 8.2° (Athabasca extra-heavy bitumen). Numerical studies are conducted using the Peng-Robinson Equation-of-State with Volume-Translation and evaluating Vapor-Liquid and Vapor-Liquid-Liquid equilibria, with rigorously implementation of mutual solubility water-hydrocarbons-CO2. Simulations are conducted at typical reservoir conditions and at high pressure/high temperature synthetic scenarios. The effect of impurity concentration is represented constructing pseudo-ternary diagrams. Results show that C3-CO2 mixtures may achieve miscibility at low pressures. In the presence of N2 and C1 as impurities, miscibility with crude oil was found to be affected negatively. The water presence also affects the solubility. Introduction Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in oil reservoirs is a well-known carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) alternative to reduce the environmental footprint of CO2 emissions [1, 2]. Though high purity CO2 injection is ideal to maximize storage. The industrial activities (e.g. flue gas and CO2-rich natural gas) or carbon capture plants are usually the sources of impure CO2, containing N2, H2, O2, H2S, water, and light hydrocarbons [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Such impurities present an economic challenge to CCS as current CO2 capturing technologies to achieve high-purity streams are expensive, costing 12-60 US$/tCO2 and accounting for up to two-thirds of the total CCS project cost [2, 7, 8]. Hence, the impure CO2-rich streams may be disregarded for storage and contribute even further to CO2 emissions if vented or flared. An alternative is storing these impure gases in their raw state in uneconomic unconventional oil reservoirs. The low API gravity crude oils account for approximately 70% of the world’s oil reserves [9]. Mature heavy oil fields not subjected to thermal recovery methods could be a good potential for CCS [10].

                    "abstract": "The knowledge of how CO2 interacts with reservoir fluids and rock is essential for effective and reliable CO2 storage. This work investigates CO2 storage in unconventional oil reservoirs with high asphaltene content and explains the CO2 storage mechanism in pore-scale. Considering that asphaltenes are insoluble in CO2, asphaltene precipitation is induced during CO2 injection, controlling CO2 solubility and capillary trapping mechanisms. In this study, CO2-oil interaction is examined through core flooding experiments in a high asphaltene content (34.3 wt%) Canadian bitumen sample with 8.8º API. To study how irreversible clay-asphaltene interaction affects CO2 capillary trapping, the reservoir rock is prepared with and without clay addition. The role of CO2 injection rate on solubility trapping with experiments at varying injection flow rates. Displaced fluids and postmortem samples are subjected to several analyses to observe the CO2 storage mechanisms in pore scale due to CO2-asphaltene and CO2-clay-asphaltene interactions. It was found that CO2-clay-asphaltene interaction may favor CO2 capillary trapping into high asphaltene content reservoirs. Reservoir clays play important roles in porosity and permeability reduction due to clay interactions with asphaltenes. The low CO2 flow rate was found to favor solubility trapping. Therefore, our results suggest that the presence of clays and the CO2 injection rate are critical parameters controlling the effectiveness of CO2 storage in high asphaltene content reservoirs. Introduction Underground carbon dioxide (CO2) storage projects usually target the depleted light oil and natural gas fields due to operational expertise, favorable geological features, and existence of infrastructure [1; 2]. However, as CO2 emissions are projected to increase in the next 35 years [3], other storage alternatives are required to mitigate environmental impacts. In this context, CO2 storage in unconventional oil reservoirs with low API gravity may be an attractive candidate on the short to medium term [4; 5]. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a proven technology that is implemented through injecting highly pressurized water into tight formations. The excessive amount of water use during the process poses serious environmental problems. To address this issue, we propose and study the feasibility of a new fracturing technology utilizing air injection as an alternative fracturing fluid for tight oil and gas reservoirs. Samples from Eagle Ford and Green River formations are selected to study due to their compositional differences; carbonate rich and kerogen rich, respectively. Samples were first characterized with X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) to determine their mineralogical and organic content. A special core holder was designed to visualize the fracture formation during experiments with X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT). CT scan results were analyzed for fracture formation and propagation during air injection. Experimental results show that the clay content and type during air injection play an important role on fracture formation. It has been found that the alterations in clays at elevated temperatures contribute to keep the formed fracture apertures open due to the cementing behavior of clays at high temperatures. Kerogen was found to also contribute to the formation of microfractures due to its thermal decomposition and the thermal expansion of formed gases at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the decomposition of inorganic content, especially the carbonate content of shale samples, enhances the fracture formation. Hence, all clay rich, carbonate rich, and kerogen rich shale samples show a trend that favors effective fracturing with air. CT scan results also validate the formation and propagation of these effective fractures, and CT scans taken after one day of the core flooding experiments prove that the fractures remain open even without proppant addition. Because air is an abundant, cheap, and easy to handle injection fluid, it is an attractive alternative to water for fracturing. Our experimental results support the use of air as an alternative fracturing fluid in a promising, feasible, and low cost method for fracturing tight oil and gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Knowledge of water-rock interactions on the surface of fractures is important to develop an understanding of the geological structures and changes within the formation, to determine the water pollutants in produced water during hydraulic fracturing, and to manage effectively the produced waters. To obtain this knowledge, the water-shale interaction is investigated on carbonate-rich (Eagle Ford), organic-rich (Green River), clay-rich (Barnett), and other minerals rich (Marcellus) shale samples. Crushed shale samples were exposed to water for three weeks at reservoir conditions. The water and rock samples before and after each static experiment subjected to several analyses. The change in the rock mineralogy was defined with XRD, the elemental composition of rock was determined with XPS and SEM-EDS. The water was analyzed for its anions and cations, total dissolved solids (TDS), conductivity, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and average particle sizes of colloids. The stability of the colloids are characterized with Zeta potential. It has been observed that Barnett rock is high in illite content, the greatest calcite concentration is determined for Eagle Ford rock. The sulfate source of water correlates with the atomic percent of the sulfur and oxygen elements determined through XPS analyses. The magnesium content of water correlates mainly with illite amount in the rock and calcium concentration associates with the calcite and gypsum content of the rock samples. The greatest dissolution rate belongs to the minerals which yields sulfate in the water, then, gypsum and calcite which yield calcium cation in the water come second, and the lowest dissolution rates obtained from the magnesium containing minerals mainly dolomite. TDS of the water samples shows that Green River has the least tendency to interact with water and Barnett has the greatest tendency. Zeta potential values indicate that the particles in the water interacted with Eagle Ford have the highest tendency for precipitation, since it has the lowest zeta potential value. This study provides correlations on water-rock interaction for four different shale samples. These correlations can be used to understand the water-rock interactions for different rocks by conducting simple XRD and XPS measurements only on rock samples. "

                    "abstract": "Oil recovery following in-situ combustion (ISC) is highly dependent on initial oil saturation. The mechanisms leading to this dependence are not well understood due to the complexity of the reaction pathways leading to oil upgrading. We hypothesize that this dependence can be explained through a reductionist chemical model based on Saturates, Aromatics, Resins, and Asphaltenes (SARA) fractionation. We then substantiate this model with five combustion tube experiments, and by performing SARA fractionation on produced oils. The combustion tube experiments are conducted at identical experimental conditions but varying initial oil saturations of 13%, 26%, 34%, 42%, and 53%. The produced oil samples are examined with viscosity and API gravity measurements and weight of SARA fractions. Analysis of SARA fractions is performed with Fourier Transform InfraRed Spectroscopy (FTIR). The oil recovery and the produced gas and temperature profiles are used to define the dominant reaction type that occurred throughout the experiments, namely High Temperature Oxidation (HTO) or Low Temperature Oxidation (LTO) reactions. Metal content of the produced water samples are determined with Inductive Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The highest temperature, with greatest oil recovery and the highest carbon dioxide concentration are observed in the experiment conducted with 42% initial oil saturation in which the HTO reactions dominate the reaction path. However, the higher oxygen and lower carbon dioxide yields observed during the experiments with 13% and 26% initial oil saturations indicate that those experiments are controlled mainly by the LTO reactions. The experiments which show dominance in HTO reactions produce low density but higher viscosity oil. On the other hand, a reverse relationship is observed for cases with LTO reaction dominance. The analysis of SARA fractions with FTIR displays significant variations in molecular structure of aromatic fractions only. A quantitative analysis of resins to aromatics ratio strongly correlates with the viscosity of the samples. Hence, we conclude that resins to aromatics ratio governs the viscosity reduction and the molecular structure of the aromatic fraction seems to be the leading factor of density improvement. ICP- MS analysis on produced water show that the dominance of the HTO reactions reduces the water-oil interaction, which leads to the production of more neutral pH water. ISC is one of the most efficient thermal enhanced oil recovery methods in which maximum oil recovery can be attained. However, the complexity of the chemical reactions taking place during the process make this process difficult to understand and control. In this study, we provide a reductionist chemical model based on SARA fractionation to explain the reaction pathways describing the in-situ oil upgrading mechanisms and the dependence of oil recovery on initial oil saturation.

                    "abstract": "This paper examines the wettability change during Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Expanding Solvent - SAGD (ES-SAGD). The qualitative and the quantitative analyzes of residual oil for steam and steam-solvent coinjection cases are achieved to investigate the impact of clay migration and asphaltene precipitation on wettability alteration. The solvent selection in ES-SAGD is made according to their solubility in asphaltenes; insoluble (n-hexane), soluble (toluene), and intermediate soluble (cyclohexane). Five experiments (one SAGD and four ES-SAGD) are conducted on a Canadian bitumen. Different solvent injection strategies are followed: coinjection and cyclic injection. Wettability is determined through contact angle measurements on the spent rock samples for both inside and outside steam chamber zones. Residual oil saturation is defined via solvent extraction and with a thermal method; Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). Two solvents are used for the extraction: toluene and mixture of 90%dichloromethane+10%methanol. The asphaltene fractions of the residual oil samples are further characterized by determining clay content, Solubility Profile; and carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nickel, and vanadium contents. Both the thermal and the two solvent extraction methods yield more or less the same residual oil saturations. The asphaltene content of the residual oils (22 to 27 wt%) is found lower than the asphaltene content of original bitumen (34 wt%). However, higher metal content is detected on the residual oil asphaltenes. Analysis of residual oil asphaltenes shows a significant presence of clays in the inside steam chamber region for SAGD, which inhibits effective steam chamber propagation by reducing permeability. This asphaltene-clay interaction increases the oil- wetness of the rock surface and impacts the oil production adversely. However, this effect is minimized by the addition of solvents. The wettability measurements on spent rock samples also support these findings. The elemental analysis of asphaltenes reveals that with the increase in precipitation of asphaltenes (for ES-SAGD with n-hexane), there is an increase in vanadium and nickel concentrations. In terms of asphaltene Solubility Profiles, higher polarity was found for asphaltenes originated from inside the steam chamber zone for ES-SAGD with n-hexane, where the effect of n-hexane in the vapor phase is dominant. This work shows that the effectiveness of ES-SAGD may be in part caused by contributions from wettability changes, clay migration, and asphaltene precipitation in addition to by oil viscosity reduction alone. This study provides information on the interaction of clay, asphaltenes, solvent, and steam during SAGD and ES-SAGD. It explains the behavior of clay and asphaltenes during SAGD and ES-SAGD when different solvents are used. "

                    "abstract": "The interactions of bitumen with clays are known to cause asphaltene deposition. However, the role of clay type on this interaction remains uncertain. We study this interaction for two clay types at steam temperature. Two Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) experiments at identical experimental conditions are conducted. The reservoir rock for the first experiment (SAGD1) is prepared with sand (85 wt%) and kaolinite (15 wt%) mixture and the second experiment (SAGD2) with sand (85 wt%), kaolinite (13.5 wt%), and illite (1.5 wt%). The effectiveness of the steam chamber growth does not change with the clay type, however, 15 wt% less oil is recovered with SAGD2. The possible reasons are investigated through the contact angle, particle size, zeta potential, and interfacial tension measurements on produced oil, produced water, and spent rock. The spent rock samples are analyzed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses. The contact angle measurements on the spent rock sample display the higher oil-wetness for SAGD2 than SAGD1. However, the water-wetness of illite is known to be higher than kaolinite. This unexpected result is explained by the interaction of illite and the asphaltenes from SAGD2. The asphaltenes both from produced oil and residual oil separated and qualitative analyses are conducted with Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR). FTIR results confirm the presence of clay in the produced oil asphaltenes of SAGD2. The particle size measurements along with SEM images on postmortem samples reveal that illite containing clay exhibits cementation behavior at steam temperature, hence, reduces the permeability of the system. According to the experimental results, we developed hypotheses to understand the bitumen-illite and bitumen-kaolinite interactions for SAGD. Due to the high water-wetness of illite, illite particles first interact with steam. This interaction results in cementation and forms illite lumps with sand. And then, illite lumps continue to interact more vigorously with the polar molecules (water, asphaltenes, and resins). Clay migration and production occur in both clay types, however, while kaolinite is produced in the water phase, illite containing clay due to its interaction with asphaltenes produced in the oil phase.

                    "abstract": "The rapid rise of oil production from unconventional resources due to the increase in oil demand brings several potential risks to the environment. Governments strictly regulate the oil field water use, treatment, and disposal to reduce both the environmental and the public health effects. Hence, exploration and production companies face several challenges mainly for the management of produced water originated from any water injection processes. On a global scale, the average water cut has increased to nearly 75%. And in the U.S., the water cut is even higher (i.e., 91%) which results in a severe reduction in revenue. The average cost for handling and disposing water can range from $0.50 to $16.80 per barrel of water. In fact, the oil and gas industry in the U.S. spends $5-10 billion per year for the handling of the produced water. Furthermore, this cost does not take into account the loss of hydrocarbons due to the excess production of water. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new technologies for oil and gas production which will reduce (i) the water use for the sustainability of the water resources, (ii) the environmental and health effects of the produced water and (iii) the enormous costs of the produced water management. This paper evaluates both the current strategies and future trends that are followed in the U.S. to manage the produced waters originated from hydraulic fracturing, water flooding, and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The paper first summarizes the water injection projects in the U.S. Then, the quantitative impact of each process to the human health and environment along with the differences in the quality of the produced water due to the rock-fluid interactions and the additives used in the processes are discussed. Finally, the industrial attempts on the produced water management for the reduction in water use, reuse of the produced water, and the water treatment are examined. This paper provides a critical review on current and future trends of the produced water management. The short and long term effects to the environment due to the rapid changes in the quality of the water resources are criticized. "

Thus, we start with the determination of the optimum IOS value for ISC with five combustion tube tests at identical experimental conditions but at different IOS values and the IOS value used in the best performing experiment is decided to be the optimum IOS value for the given experimental conditions. Then, the air-requirement for the field-scale application is calculated analytically. The air-requirements for the experiments which exhibit poorer performance are normalized according to the value obtained for the optimum IOS case. We observed that the fuel-deposition amount is highly affected by the IOS and decreases with IOS. Our findings show that the constant air rate used in the experiments is responsible for the performance change in ISC for varying IOS. Therefore, the air rate should be adjusted according to the estimated fuel deposition amount for the dynamic control of ISC for the field application. "

However, solvent selection is the key factor which determines the performance of ES-SAGD due to the asphaltene-solvent interaction. The change in asphaltene stability with the solvent type can have several drawbacks during ES-SAGD. Stable emulsion formation is one of these problems which have not been investigated thoroughly for ES-SAGD. In this study, we characterized both water-in-oil and oil-in-water type of emulsions originating from SAGD, SAGD with n-hexane and SAGD with n-hexane and toluene mixture experiments. These three experiments were conducted on 8.65 oAPI Canadian bitumen with 34.3 wt% asphaltene content. Structural changes in produced oil, produced water, and spent rock samples were analyzed with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Emulsions in produced oil and water samples were determined with microscopic images. The differences in emulsions were interpreted with the wettability change determined on spent rock samples. Moreover, the asphaltene fraction of produced oil samples is further analyzed with FTIR and zeta potential measurements. For produced oil, the greatest asphaltene content with more severe emulsion formations were detected on the sample originating from SAGD. In terms of stability, because the asphaltenes originating from both ES-SAGD experiments have higher zeta potential values, lower emulsion stability has been observed for the produced oil originating from ES-SAGD. In summary, the role of asphaltenes on emulsion formation has been studied for SAGD and ES-SAGD for bitumen extraction. ES-SAGD with asphaltene soluble solvents leads to the formation of less stable emulsions. "

While one-dimensional experiments are conducted at average reservoir conditions, reservoir heterogeneities may have an impact on the amount of fuel formed and, consequently, the amount of heat generated. Therefore, prior to field applications of any potential candidates, it is essential to understand the upper and lower limits of the reservoir rock and fluid properties, and how ISC functions within those limits. In this study, the effect of varying connate water saturation, initial oil saturation, clay content, permeability, and porosity are investigated with one-dimensional combustion tube experiments on different heavy crudes (8-20 °API) with asphaltene content ranging from 10 to 18 wt% for different reservoir rocks including carbonates and sandstone. Process dynamics for good and poor ISC candidates are discussed in terms of effluent gas composition, temperature profiles and histories, total experiment time, oil recovery, behavior of fluid (oil, water, steam, and gas) front movements, and the level of oil upgrading at different reservoir conditions. Fuel consumption along with air requirements are analyzed for each experiment analytically. For good ISC candidates as identified by laboratory screening, the reservoir conditions that may lead to poor ISC field performance are estimated. It is observed that the reactivity of reservoir rocks at elevated temperatures (in the presence of oxygen) and the initial oil saturation are two important parameters that influence the fate of ISC. The findings considerably advance our understanding of field-scale ISC through the evaluation and interpretation of experimental data for different reservoir conditions. "

Due to extremely high viscosities of bitumen, the most effective bitumen extraction methods are thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods such as In-situ Combustion (ISC), Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD), Steam Flooding (SF), and Hot Water Injection (HWI) which are known as environmentally unfriendly bitumen extraction methods. In this study, we investi-gated the environmental impact of in-situ bitumen extraction by ISC, SAGD, SF, and HWI, experimentally. The original oil, water, and rock, produced oil and water, and spent rock samples originated from each recovery method were analyzed through Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, Inductive Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS), pH, viscosity, and API gravity measurements. The environmental impact was investigated according to the amount and content of produced water and gas samples and the quality of oil to reduce the impact during bitumen refining. The experimental results showed that while with ISC, the least amount of water is produced; the produced water requires more severe treatment due to its high metal and sulfur contents, and low pH level. On the other hand, since the amount of the produced water for SAGD, SF, and HWI is higher, the produced water management poses handling problems. The oil production from ISC results in the greatest recovery with upgraded oil which will reduce the environmental impact for oil processing when compare to SAGD, HWI, and SF. While all processes produced more or less the same amount of gases, SAGD and SF have additional gas production due to steam generation. As conventional resources decline, it is essential to address environmental challenges to produce from these massive oil sand resources. In this study, the environmental impacts of bitumen extraction with thermal EOR were examined extensively. "

However, the environmental and economic challenges associated with steam generation limit the application of this technology. To address these issues, we investigated the effectiveness of Expanding Solvent SAGD (ES-SAGD) over base SAGD on a bitumen sample (8.8 °API). Experimental studies are conducted with a two-dimensional physical model. Different strategies for solvent injection are tested (co-injection and cyclic injection) to examine the deposition of polar fractions of the bitumen on porous media or producing polar fractions with non-polar ones. To investigate the level of oil upgrading while toluene is used as asphaltene soluble solvent, n-hexane was selected as asphaltene insoluble. Steam chamber development is monitored with temperature profiles from 47 separate positions. Steam oil ratios, solvent oil ratios, and the level of oil upgrading in terms of viscosity reduction and API gravity improvement are evaluated together. Environmental footprints of SAGD with ES-SAGD are discussed in terms of solvent toxicity, total produced greenhouse gases, and asphaltene precipitation with FTIR analysis on postmortem samples. Furthermore, the energy intensity of the processes is assessed by considering steam generation and solvent costs. This study reveals that co-injection of hydrocarbon solvents with steam enhances the steam chamber development with higher oil production rate. Moreover, ES-SAGD results in recovery of more upgraded oil and has less environment impact. We observe that the selection of the solvent type and injection strategy are the most crucial parameters for the design of hybrid SAGD process and solvent cost can be minimized by using the recycled solvent for continuous injection of solvents. High energy consumption for steam generation during SAGD process can be reduced by co-injection with steam proper solvent type at proper injection strategy. This experimental study reveals that ES-SAGD process has environmental and economic benefits over base SAGD. However, some solvents can cause undesirable effects due to the asphaltene destabilization and precipitation in production or transportation lines. Results of this work can be used to better address solvent interaction with polar components during SAGD. "

The presence of reservoir heterogeneities makes it, therefore, practically impossible to predict a set of operational parameters that would provide efficient ISC performance. Dynamic control, whereby operational parameters are adjusted based on the reservoir conditions at the predicted combustion-front position, has the potential to significantly improve ISC performance. One-dimensional combustion tube experiments are the quickest method to determine the potential candidates for ISC. However, experiments conducted at average reservoir initial conditions do not provide data on the range of required operational parameters in a heterogeneous setting. Therefore, lab-scale experiments should be extended to screening tests by evaluating the ISC performance at the upper and lower limits of the reservoir initial conditions. To pave the way for dynamic control of ISC, this study investigates the effect of varying initial water saturation and initial oil saturation with one-dimensional combustion tube experiments on a bitumen sample (7.5 °API) with high asphaltene content (~35 wt%). ISC performance change with varying initial oil and water saturations are discussed in terms of effluent gas composition, temperature profiles, total experiment time, oil recovery, behavior of fluid (oil, water, steam, and gas) front movements, x-ray cross sectional images on postmortem samples, and the level of oil upgrading at different initial fluid saturations. Our results indicate that the presence of initial water assists the combustion process and around 30% initial water enhances the ISC performance which can be maintained by steam injection prior to ISC if reservoir initial saturation is less than 30%. Moreover, initial oil saturation has been found to be the most critical parameter which defines the amount of fuel formed, and as a consequence, the heat generated. The findings provide a significant improvement in our understanding of optimum operational conditions for a range of initial fluid saturations, bringing us one step closer to dynamic control of field-scale ISC.

                    "abstract": "Around 70% of the world’s bitumen resources are deposited in Western Alberta. Surface mining is applicable only to 20% of the total reserves, and in-situ cold production can only be effective to recover the 5% of the initial bitumen in place. This low extraction yield mainly stems from the high viscosities of bitumen, which can be reduced dramatically with the application of thermal recovery. However, economically viable and technically feasible bitumen extraction with thermal methods is challenging. There are also a range of adverse environmental issues associated with thermal methods. As conventional resources decline and since conventional recovery methods are insufficient to extract unconventional reserves effectively, it is necessary to address these issues associated with thermal recovery methods. In this study, we evaluated the recovery characteristics of a Canadian bitumen (7.5 °API-53,000 cp, at 21 °C) with four thermal recovery methods. A two-dimensional physical model was used to evaluate the performances of Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Hot Water Injection (HWI) with SAGD well configuration. Steam Flooding (SF) and In-Situ Combustion (ISC) experiments were performed with two separate one-dimensional experimental set-ups. Experimental conditions were maintained identical at reservoir average conditions. The effluent gas composition, temperature profiles, oil recovery, behavior of fluid (oil, water, steam, and gas) front movements, and the level of oil upgrading were discussed by considering the environmental and economic constrains of the processes. Furthermore, core samples were extracted from the model to evaluate and visualize the sweep efficiency. Experimental findings reveal that ISC yielded the highest (~90 wt%) and HWI the lowest (~33 wt%) oil recoveries. In terms of environmental footprints, SF produced the highest amount of gases per barrel oil production, and HWI resulted in the lowest gas production. Among HWI, SAGD, and SF, energy consumption was the greatest in SAGD and the worst sweep efficiency was obtained with SF. Our results recommend a hybrid utilization of thermal recovery methods, specifically HWI with ISC for the extraction of this bitumen. HWI prepares the reservoir for ISC by aiding to increase reservoir temperature and reducing the reservoir heterogeneities with hot water distribution. "

ISC oxidizes in place a small fraction of the hydrocarbon, thereby providing heat to reduce oil viscosity and increase reservoir pressure. Both effects serve to enhance recovery. The complex nature of petroleum as a multicomponent mixture and the multistep character of combustion reactions substantially complicate analysis of crude-oil oxidation and the identification of settings where ISC could be successful. In this study, isoconversional analysis of ramped temperature-oxidation (RTO) kinetic data was applied to eight different crude-oil samples. In addition, combustion-tube runs that explore ignition and combustion-front propagation were carried out. By using experimentally determined combustion kinetics of eight crude-oil samples along with combustion-tube results, we show that isoconversional analysis of RTO data is useful to predict combustion-front propagation. Isoconversional analysis also provides new insight into the nature of the reactions occurring during ISC. Additionally, five of the 10 crude-oil/rock systems studied employed a carbonate rock. No system displayed excessive oxygen consumption resulting from carbonate decomposition at combustion temperatures.

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper increases understanding of in-situ combustion (ISC) mechanisms based on experimental results for a Central European crude oil for which ISC has proven to be economically successful. Ramped temperature oxidation (RTO), or so- called kinetics, studies measure the rate of crude-oil oxidation. Similarly, combustion tubes packed with mixtures of sand, clay, water, and hydrocarbon measure our ability to propagate a combustion front. Through the combination of the isoconversional approach for estimation of reaction kinetics (apparent activation energy Ea, Arrhenius constant or pre-exponential factor A) and implementation of combustion tube runs under different conditions, the mechanisms behind the combustion process are elucidated. The results of seven combustion tube runs are presented and discussed in terms of repeatability, effect of grain surface area, effluent gas concentration oscillations, stoichiometry, minimum air flow rate and recovery efficiency. Based on experimental results, critical parameters for field application as well as for simulation are derived (hydrogen/carbon-ratio, air requirements). Opposed to previous publications, the ISC process is described in terms of stoichiometry for the entire tube run, giving insight into development of hydrogen/carbon-ratio and other important parameters over time. This helps to compare, verify, and tune simulation results obtained from commercial simulators. Results obtained point out the exceptional efficiency of ISC in terms of recovery and fuel consumed. Monitoring combustion stoichiometry over time gives an increased insight into flue-gas composition oscillations.  Introduction Though in-situ combustion (ISC) projects have proven to be economically successful (e.g. Carcoana (1990)), industry has always been reluctant to apply ISC on a broader scale (Sarathi (1999)). Designing a field project is rather involved because of the complex nature of the process. Lab experiments, a prerequisite for screening, estimation of compressor capacity requirements, and simulations, are very challenging to be performed in a controlled environment. Ideally, kinetic cell and combustion tube experiments are carried out to determine whether or not an oil is a proper candidate for an ISC project (Cinar et al. (2009)). Kinetic cell experiments, usually carried out as RTO experiments combined with effluent gas analysis, give insight into the mechanism behind the kinetics of combustion (Cinar et al. (2009)). Combustion tube experiments are designed to study the combustion process in one dimension (Moore et al. (1997)). "

Introduction In-situ combustion (ISC) offers many potential advantages over other thermal recovery processes, including greater recovery of the original oil in place, lower production and capital costs, minimal usage of natural gas and fresh water, a partially upgraded crude-oil product, reduced diluent requirements for transportation if upgrading is sufficient, and significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions (Castanier and Brigham, 2003). In-situ combustion is a multiphysics, reactive-transport process with vigorous production of heat, carbon oxides, and steam resulting from the oxidation of a small fraction of the hydrocarbons in place. A key to well-functioning ISC is the creation of fuel that is subsequently oxidized if the flux of air is sufficient. The fuel is composed of coke and coke-like residues resulting from heating of the oil.  The ISC recovery process was initially field-tested in 1934 (Sheinman et al., 1973) and air injection projects date to the early 1900's (Prats, 1986) Since then, combustion recovery methods have been implemented in a variety of geological and geographical settings. To date, hundreds of projects around the world have been started (Karimi and Samini, 2010, Dingley, 1965). Notable field projects are Suplacu de Barcau in Romania, Balol and Santhal in India, Bellevue in Louisiana, USA, and Morgan in Lloydminster, Alberta, Canada (Mitra et al., 2010, Turta et al., 2005, Kuuskraa et al., 1983, and Marjerrison and Fassihi, 1994). The ISC process also has potential to operate in reservoirs that are greater in pressure, lower in quality, thinner and deeper, onshore and offshore, and contain significant shale (Kleindienst, 2005).

In this study, applicability of electrical heating for heavy-oil recovery from two heavy-oil fields in Turkey (Bati Raman and Camurlu) was tested numerically. The physical and chemical properties of the oil samples for the two fields were compiled, and in-situ viscosity reduction during the heating process was measured with and without using iron powder. Iron powder addition to oil samples causes a decrease in the polar components (such as carboxylic and phenolic acids) of oil, and the viscosity of oil can be reduced significantly because of the magnetic fields created by iron powders. Three different iron-powder types at three different doses were tested to observe their impact on oil recovery. Experimental observations showed that viscosity reductions were accomplished at 88 and 63% for Bati Raman and Camurlu crude oils, respectively, after 0.5% iron (Fe) addition, which was determined as the optimum type and dose for both crude-oil samples. Next, field-scale recovery was tested numerically using the viscosity values obtained from the laboratory experiments and physical and chemical properties of the oil fields compiled from the literature. The power of the system, operation period, and the number of heaters were optimized. Economic evaluation performed only on the basis of the electricity cost using the field-scale numerical modeling study showed that the production of 1 bbl petroleum costs approximately USD 5, and at the end of 70 days, 320 bbl of petroleum can be produced.

These grain arrangements cause combustion front fingering suggesting that the geomechanical state is relevant to combustion. This new data advances the knowledge base significantly by providing a data set for benchmarking of ISC simulations.  Introduction In-situ combustion (ISC) is a thermal recovery process in which a small amount of oil is combusted in place that aids the displacement of the remaining oil by releasing thermal energy and gases (e.g., Alexander et al., 1962; Brigham and Castanier, 2007; Ursenbach et al. 2010). In the field, the ignition is started with an electrical or down-hole gas burner, and in some cases auto ignition (T reservoir > 180 oF) can be achieved (Tadema and Weijdema, 1970). The combustion is sustained by injecting air or an oxygen rich gas into the formation. The oil is driven toward the producer by the vigorous combustion gas, steam, and water drive (Sarathi, 1998). The water drive results from water of combustion and recondensed formation water. This process is also called fire flooding to describe the movement of a burning front inside the reservoir. Based on the respective directions of front propagation and air flow, the process can be forward, when the combustion front advances in the same direction as the air flow, or reverse, when the front moves against the air flow (e.g., Akin et al., 2000; Brigham and Castanier, 2007). In this study, we focus on dry forward combustion.  As the combustion front moves away from the injection well, several well characterized zones develop in the reservoir between the injector and producer. These zones are the result of heat and mass transport and the chemical reactions that occur during forward in-situ combustion process (Castanier and Brigham, 2003). Although small (10's cm) in spatial extent, the coking zone and the subsequent combustion zone are key to effective combustion. In a linear sense, the combustion zone moves the most slowly. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Cyclic steam injection into representative, low-permeability, hydraulically fractured, diatomaceous, heavy-oil formations is investigated using reservoir simulation. Previous laboratory research has shown that diatomite reservoir rocks exhibit temperature-dependent wettability. Water-oil and liquid-gas relative permeability are varied here and a reservoir simulator used to evaluate the effects on oil recovery. Sensitivity studies are carried out for relative permeability curves compiled from literature for diatomaceous reservoirs. The various parameters included in the analysis are relative permeability end points and viscosity variations with increasing temperature, rock and fluid properties (such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity), injected steam temperature, pressure, and quality, bottomhole pressure for injectors and producers. The results indicate that the liquid-gas relative permeability affects process performance most sensitively because gas displacement determines the shape of the heated zone during cyclic steam injection. For the recovery of heavy oil from diatomaceous formations, realistic evolution of the liquid-gas relative permeability at steam temperatures increases the oil recovery in the range of 15 to 60% of the OOIP in comparison to cases with no evolution of wettability with temperature. Very short two week cycles (inject-soak-produce) make more oil and show greater sensitivity to the evolution of wettability with temperature.  Introduction Cyclic steam injection is a thermal recovery process that enhances recovery by reducing oil viscosity so that well productivity increases (Sarathi and Olsen, 1992). A cyclic steam injection process includes three stages: injection, soaking, and production. The cycle is repeated as long as oil production is profitable (Sarathi and Olsen, 1992). Cyclic steaming is used extensively in heavy-oil reservoirs, tar sands, to improve injectivity prior to steamflood, and in some cases to prior in-situ combustion operations (Sarathi and Olsen, 1992). Cyclic steaming as well as steamdrive has been applied successfully to low permeability reservoirs, such as diatomite, containing heavy and light oil (Kumar and Beatty, 1995; Kovscek et al., 1996a&b; Murer et al., 2000).  Diatoms are single-celled (unicellular) organisms that live as individuals or in groups called colonies. They exist in both salt and fresh waters (Antonides, 1998). When diatoms die, their silica shells accumulate on the floor of the body of water in which they lived. Thick layers of diatom shells have been fossilized in rock. Such layers, or beds, of diatoms are called diatomaceous earth, or diatomite (Diabira et al., 2001). Diatomite pore throats range from order 0.001 µm to order 10 µm (Jia et al., 2007). Accordingly, permeability is extremely low, ranging from 0.01 to 10 md (Kumar and Beatty, 1995; Jia et al., 2007). The rock is also a moderately soft and fragile mineral with porosity up to 70 percent. High porosity samples filled with air are light enough to float on water.  Although diatomite reservoirs are rich in oil resources (Ilderton et al., 1996), low permeability frustrates oil production. Because of the low matrix permeability, wells are hydraulically fractured. Waterflooding and cyclic steam injection are implemented successfully using hydraulic fractures (Kumar and Beatty, 1995; Kovscek et al., 1996a&b; Murer et al., 2000).  There are several parameters affecting the performance of cyclic steam injection such as reservoir geology, oil gravity, and initial conditions (Schembre et al., 2006 and Kumar and Do, 1990). There is still limited information even about the basic petrophysical properties of reservoir rocks at elevated temperature (Nakornthap and Evans, 1986). Relative permeability affects the performance most among the various input process modeling parameters (Stone, 1970 and Sato and Aziz, 1987). Oil-water and gas-liquid relative permeabilities are properties that are important and necessary in describing the mechanisms of thermal recovery (e.g., Dietrich, 1981, Davidson, 1969, Ayatollahi et al., 2005, and Hamouda and Karoussi, 2008).

                    "abstract": "Archie developed his model of resistivity in hydrocarbon-bearing rocks by applying trend analysis to resistivity index – water saturation data, and separately to formation resistivity factor – porosity data. He then combined the separate trends by eliminating a common parameter, R0. This produces a serviceable empirical model for the relationship between brine resistivity, porosity, water-saturation, and the bulk resistivity of a rock. However, Archie is silent regarding any underlying physics which might have supported his model. The industry appears to have been incurious as to the physical foundations of the Archie model for 40 years following its introduction. In 1981, Sen published what he called a “Derivation of Archie from First Principles”. However, his derivation is based upon Tetsuya Hanai's mixing rule for dilute spheres (mineral grains) in a homogenous background (brine), and in the end the porosity exponent Sen derives is m = 3/2. It seems questionable whether a mixing rule qualifies as a first principle, and the exponent obtained is quite unrocklike. Results of subsequent attempts to derive the Archie model from first principles by a variety of methods have been equally equivocal. Kennedy (2007) used Archie's own Nacatoch sandstone data set to derive, by inspection, an alternative formula with a constant, equal to two, exponent and an adjustable parameter playing the role of a percolation threshold. Kennedy and Herrick (2012), starting with three first principles (or self-evident axioms) derived a similar but not identical formula, also depending upon a percolation threshold-like parameter. Further work has shown that, when porosity is recharacterized as “connected porosity participating in conduction” that, not only can the seemingly different formulas from 2007 and 2012 be reconciled, that the Archie model is also brought into agreement with the two models of Kennedy and Herrick. The new model, although it includes total porosity as a parameter, recognizes that not all of the brine in the pore space participates in conduction, and that the bulk conductivity of the rock depends not on the total porosity but only on the fractional volume of the conducting porosity. When the first principles are adjusted to account for this nonconducting fraction of the pore volume, the normalized conductivity (i.e., reciprocal formation resistivity factor) is proportional to this “conducting connected” porosity and to a geometrical factor whose form is easily correlated to the “connected” porosity. The result is formally identical to the Archie model with a porosity exponent, m = 2. With this substitution, the formulas of Kennedy and Herrick from 2007 and 2012 take a form identical to the Archie equation. I will claim that this constitutes the first derivation of the Archie model from unequivocal first principles, making the arguments of Kennedy and Herrick for their formulas also applicable to the Archie model, providing the Archie model a sound physical footing for the first time.

Archie invented an empirical method of interpreting the log measurements quantitatively in terms of a relationship between porosity, resistivity, and water saturation. In the decades following Archie's discovery, a relative handful of investigators, among them M. R. J. Wyllie and Walter Rose, William Winsauer and his colleagues, and Monroe Waxman and L. J. M. Smits invested much effort in trying to un-derstand and extend the Archie model by a com-bination of laboratory and thought experiments, and our modern industry-standard paradigms for resistivity interpretation incorporate the ideas that these pioneers introduced. However, it can be fairly said that neither these pioneers, nor those who have followed have done much to illuminate the physics of conduc-tion in rocks, and much misinformation has come to be accepted as fact, at least among working formation evaluators. The major reason for the confusion is that each of the models proposed by the pioneers men-tioned above has unrecognized flaws. When their work is taken together in an effort to under-stand the electrical behavior of rocks the result is confusion. However, when the flaws in the models due to Wyllie and Rose, Winsauer and colleagues, and Waxman and Smits, are identified, it is possible to construct a conceptual model that avoids the flaws, and that also can be easily understood in physical terms. Our paper points out the flaws in the models of Wyllie and Rose, Winsauer and colleagues, and Waxman and Smits, and models derived therefrom, and shows how the flaws continue to contribute to confusion in under-standing and interpretation of formation resistiv-ity relationships. It also illustrates how the flaws in the first two models can be removed, and that the repaired models are both equivalent to the geometrical factor theory of D. C. Herrick. It is also shown that when properly understood, Waxman and Smits can be reformulated into a logically correct theory, but whose parameters, unfortunately, are not amenable to measurement. "

                    "abstract": "Recurrent themes can be found in the history of mathematics and physics, and science in general, among them the development of ideas from intuitive concepts and qualitative arguments that are at a later date validated by subsequent, more rigorous, analysis. Indeed, many times it has been the empirical success of a qualitatively justified theory that has motivated the development of more rigorous methods. So has it been with the development of a conductivity theory for petroleum reservoir rocks. Like Newton when declining to expound on the cause of gravity (“Hypotheses non fingo”), Archie makes no hypothesis as to reason for the success of his functions relating water saturation to porosity, brine resistivity, and bulk rock resistivity. Excepting a few attempts in the 1950s, serious investigation into the physics of conduction in rocks did not begin until 40 years following Archie's seminal work. These second attempts at explanations were based upon effective media theories, but when applied to rocks these are approximations, and have not led to “first principles” models. D. C. Herrick and W. D. Kennedy (1993) proposed a model stating: “The conductivity , σt of a water-bearing rock composed of non-conducting minerals, and which may contain hydrocarbons displacing some of the original water from its intergranular pore-space, is a function of the conductivity of the conducting phase (usually brine) σw, porosity φ, fractional volume occupied by the conducting phase φSw, and spatial distribution, or geometry, of the conducting phase; i.e., σt = f (σw, φ, Sw, geometry).” As a functional form they proposed σt = σwφSwEt with being an explicit geometrical factor intended to account for the effects of the brine geometrical distribution upon bulk rock conductivity. In 2012, C. F. Berg published an article “Re-examining Archie's law: Conductance description by tortuosity and constriction”. Berg, beginning with infinitesimal elements of conducting brine volume, integrates these elements into tortuosity and constriction factors describing the conductance of the porous medium. In this paper we show that the combined effect of the tortuosity and constriction factors developed by Berg is identical to the geometrical factor Et of Herrick and Kennedy. The convergence of these results puts the geometrical factor theory on a rigorous analytical footing, moving theoretical petrophysics past raw empiricism to analytical rigor. "

While this is painfully obvious during the current industry downturn, available evidence suggests that even when the industry is profitable, e.g., during the decade prior to the most recent downturn, it still performs substantially below its expectations and its potential (Nandurdikar 2014). Many attribute this underperformance to cognitive biases in project evaluation, resulting in poor project selection and valuation. McVay and Dossary (2014) presented a simplified framework to estimate the cost of underestimating uncertainty. They demonstrated that chronic overconfidence and optimism (estimated distributions of project value too narrow and shifted positively), common in industry, produce substantial disappointment (difference between estimated and realized portfolio values), also common in industry. In this work, we generalized their framework to include full estimated distributions (e.g., normal or lognormal), instead of the truncated distributions they employed. In addition, we extended their framework to model underconfidence (estimated distributions too wide), and demonstrate that underconfidence is just as detrimental to portfolio performance as overconfidence. Decision error will be minimized and portfolio value will be maximized when there is no bias in project estimation—i.e., neither overconfidence nor underconfidence and neither optimism nor pessimism. Using either framework, we demonstrate that operators can quantitatively measure biases—overconfidence, underconfidence, optimism and pessimism—from lookbacks (comparing actual performance to probabilistic forecasts) and generation of calibration plots. Once aware of the direction and magnitude of biases, operators have means for eliminating these biases in subsequent forecasts through a combination of internal correction of uncertainty assessments, via training or ongoing feedback, and external correction of forecasts using measurements of bias from calibration results.

                    "abstract": "An energy producer must determine optimal energy investment strategies in order to maximize the value of its energy portfolio. Determining optimal energy investment strategies is challenging. One of the main challenges is the large uncertainty in many of the parameters involved in the optimization process. Most existing large-scale energy models are deterministic and so have limited capability for assessing uncertainty. Modelers usually use scenario analysis to address model input uncertainty. In this paper, we describe a coarse probabilistic model developed for optimizing energy investments and policies from an energy producer's perspective. The model uses a top-down approach to probabilistically forecast primary energy demand. Distributions rather than static values are used to model uncertainty in the input variables. The model can be applied to a country-level energy system. It maximizes portfolio expected net present value (ENPV) while ensuring energy sustainability. The model is built in MS Excel® using the @RISK add-in, which is capable of modeling uncertain parameters and performing stochastic simulation optimization. The model was applied to synthetic data for a typical fossil-fuel-dependent country to determine its optimum energy strategy. For this synthetic case, the model suggests that the subject country should increase its oil production capacity slightly higher than its current level, increase its gas production, and meet most of its future power generation (electricity) demand using alternative energy sources—nuclear, solar, and wind. A primary contribution of this work is rigorously addressing uncertainty quantification in energy modeling. The model could be applied, with minor modification, by either companies or countries to assist in determining optimal energy investment strategies. "

                    "abstract": "Management It is clear the oil and gas industry recognizes the large uncertainty in which it operates. A search in the OnePetro technical paper database using the keywords “uncertainty” or “risk” returns more than 53,000 conference and journal papers. Yet, it is also clear that the industry does not know how to reliably assess uncertainty and that this inability negatively affects industry performance. Capen (1976) described the difficulty of assessing uncertainty. He pointed to massive capital overruns and low industry returns due to an almost universal tendency to underestimate uncertainty. Brashear et al. (2001) and Rose (2004) later documented the dismal performance of the industry in the last 10 to 20 years of the 20th century due to chronic bias and evaluation methods that do not account for the full uncertainty. Although industry profitability may have improved in the past decade because of high oil prices, Neeraj Nandurdikar in an October 2014 JPT article, “Wanted: A New Type of Business Leader to Fix E&P Asset Developments,” showed that the oil and gas industry continues to perform significantly below estimations and expectations. He cited three ways that assets erode value, all of which relate to unreliable assessments of uncertainty: (1) production and reserves estimates are overestimated, (2) capital costs are underestimated, and (3) development times are underestimated. And these do not include price estimations; the surprising oil price slide at the time of this writing has the potential to move industry performance from below expectations to below profitability. While project evaluations can be affected by many different types of biases, these can be reduced fundamentally to two primary biases: overconfidence and directional bias. Overconfidence is underestimation of uncertainty; i.e., our estimated distributions of uncertain quantities, such as reserves, are too narrow. They are too narrow because we do not consider all the possible outcomes. There is considerable evidence in the literature, both inside and outside the petroleum industry, of our general human tendency for overconfidence. Directional bias results when the subset of possible outcomes considered is shifted in either the optimistic or pessimistic direction. There is also evidence that we are usually optimistic in our overconfidence; i.e., we fail to consider some possible negative outcomes, or we give greater weight to possible positive outcomes than possible negative outcomes. As a result of the two primary biases, we make decisions with incorrect estimated distributions rather than true distributions (Fig. 1). "

                    "abstract": "Several analytical decline-curve models have been developed recently for shale-gas wells (Ilk et al. 2008; Anderson et al. 2010; Valko and Lee 2010). However, these authors did not quantify the uncertainty in production forecasts and reserves estimates. This is important because most shale plays are in the early stages of production and virtually any method will have large uncertainty when there are limited production data available. Jochen and Spivey (1996) and Cheng et al. (2010) developed bootstrap methods that can generate probabilistic decline forecasts and quantify reserves uncertainty. Hindcasts with the modified bootstrap method (MBM) (Cheng et al. 2010) provide good coverage of the true cumulative production. However, the authors did not show they can quantify reserves uncertainty with limited production data in unconventional plays. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian probabilistic methodology using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) combined with Arps’ decline-curve analysis. We tested this model on two data sets: Barnett shale horizontal-well gas production with more than 7 years of history and Eagle Ford shale horizontal-well oil production with more than 1 year of history. In both cases, P50 hindcasts were very close to true cumulative production and P90 and P10 hindcasts quantified the cumulative production uncertainty reliably with as little as 6 months of production available for matching. In this Bayesian methodology, the decline-curve parameters qi, Di, and b are assumed to be random variables instead of parameters to be modified to obtain a best fit. A Markov chain of the decline-curve parameters is constructed by use of MCMC with the Metropolis algorithm (random walk). We developed the model by performing hindcasts with the Barnett case study consisting of 197 horizontal gas wells with more than 7 years of production. The prior distribution, proposal distribution, and likelihood function were calibrated so the probabilistic decline curves quantified the cumulative-production uncertainty reliably with as little as 6 months of data. The same model was then tested with analysis of Eagle Ford shale oil production from 536 wells; the probabilistic decline curves quantified the cumulative-production uncertainty reasonably well by changing only the prior distribution. The proposed Bayesian methodology provides a means and a workflow to generate probabilistic decline-curve forecasts and quantify reserves uncertainty in shale plays quickly and reliably. This Bayesian methodology can also be applied with other analytical decline-curve models if desired. "

                    "abstract": "Despite the perception of lucrative earnings in the petroleum industry, various authors have noted that industry performance is routinely less than expectations. For example, Brashear et al. (2001) noted that average return was approximately 7% in the 1990s, despite the use of typical project-hurdle rates of at least 15%. The underperformance is generally attributed to poor project evaluation and selection because of chronic bias. Although other authors have investigated cognitive biases in oil-and-gas (O&G) project evaluation, there have been few quantitative studies of the impact of biases on economic performance. We suggest that incomplete investigation and the possible underestimation of the impact of biases in project evaluation and selection are at least partially responsible for persistence of these biases. The objectives of our work were to determine quantitatively the value of assessing uncertainty or, alternatively, the cost of underestimating uncertainty. In this paper, we present a new framework for assessing the monetary impact of overconfidence bias and directional bias (i.e., optimism or pessimism) on portfolio performance. For moderate amounts of overconfidence and optimism, expected disappointment (ED) was 30 to 35% of estimated net present value (NPV) for the industry portfolios and optimization cases that we analyzed. Greater degrees of overconfidence and optimism resulted in EDs approaching 100% of estimated NPV. A comparison of modeling results with industry performance in the 1990s indicates that these greater degrees of overconfidence and optimism have been experienced in the industry. The value of reliably quantifying uncertainty is reducing or eliminating ED (realizing an NPV is substantially less than estimated NPV) and expected decision error (EDE) (selecting the wrong projects). Because biases are usually related, mitigating one bias will often mitigate others in the process. ED and EDE can be reduced by focusing on the elimination of either overconfidence or optimism, although there is an advantage to focusing on overconfidence. The elimination of ED will improve overall industry performance to the extent that superior projects are available and that better quantification of uncertainty allows identification of these superior projects.

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been proposed as a fast and reliable probabilistic method to quantify uncertainty regardless of the decline curve analysis model employed and the amount of production data available for forecasting. In this paper, we integrate other sources of information with PDCA in a Bayesian framework to enhance the reliability of production forecasts for hydraulically fractured horizontal shale gas wells. Hindcasts using the logistic-growth-curve model coupled to MCMC and two different sources of prior information were performed to assess the reliability of the improved PDCA method. In a hindcast, only a portion of the historical data is matched; predictions are made for the remainder of the historical period and compared to the actual historical production. The logistic-growth-curve model was moderately well calibrated when used with the MCMC probabilistic method and a non-informative prior, regardless of the amount of production data available to match. When EUR distributions from other sources of information were provided as an informative prior, accuracy and calibration of the probabilistic production forecasts were further enhanced. The use of informative prior distributions improves calibration particularly when little production data are available. The combination of the MCMC method, the logistic-growth DCA model, and use of prior EUR distributions provides an integrated procedure to reliably quantify the uncertainty in production forecasts in shale gas reservoirs.  Reliable quantification of uncertainty should yield more reliable expected values of reserves estimates. This can be particularly valuable early in the development of a play, because decisions regarding continued development are based to a large degree on production forecasts for early wells in the play.

Well construction cost estimates often contain high levels of uncertainty. In many cases, these costs are estimated using deterministic methods that do not reliably account for uncertainty, leading to biased estimates. The objectives of this work were to improve the reliability of deterministic well construction cost estimates by incorporating external probabilistic methods into the estimation process. The method uses historical well cost estimates and actual costs to develop probabilistic correction factors that can be applied to future well cost estimates. These factors can be applied to the entire well cost or to individual cost components. Application of the methodology to estimation of well construction costs for horizontal Barnett shale wells in the Fort Worth basin resulted in estimated well cost estimates that were well-calibrated probabilistically. Overall, average estimated well cost using this methodology was significantly more accurate than average estimated well cost using deterministic methods. The methodology is intended for use by individual engineers to improve their well construction cost estimation and by management to externally revise and improve well cost estimates for budgeting purposes. Systematic use of this methodology will provide for more accurate and efficient allocation of capital for drilling campaigns, which could have significant impacts on reservoir development and profitability.

However, one of the most uncertain aspects of shale gas development is our ability to accurately forecast gas resources and shale gas development economics. The uncertainty of the problem begs for a probabilistic solution. The objective of our work was to develop the data sets, methodology and tools to determine values of original gas in place (OGIP), technically recoverable resources (TRR), recovery factor (RF) and economic viability in highly uncertain and risky shale gas reservoirs. Existing approaches for determining values of TRR, such as the use of decline curves or even volumetric analyses, may not be reliable during early time because there may not be enough production history for decline curves to work well or the uncertainty in the reservoir properties may be too large for volumetric analyses to be useful. To achieve our research objective, we developed a computer program, Unconventional Gas Resource Assessment System (UGRAS). In the program, we integrated Monte Carlo technique with an analytical reservoir simulator to estimate the original volume in place, predict production performance and estimate the fraction of TRR that are economically recoverable resources (ERR) for a variety of economic situations. We applied UGRAS to dry gas wells in the Barnett Shale and the Eagle Ford shale to determine the probabilistic distribution of their resource potential and economic viability. Based on our assumptions, the Eagle Ford shale in the dry gas portion of the play has more technically recoverable resources than the Barnett shale. However, the Eagle Ford shale is currently not as profitable as the Barnett shale because of the higher drilling costs in the Eagle Ford dry gas window. We anticipate that the tools and methodologies developed in this work will be applicable to any shale gas reservoir that has sufficient data available. These tools should ultimately be able to allow determination of technically and economically recoverable resources from shale gas reservoirs globally. "

                    "abstract": "One major source of new natural gas supplies for the world will be gas from low-permeability reservoirs. Currently, natural gas from tight sandstones, carbonates, coal seams and shales accounts for over 25% of the annual gas production in the United States. Global production of gas from similar reservoirs world wide will be expected in the next few decades. For such reservoirs, the wells have to be successfully fracture treated to produce at commercial gas flow rates. In many situations, the designed created length was probably achieved, and maybe even the designed propped length was achieved. However, due to insufficient proppant concentration, or insufficient proppant transport, or the use of the wrong propping agent, or a fracture fluid that does not break to a low viscosity fluid, the effective fracture length is significantly less than the designed length and does not provide optimal production results. It is our opinion that insufficient fracture fluid cleanup is the primary cause of poor results when the optimal effective fracture length is not achieved. Fracture fluid cleanup is affected by gel damage, which includes the static yield stress, the flowing yield stress, the amount of polymer residue in the fracture after the fracture closes, and the amount of polymer that forms a filter cake on the walls of the fracture. In addition, there are other issues such as proppant crushing and non-Darcy flow effects that also affect fracture fluid cleanup. In this research, we have used a reservoir simulator to model how polymers in the fracture affect fracture fluid cleanup. We have incorporated mathematical expressions for static yield stress. We have included the effects of proppant crushing, gel residue plugging and the formation of a filter cake on the cleanup behavior and the resulting gas flow rates. With our model, we are able to simulate many of the problems we observe in field data and problems documented in the petroleum literature. Even though real solutions to these problems still remain to be developed, we think we can explain the issues behind most fracture fluid cleanup problems and offer a few ideas on what can be done to solve them.

That global estimate is most likely quite conservative because the oil and gas industry has discovered enormous volumes of shale gas around the world since the 1990s. The data from these new reservoirs add substantially to our understanding of the unconventional resource base. Furthermore, the uncertainty of Rogner's assessment was not quantified. Thus, considering the uncertainty, a new assessment of original unconventional gas in place worldwide is needed. The objective of this project was to estimate the probabilistic distributions of original volumes of gas trapped in coalbed, tightsand, and shale reservoirs worldwide. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed published assessments of coal and conventional and unconventional resources and established the quantitative relationship between unconventional gas [coalbed methane (CBM), tight-sands gas, and shale gas] and the conventional hydrocarbon (coal, conventional gas, and oil) resource endowments for North America. Then, we used this relationship to extrapolate original unconventional gas in place worldwide. Our assessment of the world resource endowment established an unconventional OGIP of 83,400 Tcf (P10) to 184,200 Tcf (P90), which is 2.6 to 5.7 times greater than Rogner's estimate of 32,600 Tcf. Our regional assessments of unconventional OGIP should help industry better target its efforts to rapidly accelerate the development of unconventional gas resources worldwide. The methodology used to assess the distribution of each type of unconventional OGIP may be used to estimate unconventional gas resources at the country or basin level, given knowledge of the coal in place and technically recoverable resources of conventional hydrocarbons.

                    "title": "The Value of Assessing Uncertainty",
                    "abstract": "Despite the perception of lucrative earnings in the oil industry, various authors have noted that industry performance is routinely below expectations. For example, Brashear et al. (2001) noted that average return was around 7% in the 1990s, despite using typical project hurdle rates of at least 15%. The underperformance is generally attributed to poor project evaluation and selection due to chronic bias. While a number of authors have investigated cognitive biases in oil and gas project evaluation, there have been few quantitative studies of the impact of biases on economic performance. We believe that incomplete investigation and possible underestimation of the impact of biases in project evaluation and selection are at least partially responsible for persistence of these biases. The objectives of our work were to determine quantitatively the value of assessing uncertainty or, alternatively, the cost of underestimating uncertainty. In this paper we present a new framework for assessing the monetary impact of overconfidence bias and directional bias (i.e., optimism or pessimism) on portfolio performance. For moderate amounts of overconfidence and optimism, expected disappointment was 30-35% of estimated NPV for the industry portfolios and optimization cases we analyzed. Greater degrees of overconfidence and optimism resulted in expected disappointments approaching 100% of estimated NPV. Comparison of modeling results with industry performance in the 1990s indicates that these greater degrees of overconfidence and optimism have been experienced in the industry. The value of reliably quantifying uncertainty is reducing or eliminating expected disappointment (having realized NPV substantially less than estimated NPV) and expected decision error (selecting the wrong projects).  Expected disappointment and decision error can be reduced by focusing primarily on elimination of overconfidence; other biases are taken care of in the process. Elimination of expected disappointment will improve industry performance overall to the extent that superior projects are available and better quantification of uncertainty allows identification of these superior projects.  Introduction A number of authors have documented the chronic underperformance of the oil and gas industry relative to expectations. Brashear et al. (2001) reported that the return on net assets by the largest U.S.-based E&P companies was only 7%, after selecting projects with hurdle rates of generally 15% or more, which were all financed with cost of capital generally in the range of 9-12%. According to Rose (2004), in the last 20 years of the 20th century, E&P companies delivered only about half of predicted reserves. From 1990 to 2000, the S&P 500 had an average annual return of 16%, almost double E&P companies at 9%. The top 25 international E&P companies from 1996-2002 averaged only 11% return on exploration investment. While performance may have improved in the last decade, this may be due more to high oil prices during this period rather than systematic improvement in business processes. It is even possible that high oil prices have caused the industry to relax and have made decision making worse. Merrow (2011) reported that since 2003, the rate of success for megaprojects (>$1 billion) remained constant at about 50% for non-petroleum projects, while the success rate for petroleum megaprojects declined from 50% to 22%. Why does the industry underperform? Brashear et al. (2001) attributed it, at least in part, to use of evaluation methods that do not account for the \"full?? uncertainty. Rose (2004) indicated that \"by far, the dominant cause of E&P underperformance is an internal problem…: Chronic bias in estimating key geotechnical parameters that control our evaluation of E&P projects.?? According to Begg et al. (2003),\"Uncertainty is the underlying cause of the failure of many decisions to deliver their promised technical and economic metrics.?? Is the problem the uncertainty itself? We do not believe so; uncertainty will always be present. Indeed, Leach (2006) says that uncertainty is the ultimate source of value in business. If not uncertainty itself, is the problem that our processes for decision making under uncertainty are suboptimal, or is it that we do a poor job of quantifying the uncertainty? We believe both contribute, but the latter is the greater contributor. "

                    "abstract": "Arps' deterministic decline curve analysis has been the industry standard for forecasting production and estimating reserves despite its subjectivity and potentially large uncertainty, particularly early in well life. Probabilistic decline curve analysis (PDCA) methods have been proposed to quantify the significant uncertainty in reserves estimation in shale gas plays. However, all the published PDCA methodologies have been tested using Arps' decline curve model. New decline curve analysis (DCA) models have been developed for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. However, these models have been primarily applied deterministically, without quantification of uncertainty. We performed hindcast tests of six DCA models presented in the literature (Arps, Arps with a minimum decline, modified Arps, Power Law, Stretched Exponential, and Duong) with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) probabilistic methodology with different amounts of production data. Our results show that the MCMC probabilistic method reliably quantifies the uncertainty in production hindcasts and cumulative production estimates for decline curve models developed for shale gas wells. Even with DCA models based on Arps' equations, the probabilistic methodology is reasonably well calibrated. Hindcast uncertainty decreases as the amount of matched production data increases, but the MCMC probabilistic method is reasonably well calibrated regardless of the amount of production data matched. Furthermore, the MCMC probabilistic method yields P50 estimates that are more accurate than deterministic estimates at early times. Uncertainty will always be present in production forecasts and reserves estimates and uncertainty can be quite large early in the producing lives of shale gas reservoirs. Reliable quantification of uncertainty can improve decision making in early stages of production, which can lead to more efficient exploitation of these reservoirs.  Introduction There is considerable uncertainty in production forecasting and reserves estimation for hydraulically fractured, horizontal shale gas wells. Methodologies that can reliably quantify the uncertainty are needed to allow better decision making by operators in the early development and production stages of shale gas reservoirs. Capen (1976) pointed out that by performing a probabilistic analysis, we can usually obtain better estimates than using a purely deterministic methodology. Nevertheless, probabilistic decline curve methodologies are still not widely used in the industry, either because they are time consuming or hard to implement. Major sources of uncertainty in shale gas production forecasts and reserves estimates include complex flow geometry, large variability in reservoir and completion properties from well to well, and lack of long-term production data. Shale gas reservoirs possess extremely low matrix permeability. For this reason, shale reservoirs require massive hydraulic fracture treatments to become economical (Agrawal et al. 2012). There are also natural fractures in shale, which can play an important role in formation of hydraulic fracture geometry and depletion of the reservoirs (Gale et al. 2007). There is also possible desorption dynamics of adsorbed gas (Mengal and Wattenbarger 2011). All of these phenomena result in complex flow geometry, which contributes to uncertainty in production forecasting and reserves estimation. "

                    "abstract": "Since Hubbert proposed the \"peak oil\" concept to forecast ultimate recovery of crude oil for the US and the world, there have been countless debates over the timing of peak world conventional oil production rate and ultimate recovery. Forecasts presented in the literature can be grouped into those that are like Hubbert's, with an imminent peak, and those that do not predict an imminent peak. Although both groups have bases for their positions, viewpoints from the two groups are polarized and the debate is often heated. A big reason for the large divide between the two groups is the failure of both to acknowledge the significant uncertainty in their estimates. Although some authors attempt to quantify uncertainty, most use deterministic methods and present single values, with no ranges. Our objective is to quantify the uncertainty in estimates of world conventional ultimately recoverable resources (URR) and time to peak oil rate. We use two different methodologies. First, we employ a mathematical modeling technique based on regression of historical production data using Hubbert's logistic model and a normal distribution model. However, we conduct the analyses probabilistically, considering errors in both the data and the model, which results in likelihood probability distributions for URR and time to peak rate. Second, we use a multiple-experts analysis to combine estimates from the multitude of papers presented in the literature, yielding an overall distribution for estimated world URR. Both the mathematical modeling and the multiple-experts analysis indicate that there is considerable uncertainty in estimates of world conventional oil URR. Our best estimate is a P10 - P90 range of 1.8 - 4.4 trillion bbl with a mean of 2.9 trillion bbl. Because of some conservative assumptions in our analysis, we believe the uncertainty is actually greater than indicated above, and the additional uncertainty is in the upside, resulting in larger P90 and mean values. In short, we do not have enough information at this time to say with reliability what the ultimate world conventional oil recovery will be. It could peak soon, somewhere in the distant future, or somewhere in between. It would be wise to consider all of these possible outcomes in planning and making decisions regarding capital investment and formulation of energy policy. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Under pre-2009 SEC reserves reporting guidance, filers with the SEC had difficulty in persuading the SEC staff that reservoir simulation met the ‘reasonable certainty' standards required to classify resources as proved reserves. With the modernization of the SEC's reserves reporting rules, 'reliable technology,' including computational methods, is allowed to establish the certainty level required for reporting reserves of any category. However, important questions arise: can we consider reservoir simulation to be a reliable technology? If so, what conditions must be satisfied to establish reliability? This paper concludes that simulation is indeed a potential reliable technology when we can demonstrate that it satisfies the criteria of consistency and repeatability, difficult criteria to satisfy for a computational method. The paper also concludes that the reserves analyst can demonstrate when simulation is reliable by proceeding through the steps in the scientific method outlined by Sidle and Lee (2010a) which provide guidelines to establish that a particular technology in question is consistent with the definition of a reliable technology.  At the reasonable certainty level required for proved reserves, we must demonstrate with empirical evidence that estimates of EUR based on simulation are much more likely than not to increase or remain constant as more historical data become available. For 2P (proved plus probable) reserves, we must demonstrate that EUR forecasts are as likely as not as more reservoir performance data become available, and for 3P reserves, EUR forecasts must remain possible though not likely. Empirical evidence that the required level of certainty has been achieved can come from either ‘hind-casting' (successfully predicting the future based on only a portion of historical data) or from demonstrated success from applying the same simulation technology in analogous reservoirs, in which the same level of rigor was applied to ensure that the geological model or models used as the basis for simulation is appropriate and that it honors all available information.  When the industry broadly accepts reservoir simulation as a reliable technology (when applied appropriately) suitable for use in reserves disclosures and when it provides persuasive arguments about reliability to regulatory agencies, the interests of all stakeholders in reserves disclosure efforts will be enhanced.

                    "abstract": "As gas production from conventional gas reservoirs in the United States decreases, the industry is turning more attention to the exploration and development of unconventional gas resources (UGRs). This trend is expanding quickly worldwide. However, unlike in many mature North American basins where significant development of UGRs is now routine, many countries are just turning to UGRs exploration. Insightful resource assessment is important for tapping UGRs in these frontier basins. To evaluate the UGRs in frontier basins that are underexplored, we developed basin analysis methodology to 1) characterize basins; 2) establish analogs between frontier basins and mature North American basins; 3) estimate conventional and unconventional resources in mature North American basins; and 4) quantitatively predict UGRs in frontier basins by using information from analogous North American basins. This comprehensive basin analysis study not only validates the resource triangle, which is characterized by a large ratio of unconventional TRR (technically recoverable resources) to conventional TRR, but also makes it possible to quantitatively assess unconventional resources in under-explored basins worldwide. To demonstrate use of basin analysis in evaluating the UGRs of frontier basins, two world hotspots for UGRs exploration were selected as the target basins: Neuquén basin in South America and Berkine basin in North Africa. Recent assessment reports and exploration activities indicate that the two basins have substantial unconventional gas resources. As a case study, basin analysis was used to identify the North American reference basins that are analogous to the Neuquén and Berkine basins, and to characterize the distributions of UGRs in these frontier basins. Furthermore, the quantitatively estimated unconventional TRR were compared with those from EIA (Energy Information Administration) and companies to support the effectiveness of basin analysis results.  Introduction Unconventional resources encompass a broad range of oil and gas deposits that have been bypassed for decades because they were not considered economically feasible to produce. While discussions of peak oil and the limitations placed on production by many foreign countries continue, US companies have quickly moved toward unconventional resources as a viable source of oil and gas production. Advances in exploration, drilling and completion technologies in the past 20 years have led to the opening of new areas in the domestic U.S. targeting unconventional resources. In 2009, tight gas production amounted to roughly 31.5 percent of the total U.S. natural gas production; shale gas and coalbed methane accounted for 15.5 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively (EIA, 2011a). Recently, this surge in developing recoverable unconventional natural gas has also greatly impacted many countries and regions outside the US. For example, a recent study by EIA (2011b) reports initial assessments of technically recoverable shale gas resources in 32 foreign countries. However, these foreign countries are just now beginning to understand and plan the assessments of unconventional gas resources in the frontier basins with very limited information. To evaluate UGRs in frontier (or target) basins where the resources have been underexplored, assessments have been conducted on basin characterization, basin analogy, quantification of UGRs in NA (North America) reference basins, and estimates of UGRs volumes in the frontier (or target) basins (Singh et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2011a, 2011c). These results were integrated to arrive at a frontier basin analysis estimate of UGRs. Generally, the approach identifies the NA reference basins that are analogous to a frontier basin, and then uses the resource distributions in the analogous basin to estimate the distribution and volume of UGRs in the frontier basin (Table 1).

                    "abstract": "Abstract During the past decades, investigation of unconventional gas resources has become a significant area due to its promising outlook of meeting the future energy needs. When the unconventional gas resources, especially those in frontier basins, expose a set of challenging issues that both knowledge and practice are very limited, basin analog analysis has been employed for preliminary assessments of frontier plays.  For basin analog, it compares a comprehensive spectrum of features between the target basin and reference basin, and this process involves large-volume data with broad value ranges. To rapidly and effectively evaluating the unconventional hydrocarbon resource potential in frontier basins (i.e., the target basins), basin analog approach has been proposed since 2008, in combination with a database populated with well-characterized geologic and petroleum systems information of North America basins that have significant unconventional resource development (i.e., the reference basins). The continuing investigation has been based on the public literature, and it is noted that data of many petroleum systems are incomplete that cannot cover the entire comprehensive parameters. This problem is inherently typical of the unconventional basins: many unconventional petroleum systems are newly developed and the characterization data are unavailable; or the unconventional basins, especially for the frontier basins, are exploratory with many plays undeveloped or in the very early development stage. Another major problem in analyzing basin analog is that parameters are usually multi-valued due to the wide range of petroleum systems.  In this paper, we analyzed the previous approaches of basin analog analysis and proposed an improved solution to the problems. The improved method is based on extracting the characterized parameter distributions in basin scale, and compares distributions by using probability theory and information theory. This method can not only solve the incomplete analog and multi-value comparison problems to achieve more accurate results, but also directly reflect the quantified distributions of different parameters in multiple basins simultaneously. Also discussed are validation of the analogous relationships by basin resource distributions and the further usage of the improved basin analog analysis for estimating unconventional resource volumes in frontier basins.  Introduction Why analog? When there is only limited knowledge on the new object of interest, it is an intuitive thinking to try to connect the object with the well-known objects. This analog method is commonly used in the field of geosciences, where geologists have traditionally employed analogy to support their interpretations. Such usage includes the frequently-quoted principle \"the present is the key to the past?? or the statement \"that the best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks?? (McCormick, 1999). As a supplementary analysis, the geological analog is helpful to characterize the less accessible reservoirs and compliment the field model.  The analog method also applies to the analysis for unconventional gas resources in frontier basins: while resources and reserves are well characterized in many North American basins that have significant UGR (Unconventional Gas Resources) development, most basins outside North America (i.e., frontier basins) are underexplored with little information about the unconventional resources. Therefore, the analog method provides a way to understand the frontier basin by comparing the basin with the mature North American basins. Moreover, the basin analog discussed in the paper goes beyond the geologic characteristics, but incorporates large amounts and diverse types of data concerning both geology and engineering information. These comprehensive parameters are important components to support the quantified estimation of volume and guide the exploration decisions. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In shale plays, as with all reservoirs, it is desirable to achieve the optimal development strategies, particularly well spacing, as early as possible, without overdrilling. This paper documents a new technology that can aid in determining optimal development strategies in shale reservoirs. We integrate a decline-curve-based reservoir model with a decision model that incorporates uncertainty in production forecasts. Our work extends previous work by not only correlating well spacing and other completion parameters with performance indicators, but also developing an integrated model that can forecast production probabilistically and determine the impact of development decisions on long-term production.  A public data set of 64 horizontal wells in the Barnett shale play in Cooke, Montague and Wise Counties, Texas, was used to construct the integrated model. This part of the Barnett shale is in the oil window and wells produce significant volumes of hydrocarbon liquids. The data set includes directional surveys, completion and stimulation data, and oil and gas production data. Completion and stimulation parameters, such as perforated interval, fluid volume, proppant mass, and well spacing, were correlated with decline curve parameters, such as initial oil rate and a proxy for the initial decline rate, the ratio of cumulative production at 6 months to 1 month (CP6to1), using linear regression. In addition, a GOR model was developed based on thermal maturity and average GOR versus time. Thousands of oil and gas production forecasts were generated from linear regression and GOR models using Monte Carlo simulation, which serve as the input to the decision model. The decision model then determines the impact of well spacing and other completion/stimulation decisions on long-term production performance.  The technology introduced in this paper can be used to help operators in unconventional reservoirs reach optimal spacing and completion strategies earlier in the lives of these reservoirs, which could accelerate production and increase reserves.  Introduction Since the successful application of horizontal drilling and slick water fracturing in shale plays, interest in shale reservoirs has increased significantly. It is important for operators to identify optimal development strategies in the early stages of development, but this is difficult when there is little production data and limited understanding of reservoir properties and production mechanisms (Lee and Sidle, 2010). Statistical moving-window techniques have been employed to identify optimal well spacings in unconventional gas plays (Gao and McVay, 2004; Voneiff and Cipolla, 1996). However, the moving-window techniques are typically applied deterministically and hence cannot quantify the significant uncertainty inherent in shale plays.  Turkarslan et al. (2010) introduced an integrated model using stochastic reservoir simulation and decision analysis to optimize well spacing and quantify reserves uncertainty in unconventional gas reservoirs. However, the method is computationally intensive and requires significant amounts of data to relate reservoir and completion/stimulation parameters to production performance. LaFollette and Holcomb (2011) performed an extensive data-mining study in the Barnett shale in an effort to relate production performance directly to completion and stimulation parameters; however, the relationships discovered were not used for production forecasts and hence to optimize development strategies.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Along with the trend that unconventional gas resources are significant in meeting the great energy demand, it is intuitively needed to know their quantified volume, especially for the frontier basins where little exploration of unconventional resources has been undertaken. Following by our work in standardized investigation and quantified evaluation of recoverable resources in 25 mature North American basins, this paper further employs two methods to evaluate TRR (Technically Recoverable Resources) for unconventional gas in frontier basins: Source Rock method (SR) and Conventional TRR Input method (CTRRI).  The source rock method derives from the fact that source rock potential is the mechanism for generating hydrocarbons. Thus, using the relationships between TRR and source rock factors, the SR can adequately capture TRR from the indirect source rock evaluation. Combined with the ratio of unconventional and conventional hydrocarbons from our prior investigations, the method can further deduce conventional resources and unconventional resource volumes. Different from SR that provides an independent measure of TRR, conventional TRR input method requires known recoverable conventional resources for frontier basin. To calculate frontier basin TRR volume, the frontier basin's recoverable conventional volume is divided by the fraction of conventional resources in the similar reference basin from basin analog system investigation (BASIN). It is noted that all the quantifications are regulated by the unified definition from petroleum resource investigation summary and evaluation (PRISE). Although the two methods estimate TRR for frontier basins in different conditions, the initial tests on three basins show that estimates by CTRRI are in accordance with those by SR. The results validate the resource triangle concept with distributions of different resource types (i.e., conventional oil, conventional gas, coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight gas sand), and can be further evaluated by more complete estimation of North American basin resources and international unconventional gas resources.  Introduction Currently it is clear that there is an enormous volume of oil and gas in unconventional reservoirs, and these resources in the tight reservoirs, the coal seams and the shales are expected to be significant in fulfilling the global energy demand, just as they have already played a major role in the U.S. gas supply in recent years (Martin et al. 2010). To evaluate the feasibility of developing these resources, it is important to estimate the volume of TRR (Technically Recoverable Resources).  TRR are resources producible using current recovery technology but without reference to economic profitability (Schmoker, 2005), and can be combined with other key values (e.g., gas in place and economically recoverable resources) to determine how to proceed with investment and development. In particular, the preliminary estimates of technically recoverable unconventional resources are important for making economic and development strategy in frontier basins worldwide, where little unconventional resource exploration has been undertaken and thus the knowledge and experience is very limited.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Several analytical decline curve models have been developed recently for shale gas wells (Anderson et al. 2010; Ilk et al. 2008; Valko and Lee 2010). However, despite the considerable uncertainty associated with forecasting shale gas production, these authors either do not quantify the reserves uncertainty in shale gas wells or fail to demonstrate that their probabilistic forecasts are well calibrated. Jochen and Spivey (1996) and Cheng et al.(2010) developed bootstrap methods that can generate probabilistic decline forecasts and quantify reserves uncertainty. Forecasts with the Modified Bootstrap Method (Cheng et al. 2010) provide good coverage of the true reserves. However, it is not time efficient because it requires hundreds of Newton iterations for each well. In this work, we introduce a Bayesian methodology for probabilistic decline curve analysis that quantifies reserves uncertainty reliably, quickly, and without modifying the historical production data. We analyzed 167 horizontal gas wells with more than 7 years of production in the Barnett shale to validate the methodology.  In this Bayesian methodology, the decline curve parameters qi, Di, and b are assumed to be random variables instead of parameters to be modified to obtain a best fit. A Markov chain of the decline curve parameters is constructed using MCMC with the Metropolis algorithm. In the test of 167 Barnett shale horizontal gas wells, we assume that the first half of production is known and the second half of production is unknown and acts as \"future production.?? Approximately 85% of the 167 wells' \"future production?? falls in the range of P90 and P10 reserves generated by this Bayesian methodology, indicating the method is well calibrated, and the Bayesian method is 13 times faster than the modified bootstrap method.  The proposed Bayesian methodology provides a means to generate probabilistic decline curve forecasts and quantify the reserves uncertainty in shale gas plays quickly and reliably. This Bayesian methodology can also be applied with other analytical decline curve models if desired.  Introduction Arp's (1945) decline curve model have been used extensively for estimating reserves in shale gas plays despite significant uncertainty associated with decline curve forecasts in these wells. Several new analytical decline curve models have been developed to estimate reserves (Anderson et al. 2010; Ilk et al. 2008; Valko and Lee 2010). Ilk et al. (2008) introduced the power-law decline curve to model the decrease in the decline exponent b with time; however, they did not attempt to quantify the significant uncertainty in shale gas well production forecasts. Valko and Lee (2010) introduced the stretched exponential production decline curve and used it to quantify the uncertainty in field production forecasts; however, they did not quantify the uncertainty in single-well reserves estimates based on the existing production. Anderson et al. (2010) introduced an analytical decline curve based on linear flow theory introduced by Wattenbarger et al. (1998). The probabilistic decline curves Anderson et al. generated are based on different assumed matrix permeabilities, but the method was tested with only 3 wells, which is not a large enough sample to determine if the method is well calibrated probabilistically.

Thus, a new assessment of original unconventional gas in place worldwide with considering the uncertainty is needed.  The objective of this project was to estimate the probabilistic distributions of original volumes of gas trapped in coalbed, tight sand and shale reservoirs, worldwide. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed published assessments of coal, conventional and unconventional resources and established the quantitative relationship between unconventional gas (coalbed methane, tight sands gas, and shale gas) and the conventional hydrocarbon (coal, conventional gas and oil) resource endowments for North America. Then, we used this relationship to extrapolate original unconventional gas in place, worldwide. Our assessment of the world resource endowment established an unconventional OGIP of 83,400 Tcf (P90)-184,200 Tcf (P10), which is 2.6-5.7 times greater than Rogner's estimate of 32,600 Tcf.  Our regional assessments of unconventional OGIP should help industry better target its efforts to rapidly accelerate the development of unconventional gas resources worldwide. The methodology used to assess the distribution of each type of unconventional OGIP may be used to estimate unconventional gas resources at the country or basin level, knowing the coal in place and technically recoverable resources of conventional hydrocarbons.  Introduction As the world reserves of liquid hydrocarbons from conventional reservoirs peaks and begins to decline, natural gas will play an increasingly important energy supply role. However, as the use of natural gas increases, additional supplies will be needed. To obtain additional natural gas supplies, the industry can develop unconventional gas resources that are often overlooked in the search for conventional hydrocarbons. Higher natural gas prices and significant technological advances have led to a dramatic increase in production of unconventional gas resources in the US in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue unabated and to expand worldwide.  Strong oil and gas demand is pushing coalbed methane exploration and production outside of North America. In countries such as Australia and China, coalbed methane will become an important energy source in the future. In many other countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, coalbed methane potential and commercial aspects of coalbed methane production are not understood yet (Chakhmakhchev 2007).  Tight sands gas represents a significant portion of natural gas resources worldwide. Large reserves of tight sands gas have been identified outside of North America, such as in India, China, and several European countries. Currently, there is an emerging focus on tight sands gas reservoirs in the Middle East and North Africa to supply the growing energy needs in this region and to save the oil from conventional resources for export and generation of hard currencies.  A number of major and independent oil and gas companies are circling the globe looking for high-quality shale-gas plays. Currently, shale-gas exploration is underway in many parts of the world, including in the Alum shale of Sweden, the Amadeus shale in Australia, and the carbonaceous shales of Botswana. Since the delineation of shale gas is still in its infancy, global shale-gas resources have not been appraised in any systematic way. "

                    "abstract": "On occasion, a hydraulically fractured tight-gas well does not perform up to its potential because of slow or incomplete fracture-fluid cleanup. A number of papers have been written to address individual factors related to fracture-fluid cleanup, but many questions as to which factors mostly affect gas production from such wells remain unanswered. Numerical reservoir simulation is one of the best methods to study the fracture-fluid-cleanup problem. Continuing from our previous publication (Wang et al. 2008) on the effect of gel damage on fracture cleanup, we used reservoir simulation to analyze systematically the factors that affect fracture-fluid cleanup and gas recovery from tight-gas wells. We first developed a comprehensive data set for typical tight gas reservoirs and then ran single-phase-flow cases for each reservoir and fracture scenario to establish the idealized base-case gas recovery. We then systematically evaluated the following factors: multiphase gas and water flow, proppant crushing, polymer filter cake, and, finally, yield stress of concentrated gel in the fracture. The gel in the fracture is concentrated because of fluid leakoff during the fracture treatment. We evaluated these factors additively in the order listed. We found that the most important factor that reduces fracture-fluid cleanup and gas recovery is the gel strength of the fluid that remains in the fracture at the end of the treatment. This paper illustrates the complexity of the fracture-fluid-cleanup problem and points out the need to use reservoir simulation and to include all the pertinent factors to model fracture-fluid cleanup rigorously. The procedures presented can provide a useful, systematic guide to engineers in conducting a numerical simulation study of fracture-fluid cleanup. "

                    "abstract": "Most reservoir-simulation studies are conducted in a static context--at a single point in time using a fixed set of historical data for history matching. Time and budget constraints usually result in significant reduction in the number of uncertain parameters and incomplete exploration of the parameter space, which results in underestimation of forecast uncertainty and less-than-optimal decision making. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been used in static studies for rigorous exploration of the parameter space for quantification of forecast uncertainty, but these methods suffer from long burn-in times and many required runs for chain stabilization. In this paper, we apply the MCMC in a real-time reservoir-modeling application. The system operates in a continuous process of data acquisition, model calibration, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification. The system was validated on the PUNQ (production forecasting with uncertainty quantification) synthetic reservoir in a simulated multiyear continuous-modeling scenario, and it yielded probabilistic forecasts that narrowed with time. Once the continuous MCMC simulation process has been established sufficiently, the continuous approach usually allows generation of a reasonable probabilistic forecast at a particular point in time with many fewer models than the traditional application of the MCMC method in a one-time, static simulation study starting at the same time. Operating continuously over the many years of typical reservoir life, many more realizations can be run than with traditional approaches. This allows more-thorough investigation of the parameter space and more-complete quantification of forecast uncertainty. More importantly, the approach provides a mechanism for, and can thus encourage, calibration of uncertainty estimates over time. Greater investigation of the uncertain parameter space and calibration of uncertainty estimates by using a continuous modeling process should improve the reliability of probabilistic forecasts significantly.

The volume of UG resources is generally unknown in most basins outside North America. However, in many mature North American basins, UG resources have been produced for decades, and resources and reserves are well characterized. The objective of this work was to determine the quantitative relations between known conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources in mature North American basins, with the ultimate goal of using these relations to estimate UG resources in frontier basins outside North America. We used assessments by the US Geological Survey (USGS), Potential Gas Committee (PGC), Energy Information Administration (EIA), National Petroleum Council (NPC), and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to evaluate relations among hydrocarbon-resource types in the Appalachian, Black Warrior, Greater Green River, Illinois, San Juan, Uinta-Piceance, and Wind River basins. We chose these seven basins for initial analysis of relations between CG and UG resources because they are mature basins for both conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. To conduct this analysis, we wrote a computer program that we call Petroleum Resources Investigation Summary and Evaluation (PRISE). Input data for PRISE, obtained from published data sources and resource assessments, were values of technically recoverable resources, consisting of the following resource categories: (1) cumulative production, (2) proved reserves, (3) probable and possible reserves and contingent resources (PPC), and (4) prospective resources. We then analyzed these data in each of the seven basins to assess the relationship between conventional- and unconventional-resource volumes. For the seven basins studied, we found that approximately 10 - 20% of the total recoverable hydrocarbon resources are conventional oil (CO) and CG, whereas 80 - 90% of the recoverable hydrocarbons are UG resources. We suggest that the results of this study may be used to estimate recoverable resources from UG reservoirs in frontier basins worldwide, where CO and CG resources are known but UG resources have not been evaluated.

                    "abstract": "Analysts have increasingly used probabilistic approaches to evaluate the uncertainty in reserves estimates based on decline-curve analysis (DCA). This is because the results represent statistical analysis of historical data that usually possess significant amounts of noise. Probabilistic approaches usually provide a distribution of reserves estimates with three confidence levels (P10, P50, and P90) and a corresponding 80% confidence interval (CI). The question arises: How reliable is this 80% CI? In other words, in a large set of analyses, is the true value of reserves contained within this interval 80% of the time? Our investigation indicates that it is common in practice for true values of reserves to lie outside 80% CIs much more than 20% of the time using traditional statistical analyses. This indicates that uncertainty is being underestimated, often significantly. Thus, the challenge in probabilistic reserves estimation using DCA is not only how to appropriately characterize probabilistic properties of complex production-data sets, but also how to determine and then improve the reliability of the uncertainty quantifications. This paper presents an improved methodology for probabilistic quantification of reserves estimates using DCA and practical application of the methodology to actual individual-well decline curves. Application of our proposed new method to 100 oil and gas wells demonstrates that it provides much wider 80% CIs than methods previously presented, and these CIs contain the true values approximately 80% of the time. In addition, the method yields more-accurate P50 values than previously published methods do. Thus, the new methodology provides more-reliable probabilistic reserves estimation, which has important impacts on economic risk analysis and reservoir management. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes and validates a robust methodology to estimate fracture properties (half-length and conductivity), formation permeability, and, where possible, drainage area of individual layers in hydraulically fractured vertical gas wells producing commingled from multiple layers. Estimation of these fracture and individual layer properties is required to evaluate fracture treatment effectiveness and forecast future production for these wells.  To achieve our objectives, we applied an analytical elliptical flow solution to analyze production data from hydraulically fractured vertical tight gas wells producing from multilayer reservoirs. We were able to estimate the fracture half-length, formation permeability, and minimum drainage area of each layer. This study considered variations in completion details, initial reservoir pressures, reservoir temperatures, and other reservoir parameters in layers producing simultaneously.  The technology we developed includes the following components used in our analysis: flow rate allocation using available production logging test data, deconvolution to convert variable-rate pressure data into constant-rate pressure responses, identification of the elliptical flow regime, and analysis of elliptical flow data. We developed and present a new technique to identify the elliptical flow regime. We validated our method with synthetic data generated with a reservoir simulator.  Introduction Tight gas reservoirs have low permeabilities and porosities, and are considered unconventional sources of natural gas because they require hydraulic fracture treatments to produce commercial volumes and rates of gas. Most tight gas wells are drilled in multilayer reservoirs and completed with multiple fracture treatments. Reservoir and fracture parameters such as formation permeability, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity and minimum drainage area of each layer are required to evaluate the fracture treatment efficiency, optimize future hydraulic fracturing stimulation design, and forecast well flow behavior and performance. Typically, production data analysis techniques are used to estimate these properties for a hydraulically fractured well, but without production information for individual layers, these estimates have to be lumped into single-layer properties.  For commingled production from multiple layers, different flow regimes coexist in different layers because of variations in formation permeability and fracture half-length, which complicates the flow behavior of the well-reservoir system. As a result, it is very difficult to reliably estimate properties of individual layers using either conventional analytic or history matching techniques with limited PLT data. Unfortunately, it is the general case that only a few PLTs are available. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Despite our increased experience, unconventional gas plays remain risky. In the face of this risk, operators must balance the need to conserve capital and protect the environment by avoiding over drilling with the desire to maximize profitability by achieving the optimal well spacing as quickly as possible. Previous unconventional gas developments such as the Carthage Field (Cotton Valley) have implemented multiple infill drilling programs over several decades to optimize well spacing, with significant reduction in value (McKinney et al. 2002). However, in emerging plays such as the non-core Barnett Shale and the Fayetteville Shale, historical infill programs are not available to evaluate optimal spacing and we do not have the luxury of developing these fields over the next 30-40 years. Existing approaches for optimizing development, such as integrated reservoir simulation studies or statistical moving-window methods, can be either prohibitively time-consuming and expensive or they do not consider the uncertainty inherent in the assessment.  The objective of our work was to develop technology and tools to help operators determine optimal well spacing in highly uncertain and risky unconventional gas reservoirs as quickly as possible. To achieve the research objectives, we developed an integrated reservoir and decision modeling system that incorporates uncertainty. We used Monte Carlo simulation with a fast, approximate reservoir simulation model to match and predict production performance in unconventional gas reservoirs. Simulation results are then integrated with a Bayesian decision model that accounts for the risk facing operators. We applied these integrated tools to a hypothetical case based on data from Deep Basin (Gething) tight gas sands in Alberta, Canada, to determine optimal development strategies.  We anticipate that the tools and methodologies developed will be applicable in most shale and tight gas reservoirs. These tools should ultimately be able to help operators determine, for example, the combination of primary development strategy (well spacing and/or completion method) and testing (pilot downspacings and/or tests of other completion methods) that maximizes future profitability. The optimal design of such programs in unconventional reservoirs, where the risks are high, is likely to pay large dividends.  Introduction The rapid growth in world energy demand and the higher depletion rates of existing oil and gas reserves have initiated a gap between conventional energy demand and supply (Zahid et al. 2007). To bridge this fast-growing energy gap and create a sustainable future energy supply, the global petroleum industry is investing heavily in exploration and development of unconventional energy resources.  In North America, federal tax credits and technical development programs led by private organizations, public companies and government agencies were implemented to facilitate the advancement of technology related to unconventional natural gas exploration and exploitation. With the advancement of technology in the fields of geosciences, drilling, completion and production, accompanied by increasing gas prices in the early- to mid-2000's, interest in shale gas, tight gas sands and coalbed methane has grown significantly (Xiong and Holditch 2006).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Today, many countries are evaluating unconventional gas resources, which are estimated to exceed 30,000 trillion cubic feet, worldwide. Owing to declining conventional gas production, the U.S. has led the world in development of unconventional gas resources (UGR) and technology over the past 3 decades. To facilitate transfer of unconventional gas technology and development internationally, we developed a software, FAST (Formation Analog Selection Tool), as a tool to objectively and rapidly identify and rank analog formations. FAST software uses an existing database (BASIN) that contains geoscience and engineering parameters for approximately 240 formations in 25 North American basins that are mature for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. We designed a FAST report module that provides both general and detailed interpretation graphs and tables. FAST reports give an overview of analog results, and they allow insights into the quantitative details of reservoir parameters comparisons. Although the software needs further validation, preliminary testing shows consistent results. Planned and ongoing improvements to FAST include quality checking of formation parameters in the database, assessment of parameter weighting factors, validation of the analog selection performance against the literature and independent studies regarding analog formations, and linkage of FAST with a Drilling & Completion Advisory System to identify the best engineering practices to be applied in early stages of testing analogous target formations.  Introduction The distribution of oil and gas resources may be illustrated using the resource triangle (Fig. 1). The apex of the resource triangle represents the relatively small volumes of conventional resources that occur in reservoirs that are relatively easy and inexpensive to develop. The base of the triangle represents unconventional resources, which include tight gas sands, coalbed methane, shale gas, gas hydrates and heavy oil (Holditch 2005). Unconventional resources account for very large volumes of hydrocarbons in place, but unconventional reservoirs are comparatively difficult and expensive to develop, requiring greater technology applications and higher commodity prices to surpass economic hurdles. As conventional gas production has declined, unconventional gas production has been the largest source of recent U.S. gas supply growth, and 9 of 12 top-producing natural-gas fields in the U.S produce unconventional gas (Haskett 2005). Outside the U.S., many countries and regions are beginning to evaluate unconventional reservoirs. Many Asian countries, for example, are assessing the potential of unconventional gas reservoirs to help meet their growing energy demands in the next 30 years (Terasaki 2005). It is clear that unconventional resources will be important in meeting future world energy demands and, given the huge potential of unconventional resources (Rogner 1997), interest in unconventional reservoir characterization and evaluation is growing (Aguilera 2007).

                    "abstract": "Abstract As gas production from conventional gas reservoirs in the United States decreases, the industry is turning more to the exploration and development of unconventional gas resources (UGR), especially shale gas reservoirs. This trend is expanding quickly worldwide. Unlike in many mature North American basins, where resources and reserves are well characterized, the volume of unconventional gas resources is generally unknown in most basins outside North America (frontier basins). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of North American unconventional gas resources is significant not only for identifying and understanding the quantitative distributions of recoverable UGR in North American basins, but also for estimating the volume of UGR in frontier basins. Our investigation of North American unconventional gas resources is based on the resource triangle concept, which implies that all natural resources, including oil and gas, are distributed log-normally in nature. Martin et al. (2010) described a methodology to estimate values of total recoverable resources (TRR) for unconventional gas reservoirs. In their work, the authors combined estimates of production, reserves, reserves growth, and undiscovered resources from a variety of sources into a logical distribution. They used data from 8 basins in North America to demonstrate their results. We have expanded the work of Martin et al. (2010) to include data from a total of 25 basins in North America. The results show that the overall ratio of TRR in unconventional gas reservoirs to those in conventional oil and gas reservoirs in the 25 basins is approximately 4 to 1. This means that for every Tcfe of oil and gas produced from conventional reservoirs, one could expect another 4 Tcfe to be technically recoverable from unconventional gas reservoirs in the same basin. This observation can help companies assess the potential of unconventional gas resources development in North American basins and in frontier basins worldwide.  Introduction Driven by a new understanding of the potentially huge amount of unconventional gas resources (UGR) and the feasibility of unconventional gas development, global interest in the development of unconventional gas reservoirs has been on the rise during the last few years. In North America, unconventional resources have been produced for decades and play a major role in the national energy picture. Around the world, UGRs can be found in every major oil and gas basin, but have yet to serve as the major contributor for energy supply, partly due to the scarcity of information about the exploration and development technologies required to produce UGRs (Holditch et al. 2007). Also, there are many factors, such as service company infrastructure, gas markets and low gas prices in some areas, which will inhibit development any time soon. However, to fulfill the growing global energy demand, unconventional resources outside of North America will receive more attention in coming years. To better evaluate the UGRs in North America, Martin et al. (2010) developed the software system Petroleum Resources Investigation Summary and Evaluation (PRISE). PRISE used data from 8 basins to assess total recoverable resources (TRR) in unconventional gas reservoirs (UGR) (Martin et al. 2010). In this paper, we expand the work of Martin et al. (2010) to include data from 17 additional North America basins that contain significant volumes of gas in UGRs.  PRISE Software. We improved the software developed by Martin et al. (2010) and added data from more basins in North America. The upgraded PRISE database includes evaluations of 25 North American basins, and is designed to assess the volume of gas in UGRs in frontier basins. PRISE works in conjunction with another program, BASIN, which can be used to find the North American basin most analogous to any frontier basin (Singh et al. 2008). BASIN and PRISE share a common database (Fig. 1). Once the analogous basin has been determined, PRISE uses the resource distribution of the analogous North American basin to infer the resource distribution of the frontier basin. PRISE and BASIN are components of a more general set of programs called the Unconventional Gas Advisor (UGA) (Fig. 1). "

                    "abstract": "Laboratory experiments of gas injection in organic rich shales have resulted in significant oil recovery. In Part I (Tovar, Barrufet, and Schechter 2018), we presented an operational philosophy to maximize the recovery factor using a huff and puff injection scheme at the highest possible pressure, regardless of the MMP value. This paper focuses in the impact that fluid transport in organic rich shale has on the recovery mechanisms under gas injection and provides the rationale behind the proposed operational philosophy. We used CT-scanning data from nine coreflooding experiments conducted by injecting CO2 in organic rich shale sidewall cores, two injecting N2, and three further tests of CO2 injection in Berea sandstone thus providing a baseline for comparison to high permeability rock. The core plugs were re-saturated with crude oil in the laboratory, and the experiments were performed at reservoir pressure and temperature using a novel design that replicates gas injection through a hydraulic fracture as closely as possible. CT-scanning was used to visualize the compositional changes with time and space during gas injection. The overall difference in composition between the oil injected and the oil recovered was obtained using gas chromatography. As gas surrounds the oil saturated sample, a peripheral, slow-kinetics vaporizing gas drive is the main production mechanism. Gas injection is performed using a core-holder configuration designed specifically to mimic injection into proppant filled hydraulic fractures, due to lack of injectivity directly into the shale rich matrix. Gas flows preferentially through the proppant due to its high permeability, avoiding the formation and the displacement of a miscible front along the rock matrix to mobilize the oil. Instead, the gas surrounding the reservoir core sample vaporizes the light and intermediate components from the crude oil, making recovery a function of the fraction of oil that can be vaporized into the volume of gas in the fracture at the prevailing thermodynamic conditions. The mass transfer between the injected gas and the crude oil is sufficiently fast to result in significant oil production during the first 24 hours, but slow enough to cause the formation of a compositional gradient within the matrix that exists even six days after injection has started. The peripheral production and the slow kinetic aspects of the recovery mechanism, are a consequence of the low fluid transport capacity associated with the organic rich shale that is saturated with liquid hydrocarbons. The combination of different injection gases and reservoir rocks in our experiments enabled us to effectively isolate the effects of transport properties and phase behavior. In this work, the operational guidelines regarding injection pressure and soak time derived directly from experimental observations are explained in the light of the new production mechanisms using ternary diagrams, thus providing the necessary understanding to successfully conduct gas injection in organic rich, liquid saturated shale reservoirs. Given the vast volume of crude oil trapped in shale reservoirs, this is an important step towards understanding gas injection in Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs (ULR). "

The effects of gravity stable and unstable CO2 fronts under immiscible, near miscible and miscible displacements of crude oil by CO2 are presented. We contrast our results in porous media, with slim tube experiments, core floods, and bead packed tubes. Standard slim-tube, vertically and horizontally oriented bead packed tubes, as well as vertical and horizontal reservoir core flood experiments, were used to investigate the role of the gravitational forces in improving oil recovery under different conditions regarding the crude oil – CO2 miscibility. Three crude oils with different minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) values were used in this study. Our results show the gravity drainage mechanism has a much greater significance than previously thought when compared to the effects of phase behavior or the miscibility alone. Not surprisingly, vertically stable, downward displacement resulted in better performance compared to horizontal displacement in all cores and bead packed tubes in our experiments. Recovery is only slightly higher in the gravity stable floods when miscibility is achieved. However, in immiscible and near miscible displacements, recovery is significantly higher in the gravity stable floods, reaching up to 90% RF at 250 psi below the MMP value, compared to only 33% in horizontal floods. Our results suggest that achieving miscibility is not necessary to obtain high recovery efficiency during a gravity-stable displacement. Breakthrough is reached faster in horizontal floods as a consequence of fingering and gravity override. This work challenges the paradigm that miscibility is required to achieve high recovery factors during CO2 flooding, and highlights the overlooked role of gravity drainage as a displacement mechanism. This finding has an essential impact on field operations as it allows for lower operating pressures in CO2 flooding processes under stable gravity displacement that will result in positive impact on economics. The relevance of our results is exacerbated by the current low crude oil price environment. "

                    "abstract": "Field experience along with laboratory evidence of spontaneous imbibition via the addition of surfactants into the completion fluid is widely believed to improve the IP and ultimate oil recovery from unconventional liquid reservoirs (ULR). During fracture treatment with surface active additives, surfactant molecules interact with the rock surface to enhance oil recovery through wettability alteration combined with interfacial tension (IFT) reduction. The change in capillary force as the wettability is altered by the surfactant leads to oil being expelled as water imbibes into the pore space. Several laboratory studies have been conducted to observe the effectiveness of surfactants on various shale plays during the spontaneous imbibition process, but there is an insufficient understanding of the physical mechanisms that allow scaling the lab results to field dimensions. In this manuscript, we review and evaluate dimensionless, analytical scaling groups to correlate laboratory spontaneous imbibition data in order to predict oil recovery at the field scale in ULR. In addition, capillary pressure curves are generated from imbibition rate theory originally developed by Mattax and Kyte (1962).The original scaling analysis was intended for understanding the rate of matrix-fracture transfer for a rising water level in a fracture-matrix system with variable matrix block sizes. Although contact angle and interfacial tension (IFT) are natural terms in scaling theory, virtually no work has been performed investigating these two properties. To that end, we present scaling analysis combined with numerical simulation to derive relative permeability curves, which will be imported into a discrete fracture network (DFN) model. We can then compare analytical scaling methods with conventional dual porosity concepts and then progressed to more sophisticated Discrete Fracture Network concepts. The ultimate goal is to develop more accurate predictive methods of the field-scale impact due to the addition of surfactants in the completion fluid. Correlated experimental workflows were developed to achieve the aforementioned objectives including contact angle (CA) and IFT at reservoir temperature. In addition, oil recovery of spontaneous imbibition experiments was recorded with time to evaluate the performance of different surfactants. Capillary pressure-based scaling is developed by modifying previously available scaling models based on available surfactant-related properties measured in the laboratory. To ensure representability of the scaling method; contact angle, interfacial tension, and ultimately spontaneous imbibition experiments were performed on field-retrieved samples and used as a base for developing a new scaling analysis by considering dimensionless recovery and time. Based on the capillary pressure curves obtained from the scaling model, relative permeability is approximated through a history matching procedure on core-scale numerical models. CT-Scan technology is used to build the numerical core plug model in order to preserve the heterogeneity of the unconventional core plugs and visualize the process of water imbibition in the core plugs. Time-lapse saturation changes are recorded using the CT scanner to visualize penetration of the aqueous phase into oil-saturated core samples. The capillary and relative permeability curves can then be used on DFN realizations to test cases with or without surfactant. The results of spontaneous imbibition showed that surfactant solutions had a higher oil recovery due to wettability alteration combined with IFT reduction. Our upscaling results indicate that all three methods can be used to scale laboratory results to the field. When compared to a well without surfactant additives, the optimum 3-year cumulative oil production of well that is treated with surfactant can increase by more than 20%. "

                    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of gas injection for EOR in organic rich shale. Experiments in preserved core demonstrated the potential of CO2 to extract the naturally occurring oil in organic rich shale reservoirs, whereas tests in re-saturated core plugs were used to compute accurate recovery factors, and evaluate the effect of soak time, operating pressure, and the relevance of slim-tube MMP on recovery. 18 core-flooding experiments were conducted in sidewall cores from different shale plays. The cores re-saturated with crude oil, were first cleaned by Dean-Stark extraction, and submitted to porosity and compressibility determination. The re-saturation, confirmed by CT-scanning, was attained by aging the core plugs at high pressure for two to four months. In all experiments, glass beads surrounding core samples were used to simulate the proppant and physically recreate in the laboratory a hydraulic fracture connected to the shale matrix. The slim-tube MMP was measured with CO2, and core-flooding experiments were performed below, close to, and above the MMP. The displacement equipment was coupled to a medical CT-scanner that enabled us to track the changes in composition and saturation taking place within the shale cores during the experiments. Continuous CO2 injection and huff-and-puff were evaluated using soak time from zero to 22 hours. Fixed reservoir temperature was used in all the experiments. Recovery factors ranged from 1.7 to 40%. The wide variation was the result of different experimental conditions for pressure and soak time. Both operational parameters were found to significantly affect the recovery. Increasing soak time at constant pressure consistently resulted in significant increase in recovery. The increase varied from 78 to 464% for different pressures and oil composition. Similarly, increasing operating pressure at constant soak time resulted in significant increase in recovery factor from 44 to 338% depending on soak time and oil composition. Unlike the typical response during CO2 EOR in conventional rocks, in organic rich shale, further pressure increases beyond the slim-tube MMP continued to increase the recovery factor significantly. In all runs, almost all oil recovery occurred within three days from the start of the experiment, and in all huff-and-puff tests the highest rate of recovery was observed in the first cycle, implying oil recovery with CO2 is a fast process, in comparison to oil re-saturation of the samples which occurs at a significantly slower rate. This investigation demonstrates CO2 EOR is a technically feasible method to extract significant amounts of crude oil from organic rich shale reservoirs and it provides operational understanding of how to manage pressure and soak time to maximize recovery. The recovery factors obtained in this investigation, in the context of the vast reserves of crude oil contained in organic rich shale, can sustain a second shale revolution and further capitalize oilfield infrastructure.

This study evaluates the potential of silica NPs to enhance the foam stability of three nonionic surfactants. Results showed that the concentration of surfactant and NPs is a crucial parameter for foam stability and that there is certain concentrations for strong foam generation. A balance in concentration between the nonionic surfactants and the NPs can enhance the foam stability as a result of forming flocs in solutions. At fixed surfactant concentration, the addition of NPs at low to intermediate concentrations can produce a more stable foam compared to the surfactant. The production of small population of flocs as a result of mixing the surfactant and NPs can enhance the foam stability by providing a barrier between the gas bubbles and delaying the coalescence of bubbles. Moreover, these flocs can increase the solution viscosity and, therefore, slow the drainage rate of thin aqueous film (lamellae). The measurements of foam half-life, bubble size, and mobility tests confirmed this conclusion. However, the addition of more solid particles or surfactant might have a negative impact on foam stability and reduce the maximum capillary pressure of coalescence as a result of forming extensive aggregates.

                    "abstract": "Unconventional shale reservoirs require massive and multistage hydraulically fractured horizontal wells to produce economically. Induced hydraulic fractures interacting with in-situ natural fractures result in complex or discrete fracture networks (DFNs). Even though well-testing characteristics in fractured reservoirs with vertical wells have been investigated extensively, there is a lack of good understanding of well-testing response for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in complex fracture networks. First, three practical approaches are presented regarding how to generate complex fracture networks in the context of developing unconventional shale reservoirs with hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. Complex fracture networks can be generated (1) from stochastic algorithms that enter fracture density, length, and strike distributions, or (2) from the flowing-producing DFN (FPDFN) area that is constrained by microseismic information, or (3) from digitization of realistic outcrop maps. Then, new unstructured fracture gridding and discretization techniques specially tailored for complex fracture networks are developed to handle nonuniform fracture aperture, extensive fracture clustering, and nonorthogonal fracture intersections. Finally, the numerical simulation of pressure buildup is performed in complex fracture networks that are generated from three proposed approaches with both synthetic and field examples. Flow regimes are identified and are discussed on the basis of pressure-derivative plots. Complex fracture networks show that the most representative characteristics are formation/fracture bilinear flow and formation linear-flow regimes. The appearance of the bilinear-flow regime during early period might not be clear because of the impact of the wellbore-storage effect as both the wellbore volume and the volume of the larger natural fractures in communication with the wellbore. In addition, the microseismic-based approach reduces the uncertainties of fracture characterization with percentiles of FP-DFN areas. The pressure-buildup response observed clearly indicates that the higher the percentiles of FP-DFN areas (or intense naturally fractured portion of the completion), the lower the pressure difference and derivative curves. Fracture mineralization affects pressure-buildup responses significantly. The decrease in nonuniform fracture apertures causes pressure-diagnostic plots to shift upward. The effect of boundary in the outcrop-based complex fracture network shows an early deviation from the formation linear-flow regime. No classic dual-porosity behavior is observed in all cases to quantify related parameters. Three practical techniques are proposed to generate complex fracture networks. Pressure-transient characteristics are identified and summarized. Further research areas are discussed and highlighted. The combination of techniques such as microseismic, horizontal core, production logging or some method to characterize the fracture network can be used to close the loop between the inferred network and the response that it should exhibit during pressure-transient analysis.

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing (HF) is a very complex engineering process. It involves rock and fluid mechanics, mixed mode rock failure and transportation of individual proppant particles. This process is multiscale both in time and spatial domains that is why it is almost impossible to create a fully coupled 3D model with a detailed description of physical and chemical processes even with significant assumptions. Recent data indicates well completion becomes more expensive than the drilling itself for several unconventional reservoirs. The reason is an increase of fluid and proppant pumped at high rates. Thus, the critical importance of engineering optimization of fracture spacing and individual pumping schedule for maximization of Net Present Value (NPV), Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR), and other metrics in the \"lower for longer\" price environment. Unfortunately, unconventional operators see little value in fracture modeling because of its complexity and amount of data required for any reasonable predictive power. That is why many companies consider geometric design as the cheapest and hence the most efficient option thus resulting in trial and error to optimize HF design. In this paper we use publicly available well logs and completion data covering the Midland Basin from the University Lands website. We also demonstrate that HF model calibration with microseismic data and stochastically generated Discrete Fracture Network (DFN), although is a challenging task, may improve our understanding of fracture design pitfalls and to become an essential step for optimum engineering design. Insights from our work can be useful to increase the predictive power of in-house models and reduce total cost and effort involved in this complex modeling. "

                    "abstract": "Microseismicity is a physical phenomenon which allows us to estimate the production capability of the well after hydraulic fracturing (HF) in a naturally fractured (NF) reservoir. Some of the microseismic events are reactivations of NFs induced by a direct hit of HF, while others are induced by the fluid leak-off from the previous stages or by elastic waves emitted into the reservoir with hydraulic fracture plane propagation. The former NFs have a chance to be propped there as the latter will not significantly increase their contribution to the production. Identification of such microseismic events helps to reduce uncertainty in the description of fracture network geometry. Based on inferred data from core analysis NF densities and orientations, we generated multiple realizations of the semi-stochastic Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). In order to constrain them, we used time evolution of microseismic cloud in addition to results of core analysis. Fluid and proppant pumping schedule is used to identify such microseismic events because they should be located close to the pressure diffusion front generated by hydraulic fluid. Events outside of proposed region may be triggered by other factors, such as stress-strain relaxation from other stages and correspondent fractures. In most cases, they are not wide enough to take proppant from the main HF. This approach was used to reduce range of production for DFN realizations. This workflow is implanted to a 15-stage hydraulic fracture treatment on a horizontal well placed in a siltstone reservoir with intrinsic fractures. The spatio-temporal dynamics of microseismic events are classified into two groups by the front of nonlinear pressure diffusion caused by 3-dimensional hydraulic fracturing, considered as effective and ineffective events. DFNs with only effective microseismicity and with all the induced events are generated. Then, two types of DFN related uncertainties on production are performed to evaluate the impact of filtration. Results of aleatory uncertainty quantification caused by the randomness of DFN modeling indicate the filtered events can generate a production DFN with a more consistent connected fracture area. Moreover, sensitivity analysis caused by lack of accuracy in natural fracture characterization shows the production area of DFN with filtration process is more insensitive to the variation of fracture parameters. Finally, a history match with production data and pressure data indicates this DFN model properly represents the reservoir and completion. Our methodology characterizes well the conductive fracture network utilizing core data, microseismic data, and pumping schedule. It could restore the true productivity of each fractured stage from a massive microseismic cloud, which helps understand the contribution of fracturing job right after the treatment. "

                    "abstract": "Improving oil recovery from unconventional liquid reservoirs (ULR) is a major challenge and knowledge of recovery mechanisms and interaction of completion fluid additives with the rock is fundamental in tackling the problem. Fracture treatment performance and consequent oil recovery can be improved by adding surfactants to stimulation fluids to promote imbibition by wettability alteration and interfacial tension (IFT) moderate reduction. Also, the extent of surfactant adsorption on the ULR surface during imbibition of completion fluids is an important factor to take into account when designing frac jobs. The experimental work and modeling presented in this paper focuses on analyzing alteration of wetting behavior of Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford reservoir rock with the introduction of surfactants additives. We focus on effectiveness of surfactant additives for improving oil recovery as well as the extent of surfactant loss by adsorption during imbibition of surfactant-laden completion fluid. Altering the wettability with the use of surfactant additives is accompanied by alteration of the IFT as well as surfactant adsorption. We carefully evaluate these interactive variables as key constituents of imbibition capillary pressure to improve oil recovery. We assume this is a free imbibition process with no confining pressure on the rock sample. During imbibition spontaneous imbibition, as the sign of the capillary pressure changes from negative (oil wet) to positive (water wet). Original rock wettability is determined by contact angle (CA) at reservoir temperature. Then, different types of surfactants, anionic, anionic-nonionic, and cationic, at concentrations utilized in the field, are evaluated to gauge their effectiveness in altering wettability and IFT. Wettability is also studied by zeta potential to address water film stability on the shale rock surface as an indication of wetting fluid affinity and to determine the surfactant electrostatic charges. Moreover, surfactant adsorption measurements are performed using an ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy. Calibration curves for surfactants are determined by relating their concentration to light absorbance and used to calculate the amount of surfactant adsorption into the shale rock. Next, potential for improving oil recovery via surfactant additives in ultralow permeability Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford shale core is investigated by spontaneous imbibition experiments at reservoir temperatures. In order to visualize the movement of fluid as it penetrates into liquid rich shale samples, we use computed tomography (CT) methods to determine fluid imbibition in real time. In addition, oil recovery is recorded with time to compare the performance of surfactants and water alone. Finally, laboratory data are used in numerical simulation to model laboratory results and upscale these findings to the field. The results showed that aqueous solutions with surfactants altered rock wettability from oil-wet and intermediate-wet to water-wet and reduced IFT to moderately low values. In addition, cationic surfactant presented the highest adsorption capacity following a Langmuir type adsorption profile. Spontaneous imbibition results showed that aqueous solutions with surfactants had higher imbibition and were better at recovering oil from shale core compared to water without surfactants, which agrees qualitatively with wettability and IFT alteration. However, rock lithology and surfactant type play an important role in adsorption capacity and oil recovery. Our upscaling result shows that compared to a well that is not treated with surfactant, a 24% increase on the initial peak oil rate as well as a 8% increase on the 3-year cumulative oil production are observed. For the results obtained, we can conclude that the addition of surfactants to completion fluids can improve oil recovery by wettability alteration and IFT reduction, maximizing well performance after stimulation from Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford unconventional reservoirs.

We have demonstrated in previous laboratory studies the impact of surfactants on spontaneous imbibition and oil recovery by means of wettability alteration and interfacial tension (IFT) reduction. Thereby, fracture treatment performance and consequently oil recovery could be improved by adding surfactants to stimulation fluids when a soaking-flowback production schedule is applied. This study evaluates the ability of different groups of surfactants to improve oil recovery in ULR by experimentally simulating the fracture-treatment to represent surfactant imbibition in an ULR core-fracture during a soaking-flowback. Also, we analyze the effect of wettability and IFT alteration on the process. A core-flooding system was combined with the computer tomography (CT) scanner to dynamically visualize the fluid movement as it penetrates the ULR sample in real-time as well as compare oil recovery between surfactants and water without additive. Wolfcamp sidewall cores were longitudinally fractured and loaded into an aluminum-carbon composite core-holder. Two different types of surfactants, anionic and nonionic-cationic, as well as water without surfactants, were injected through the fractures, at reservoir conditions, to evaluate their effectiveness in penetrating into the fractures and recovering oil from ULR core. Then, a soaking-flowback production scheme was used to simulate fracture-treatment and flowback. Changes in core wettability and IFT were determined by contact-angle and pendant-drop methods. Core-flooding results showed that surfactant solutions had higher imbibition and recovered more oil from liquid-rich core compared to water alone. The soaking-flowback production schedule aided by surfactants was able to recover up to 14% of the original oil in place (OOIP) whereas water alone recovered up to 2% of the OOIP. These observations qualitatively agree with wettability and IFT alteration measurements. Core wettability shifted from an original oil-wet to a final water-wet state and surfactants reduced IFT to moderately low values. The results showed that the addition of surfactants to completion fluids and the use of a soaking-flowback production scheme could improve oil recovery by wettability alteration and IFT reduction, maximizing well performance after stimulation. These findings give important understanding for designing completion fluid treatments and flowback schedules for ULR. "

                    "abstract": "Injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) into oil reservoirs has the potential to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and mitigate climate change by storing CO2 underground. Despite successes in using CO2 to enhance oil recovery, mobility control remains a major challenge facing CO2 injection projects. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of using surfactant and a mixture of surfactant and nanoparticles (NPs) to generate foam to reduce gas mobility and enhanced oil recovery. A newly developed anionic surfactant and a mixture of the surfactant and surface modified silica NPs were used to assess the ability of generating a stable foam at harsh reservoir conditions: sc-CO2 and high temperature. Dynamic foam tests and coreflood experiments were conducted to evaluate foam stability and strength. To measure the mobility of injected fluids in sandstone rocks, the foam was generated by co-injection of sc-CO2 and surfactant, as well as a mixture of surfactant and NPs at 90% quality. The coreflood experiments were conducted using non-fractured and fractured sandstone cores at 1550 psi and 50°C. Surfactant alone and mixtures of surfactant and NPs were able to generate foam in porous media and reduce CO2 mobility. The mobility reduction factor (MRF) for both cases was about 3.5 times higher than that of injecting CO2 and brine at the same conditions. The coreflood experiments in non-fractured sandstone rocks showed that both surfactant and a mixture of surfactant and NPs were able to enhance oil recovery. The baseline experiment in the absence of surfactant resulted in a total recovery of 71.50% of the original oil in place (OOIP). Using surfactant brought the oil recovery to 76% of the OOIP. The addition of NPs to surfactant resulted in a higher oil recovery still, 80% of the OOIP. In fractured rocks, oil recoveries during secondary production mechanisms for the mixture, the surfactant alone, and sc-CO2 alone were 12.62, 8.41 and 7.21% of the OOIP, respectively. "

                    "abstract": "Carbon Dioxide (CO2) flooding is one of the most globally used EOR processes to enhance the oil recovery. However, the low gas viscosity and density result in gas channeling and gravity override which lead to poor sweep efficiency. Foam application for mobility control is a promising technology to increase the gas viscosity which leads to lower mobility and better sweep efficiency inside the reservoir. Foam is generated inside the reservoir by co-injection surfactant and gas. Although there are many surfactants that can be used for such purpose, their performance with Supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) is weak which leads to poor or loss of mobility control. This experimental study evaluates a newly developed surfactant (CNF) that was introduced for ScCO2mobility control in comparison with a common foaming agent, anionic Alpha Olefin Sulfonate (AOS) surfactant. Experimental work was divided into three stages: foam static tests, interfacial tension measurements, and foam dynamic tests. Both surfactants were investigated at different conditions. In general, results showed that both surfactants are good foaming agents to reduce the mobility of ScCO2 with better performance of CNF surfactant. Shaking tests in presence of crude oil showed that foam life for CNF extends to more than 24-hr but less than that for AOS. Moreover, CNF features lower CMC, higher adsorption and smaller area/molecule at the liquid-air interface. Furthermore, entering, spreading, and bridging coefficients interpretations indicated that CNF surfactant produces very stable foam with light crude oil in both DI and saline water, whereas AOS was stable only in DI water. At all conditions for mobility reduction evaluation, CNF exhibited stronger flow resistance, higher foam viscosity, and higher mobility reduction factor than that of AOS surfactant. In addition, CNF and ScCO2 simultaneous injection produced 8.83% higher oil recovery than that of the baseline experiment and 7.87% higher than that of AOS. Pressure drop profiles for foam flooding using CNF was slightly higher than that of AOS indicating that CNF is better in terms of foam-oil tolerance which resulted in higher oil recovery. "

Due to the rapid decline rate after primary depletion of fractured reservoirs, extracting the remaining liquid hydrocarbon from the nano-Darcy permeability matrix becomes the next step. Previously conducted laboratory experiments demonstrated promising results by successfully recovering liquid hydrocarbon from preserved and unfractured sidewall unconventional core plugs. However, what are the driving forces behind this observed result was not well understood. In other words, is the hydrocarbon recovery associated with commonly known recovery mechanisms during CO2 EOR processes, such as viscous displacement, oil volume expansion, viscosity reduction and vaporization of lighter hydrocarbon components? Or, is it driven by other mechanisms that are frequently considered insignificant during conventional CO2 EOR processes? This study utilizes a commercial compositional simulator to investigate the oil production mechanisms from the matrix into the fractures. The process includes constructing a fine grid 3D model to simulate the previously conducted laboratory experiment, performing systematic sensitivity analysis, and evaluating the mechanisms that could potentially contribute to the oil recovery observed during the experiments. With laboratory scale modeling, the dominating mass transfer mechanism between the matrix and fractures, which in turn translates into oil recovery mechanism, is concluded to be diffusion. The work provided in this study can be used to enhance the accuracy for upscaled field simulations. However, whether CO2 EOR will unlock the unconventional liquid reservoir potential and make significant economic impacts at field scale needs to be carefully evaluated on a case by case basis.

However, ULR lithology plays a major role in surfactant selection due to rock-fluid interactions having direct impact on oil recovery. This experimental study evaluates and compares the efficiency of different groups and blends of surfactants on recovering liquid hydrocarbons from siliceous and carbonate Wolfcamp shale cores by analyzing the effects of lithology, oil and surfactant type on wettability and IFT alteration, and their impact on imbibition and oil recovery. ULR wettability was determined by contact angle (CA) experiments, and its alteration was evidenced when adding surfactants to completion fluids. The results showed that at field-used concentrations, all tested surfactants altered wettability from oil and intermediate-wet to water-wet. These findings were consistent with zeta potential results when assessing surfactant solution film stability on siliceous and carbonate shale rock surfaces as an indication of water wetness. In addition, IFT between crude oil and completion fluids was measured to gauge IFT reduction by surfactants, showing higher reductions by anionic surfactants compared to nonionic and blended surfactants. Finally, imbibition potential for completion fluids with and without surfactants was tested in spontaneous imbibition experiments. Oil recovery from Wolfcamp shale cores was tracked in real time, and CT scan technology was simultaneously used to monitor frac fluid penetration in ULR cores. The results showed that cores submerged in completion fluids with surfactant additives have higher hydrocarbon recovery and better fluid imbibition than those in frac fluids without surfactants. In addition, siliceous shale cores had higher oil recovery and fluid penetration when anionic surfactants were used. Conversely, carbonate shale cores showed better hydrocarbon recovery and penetration when submerged in nonionic-cationic surfactants. Hence, it can be concluded that the addition of surfactants to completion fluids improved oil recovery by wettability alteration and IFT reduction, and core lithology, oil and surfactant type impacted fluid imbibition and oil recovery and should play a major role on surfactant selection. These findings give important understanding for designing completion fluid treatments and flowback schedules for these ULR. "

                    "abstract": "This work presents the carbon dioxide (CO2) storage capacity of the Wolfcamp formation in West Texas. The potential of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery from unconventional liquid reservoirs have been under investigation in recent years. Quantifying the rock ability to store CO2 is necessary for the economic assessment of CO2 EOR, and for the evaluation of carbon sequestration capacity. We measured the porosity, the rock compressibility and the CO2 sorption in sidewall core plugs taken from two wells drilled in the Wolfcamp shale. Computed tomography scanning technology was used to image the samples and investigate the relation between rock density and porosity, and rock density and CO2 sorption. A gas expansion pycnometer was used for the experiments. To accommodate the challenges associated with extremely tight rocks the equipment was provided with accurate temperature control, and a high resolution gauge with the capability of recording pressure as a function of time. Porosity and compressibility were measured simultaneously using helium. We used different treatments for the rock compressibility and explored its behavior at low pressure. A Langmuir isotherm was used to account for sorption of CO2 on the organic matter of the shale. The volume available for free gas was corrected by incorporating the rock compressibility and the volume of the layer of sorbed CO2 in the analysis of the sorption data. This study adds to the understanding of the storage capacity of the Wolfcamp shale. We found the porosity to be between 5.94 and 10.30%, the Langmuir volume between 38.77 and 154.51 scf/ton, and the Langmuir pressure from 512.59 to 1384.52 psig. Using CT number as a proxy for total organic content, we observed a linear relation between CT number and sorption capacity. Porosity also showed a linear relation with CT number. Free CO2 storage is the main storage mechanism, at pressures above 2500 psig (for all samples) accounting for more than 80 %. Sorption is a relevant storage mechanism at low reservoir pressure. Neglecting the rock compressibility or the volume of the sorbed layer can lead to wrong estimates of sorption capacity. The techniques developed in this work provide for an economic and accurate mean of measuring porosity, compressibility, and sorption in tight unconventional core plugs. The use of a non-destructive approach is necessary to characterize core plugs that must remain intact for further testing such as the evaluation of enhanced recovery techniques in unconventional reservoirs. This research provides relevant data for the economic assessment of CO2 EOR in the Wolfcamp and the potential for carbon sequestration. The linear relations we observed for both, porosity and sorption capacity, with CT numbers, are of extreme interest as they can be exploited for faster petrophysical evaluation of unconventional tight rocks.

                    "abstract": "Wettability alteration in unconventional liquid reservoirs (ULRs) can improve fracture-treatment performance and consequently oil recovery by changing capillary forces when shifting intermediate and oil-wet reservoirs to water-wet. Wettability can be modified while fracturing the formation by adding surfactants, in proper concentrations, to completion fluids favoring the process of imbibition and increasing current ULR recovery factors of less than 10% of the original oil in place (OOIP). This study combines the effect of wettability and interfacial-tension (IFT) alteration by surfactants and the corresponding effect on spontaneous imbibition in ULRs from the Permian Basin through a correlated experimental work flow, which includes conducting contact-angle (CA) and ζ-potential experiments, IFT measurements, and spontaneous-imbibition experiments combined with computed-tomography (CT) methods to evaluate and compare the efficiency of different surfactants in altering wettability and recovering hydrocarbons from siliceous core at reservoir temperature. Wettability-experiment results showed that all surfactants change ULR core-wetting affinity from oil- and intermediate-wet to water-wet at commonly field-used concentrations. However, the anionic surfactant showed better results in changing CAs. In addition, the anionic surfactant better reduced the IFT than nonionic and mixed surfactants, and surfactants performed better than fracturing fluid without surfactant additives. Finally, spontaneous-imbibition results showed that the anionic surfactant was better for recovering oil from shale core, which agrees qualitatively with the previous results where the anionic surfactant showed the lowest CAs and IFT. However, both anionic and nonionic surfactants were better in displacing liquid hydrocarbons and had higher penetration magnitudes obtained by CT methods compared with fracturing water without surfactant. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the addition of proper surfactants to fracturing fluids has the potential of improving oil recovery by wettability and IFT alteration, with the anionic surfactant showing lower CAs and IFT, better imbibition, and higher oil recovery than nonionic and mixed surfactants in these siliceous ULRs from the Permian Basin.

                    "abstract": "In the context of modeling fractured horizontal wells, unstructured grids have been applied to generate simulation meshes for complex fracture networks. It is necessary to investigate how to choose an unstructured mesh to accurately simulate production performance. In this paper, a new unstructured gridding and discretization work flow is proposed to handle nonorthogonal and low-angle intersections of extensively clustered fractures with nonuniform apertures. The work flow is then validated with two models in terms of production behavior and central-processing-unit (CPU) performance: a synthetic model with one horizontal well and orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures built by tartan grid, and a field-scale local-grid-refinement (LGR) model with three horizontal wells and irregular hydraulic fractures in a slightly dipping reservoir created by a commercial software plug-in. Good-quality matches are obtained between unstructured and structured grids in both pressure and production behavior. Sensitivity analysis of the meshing parameters suggests that refinement in the vicinity of fractures has improved both early and late production of a well, whereas background density has a dominant effect on the late production. Background-grid type and orientation have less influence as long as they have the same grid density. Fewer cells can be achieved by increasing reservoir-background size and size-progression ratio, replacing unstructured-background grids with structured grids, and reducing the complexity of the fracture networks without loss of the accuracy, resulting in improved CPU performance. This study applies unstructured grids to simulate multiple horizontal wells with complicated fracture networks, and provides detailed comparisons between unstructured and structured grids. Most importantly, it resolves the question regarding how to choose an appropriate mesh to yield both accurate results and high-quality CPU performance. "

Altering wettability in unconventional liquid resources as an improved oil recovery method can be reached by adding surfactants to fracturing fluids.

                    "abstract": "Nonuniform fracture aperture not only might affect initial reservoir fluids in place, but also production behavior. Previous experimental work has already demonstrated the importance of nonuniform fracture aperture on permeability and residual oil distributions. This study investigates its impact on unconventional liquid reservoirs through outcrop analysis of Eagleford maps, unstructured gridding, and reservoir simulation of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. Previously documented Eagleford outcrop maps are digitized as fracture patterns. Fracture networks for reservoir simulation are generated by duplicating the fracture patterns along horizontal and vertical directions. Then, in order to evaluate production performance of the complex fracture networks, unstructured gridding algorithms are developed to discretize the fractured reservoir domain. Furthermore, previously CT-measured lognormal fracture apertures are populated along each fracture. Finally, the impact of nonuniform fracture apertures on production performance is evaluated under different closure stresses and compared with corresponding uniform fracture apertures. The complex fracture networks generated from outcrop maps show very high natural fracture density than what we usually observe in the literature about Eagle Ford formation. Fractures with nonuniform apertures show responses of finite fracture conductivity. In the early period, fracture drainage is observed around the horizontal well, even if fractures in outcrop maps are very well connected. At the later period, matrix-fracture transient flow dominates the production, showing a long tail in production rate plots. In addition, stress-dependent nonuniform fracture apertures affect cumulative oil production. The higher the closure stresses, the higher the chance the aperture decreases, and thus the lower the production performance. Moreover, when fracture mineralization is taken into account, the decrease of nonuniform apertures can bring down the cumulative oil production by almost half. Furthermore, the cumulative oil profile of nonuniform apertures is bounded by those of arithmetic and harmonic averaged apertures. Therefore, it is possible to quickly estimate well production using uniform fracture apertures that are obtained by applying averaging techniques to nonuniform apertures. This paper proposed a workflow to simulate well production performance of Eagle Ford outcrop maps with nonuniform fracture apertures. Besides, the impact of nonuniform fracture apertures due to closure stresses and mineralization is presented together with comparisons with uniform fracture apertures. "

                    "title": "Numerical Simulation of Stochastically-Generated Complex Fracture Networks by Utilizing Core and Microseismic Data for Hydraulically Fractured Horizontal Wells in Unconventional Reservoirs– A Field Case Study",
                    "abstract": "Unconventional reservoirs require hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in order to produce reservoir fluids economically. Induced hydraulic fractures interacting with pre-existing natural fractures results in complex fracture networks (CFNs). Even though hydraulic fracture propagation has been investigated extensively, there is indeed a lack of good understanding of characterization approaches for pre-existing natural fractures. This work presents a practical CFN generation approach by incorporating stochastic algorithms, core, and microseismic data. Based on analysis of geological structures and core observation, natural fracture density, length, and strike distributions can be obtained. Fracture length follows a power law distribution constrained by minimum, maximum and cutoff lengths as well as a distribution exponent. Fracture strike follows a Fisher distribution. Then, microseismic event locations are used to constrain fracture centers of stochastically generated natural fractures. Moreover, a fast proxy model is developed for hydraulic fracture propagation, which honors both the total mass volume of the pumped proppants, and the pre-defined reference lengths. Finally, a field case study is used to demonstrate how to apply the proposed fracture generation and simulation workflow to model hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. The proposed workflow implemented stochastic algorithms with the capabilities to incorporate as much information as possible such as core analysis and microseismic information, and to evaluate uncertainties due to pre-existing natural fractures. With the assumption that microseismic event locations are reactivation of pre-existing natural fractures, the perturbed event locations constrained the locations of the natural fracture centers, resulting in a better description of microseismic-derived stimulated reservoir volume. The simplified hydraulic fracture propagation scheme was able to efficiently estimate the resulting complex fracture networks, and to accurately honor the material balance during fracturing treatment. Sensitivity analysis showed that fracture permeability, matrix porosity, and matrix permeability of the CFNs affect well production performance, significantly. This paper discusses how to utilize available data resources to generate representative CFNs for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. The process of data preparation for each step of the workflow is discussed in details to facilitate engineers to solve practical problems with the developed methodology. "

                    "abstract": "Unconventional shale reservoirs require massive and multistage hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in order to produce economically. Induced hydraulic fractures interacting with in-situ natural fractures results in complex or discrete fracture networks (DFN). Even though well testing characteristics in fractured reservoirs with vertical wells have been investigated extensively, there is indeed a lack of good understanding of well testing behaviors for hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in complex fracture networks. First, three practical approaches are presented regarding how to generate complex fracture networks in the context of developing unconventional shale reservoirs with hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. Complex fracture networks can be generated 1) from stochastic algorithms that input fracture density, length and strike distributions, or 2) from the flowing-producing DFN (FP-DFN) area that is constrained by microseismic information, or 3) from digitization of realistic outcrop maps. Then, new unstructured fracture gridding and discretization techniques specially tailored for complex fracture networks are developed to handle nonuniform fracture apertures, extensively fracture clustering and nonorthogonal fracture intersections. Finally, numerical simulations of pressure build-up are performed in complex fracture networks that are generated from three proposed approaches using both synthetic and field examples. Flow regimes are identified and discussed based on pressure derivative plots. Complex fracture networks show that the most representative characteristics are formation-fracture bilinear flow and formation linear flow regimes. The appearance of the bilinear flow regime during early period might be not clear due to the impact of wellbore storage effect for the fractal fracture generation approach. In addition, the microseismic-based approach reduces uncertainties of fracture characterization by using percentiles of FP-DFN areas. The pressure build-up responses clearly indicate that the higher the percentiles of FP-DFN areas, the lower the pressure difference and derivative curves. The fracture mineralization affects pressure build-up responses significantly. The decrease in nonuniform fracture apertures cause pressure diagnostic plots shift upward. The effect of boundary in the outcrop-based complex fracture network shows an early deviation from the formation linear flow regime. No classic dual porosity behavior is observed in all cases to quantify related parameters. Three practical techniques are proposed to generate complex fracture networks. Pressure transient characteristics are identified and summarized. The open research areas are discussed and highlighted. This work helps us better understand pressure transient behavior of complex fracture networks and after-closure analysis of fracturing calibration test. "

In addition, previous lab experiment has already demonstrated the importance of nonuniform aperture on permeability and residual oil distribution. This study investigates the impact of aperture averaging techniques on production performance of complex fracture networks in unconventional liquid reservoirs through fracture generation, unstructured gridding and reservoir simulation of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. First, complex fracture networks are generated from microseismic-constrained stochastic algorithms. We reduce uncertainties of natural fracture length, center, and strike distributions by incorporating outcrop analysis and microseismic event locations. Hydraulic fractures are generated by randomly connecting natural fractures and by honoring material balance equations. Then, stress-dependent nonuniform fracture aperture distributions were taken from previously CT-scanning experiment. Moreover, in order to evaluate production performance, nonuniform apertures are sampled from the lab-measured lognormal distributions and then populated along complex fracture networks. Nonuniform aperture is explicitly gridded up and discretized using unstructured grids for reservoir simulations. Finally, numerous aperture-averaging techniques are investigated considering whether or not to honor input fracture conductivity distributions. Numerical simulations show that the same aperture distribution yields similar cumulative oil curves. With the increase of overburden stresses, the lab measured lognormal aperture peaks shift to the left. Correspondingly, it is observed decreased cumulative oil production. In addition, if fracture conductivity remains the same, the cubic law–based averaging approach yields the best production performance. If the fracture conductivity is not kept the same, the arithmetic averaging method provides us with the best production performance, which is followed by the base, geometric and harmonic cases. This paper demonstrated how to simulate production performance of stress-dependent nonuniform aperture in complex fracture networks. The crucial impact of nonuniform fracture aperture and averaging techniques are highlighted through comparison with the uniform fracture aperture. "

To capture this complexity, we propose a workflow that integrates a semi-stochastic Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) generator constrained by Microseismic events, core data and an efficient Perpendicular Bisector (PEBI) grid generator for the explicit discretization of the network. We applied this workflow to evaluate the effect of DFN related uncertainties on production performance.

The model also interconnects natural and hydraulic fractures through a geomechanics-based algorithm. For an efficient fracture discretization, we developed a PEBI meshing technique capable to conform to low-angle intersections of extensively clustered network, incorporating optimization algorithms that reduce highly skewed cells, and ensure good mesh quality. Finally, to evaluate the impact of DFN related uncertainties on production, we implemented an efficient Monte Carlo (MC) methodology that minimizes flow simulations. We implemented the workflow in a stage of a hydraulic fracture treatment to evaluate the impact of two type of DFN related uncertainties on production: those coming from the randomness of DFN modeling and those coming from the lack of accurate knowledge of PDF parameters. We show that the proposed DFN modeling approach can be applied to calculate the \"Fluid-Producing DFN (FP-DFN),\" which is the network area connected to the well and able to produce, to minimize flow simulations for the MC runs. After performing efficient-based MC simulations with our DFN model, we were able to generate the FP-DFN Cumulative Density Function (CDF) incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties. From this CDF, different percentiles were selected with the respective DFN realizations for fluid simulations. We show that the developed PEBI meshing algorithm is capable to grid efficiently these complex DFN geometries with good mesh quality. Finally, 20-year production simulations suggest that a difference of several MSTB between the lowest and highest percentiles may exist revealing the effect of the DFN related uncertainties on production. Our integrated workflow provides a methodology to efficiently model and mesh explicitly complex DFN systems for numerical fluid simulations, incorporating microseismic and core data.

                    "abstract": "This work is a novel attempt to analyze rock/brine and oil/brine interactions in heterogeneous unconventional liquid reservoir rocks and the effect of these interactions on oil recovery. There is very limited literature on the impact of brine salinity on shale wettability alteration and spontaneous imbibition experiments. This study includes a comprehensive approach that analyzes rock-fluid interactions through contact angle and zeta potential measurements followed by imbibition studies monitored by CT scan technology to understand the effect of salinity on CT penetration profiles and the resultant oil recovery. The rock samples were obtained from sidewall coring of an ultra-tight liquid rich shale in South Texas composed predominantly of carbonate while sodium chloride and calcium chloride brines of varying concentrations were used as testing fluids. Contact angle and IFT experiments were conducted on unaltered samples aged in oil obtained from the same well the sidewall samples were retrieved. The captive bubble method was used to measure the contact angles of oil droplets on the rock while IFT was measured using the pendant drop technique. Zeta potentials were measured to assess the stability of thin brine films on the powdered rock samples and oil droplets. Finally, spontaneous imbibition was carried out at optimum salt concentration that resulted in maximum water wetness to measure oil recovery while Computed Tomography (CT) based imaging was used to analyze imbibition profiles and quantify penetration of fluids into the rock. Experimental results suggest that both sodium and calcium chloride were able to alter wettability of samples from an initial intermediate-wet state to water-wet with the maximum water wetness observed for sodium chloride. Increasing salt concentration also lowered the crude oil/brine IFT marginally. Zeta potential measurements suggested sodium brine films were more stable compared to calcium brines while double layer expansion does not completely explain the wetting changes observed. Sodium and calcium brines at optimum salinities recovered more oil compared to water alone while maximum recovery was obtained with sodium chloride which also penetrated the most into the rock matrix as found by analyzing the CT scan images. This study therefore validates the potential of affordable low salinity injection brines which have the capability to alter shale rock wettability and improve oil recovery by penetrating deeper into the reservoir rock.

                    "abstract": "The application of surfactants to improve oil recovery in conventional reservoirs via wettability alteration and enhancement of spontaneous imbibition has been extensively studied in the literature. However, little work has been performed yet to investigate the interaction of these surfactants with ultra-tight oil-rich shale reservoirs such as Wolfcamp shale. The use of horizontal drilling and massive multistage hydraulic fracturing has made primary oil recovery from these ultra-tight oil-rich shale reservoirs possible. With declining production from existing shale wells, it is essential to explore potential \"beyond primary\" strategies in shale oil development. This paper analyzes the potential of surfactants in altering wettability and improving the process of spontaneous imbibition in oil rich shales demonstrating nanodarcy range permeability, relevant to stimulation and \"beyond primary\" chemical EOR applications in shales. Novel proprietary surfactant blends along with traditional nonionic surfactants were investigated in this study using Wolfcamp shale core samples exhibiting nanodarcy permeability. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed which indicated that Wolfcamp shale has mixed mineralogy, with quartz, calcite, and dolomite acting as the major minerals in varying proportions depending on the interval depth. Contact angle and interfacial tension measurements were performed at reservoir temperature to identify the state of native wettability and the impact of surfactants in altering wettability. Thereafter, spontaneous imbibition experiments were performed using 3D computed tomography methods to understand the improvement in the magnitude of imbibition penetration due to surfactant addition. Contact angle and spontaneous imbibition experiments showed that Wolfcamp shale is intermediate-wet and surfactants have the potential to alter the native wettability to a preferentially water-wet state and improve oil recovery due to enhanced spontaneous imbibition. Surfactants which altered the wettability significantly, but lowered the interfacial tension only slightly showed the highest oil recoveries due to the creation of strong capillary driven forces directly responsible for effective spontaneous imbibition. The potential of surfactants in altering wettability and improving oil recovery via enhanced spontaneous imbibition in ultra-tight oil-rich shales was verified in this study. The effectiveness of traditional nonionic surfactants in altering wettability and improving oil recovery was found to be comparable to that of novel, more expensive proprietary surfactant blends, and hence, the traditional nonionic surfactants provide a cost effective option for stimulation and EOR applications in Wolfcamp shale. Overall, this paper presents the theory behind surfactant interaction with ultra-tight shales and provides experimental results to validate the viability of surfactant induced improved oil recovery in shales.

                    "abstract": "We present a technique that enables the determination of the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of a CO2 – oil system using a short 20 ft slim tube in less than two weeks, about a third of what it normally takes using the conventional 80 ft slim tube. MMP is a crucial parameter in designing a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project and its value needs to be known with a degree of accuracy that cannot be provided by the use of equations of state or correlations, and therefore, needs to be determined experimentally. The slim tube technique is recognized to be the most accurate experimental method for determining the MMP, however its use has not been favored because it is time consuming. We determined the MMP for five CO2 – crude oil systems from the North Burbank Unit and the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle. The reduction in the length of the slim tube from 80 ft to 20 ft resulted in a decrease in the total time of the experiment. The validity of our technique was proven with performing recovery factor measurements using a conventional 80 ft long slim tube. The MMP values obtained are valid when the length of the slim tube is sufficient to host the mixing zone and the velocity of the displacement is slow enough to enable the transverse dispersion to eliminate viscous fingering. In the case of light oil, the use of the 20 ft slim tube is justified as the length of the mixing zone is shorter. We support our results with the use of numerical simulation. The reduction in the time required for slim tube experiments results in a fast, economic and accurate technique for the determination of MMP in CO2 – light crude oil systems. Taking into account that CO2 flooding is the most applied EOR technique in the US and that it is mainly applied to light oil reservoirs, this work can be of great impact by providing a rapid and reliable method to determine the MMP for designing a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project.

                    "title": "Altering Wettability in Bakken Shale by Surfactant Additives and Potential of Improving Oil Recovery During Injection of Completion Fluids",
                    "abstract": "Fracture treatment performance in Bakken shale reservoirs can be improved by altering rock wettability, as measured with contact angle (CA), from oil-wet to water-wet. The use of chemical additives for altering wettability also results in alteration of the interfacial tension (IFT). The Young-Laplace equation relates the capillary pressure to IFT and contact angle. Thus, it follows that capillarity is significant in nano-pores associated with unconventional liquid reservoirs (ULR) and complex as the CA and IFT varies simultaneously. We carefully evaluate these interactive variables to improve oil recovery by alteration of capillary pressure by understanding the wetting state of siliceous and carbonate Bakken cores with and without chemical additives. We have observed that wettability can be altered from the ULR natural state of oil-wet to systems favoring frac fluid imbibition. Surfactants can be added to completion fluids, in proper concentrations, to alter wettability while hydraulic fracturing the formation. This experimental study evaluates and compares the efficiency of anionic, nonionic and blended surfactants as well as complex nanofluids (CNF) on recovering liquid hydrocarbons from Bakken shale cores by analyzing the effect of wettability and IFT alteration and their impact on spontaneous imbibition. The original wettability of Bakken cores is determined by CA measurements. Then, three surfactant types, anionic nonionic and nonionic-cationic, and CNF are evaluated to gauge their effectiveness in altering wettability. The results show that all surfactants and CNF are able to shift core wettability from oil-wet to water-wet. However, chemical additives efficacy strongly depends on rock lithology, surfactant, and CNF type. Moreover, to evaluate further wettability alteration, stability of surfactant and CNF solution films on the shale rock surface is determined by zeta potential measurements. Surfactants and CNF show higher zeta potential magnitudes than water without additives, as an indication of better stability and water-wetness, which agrees with CA results. In addition, the effect of IFT alteration is studied in solutions with surfactants and CNF, and Bakken crude oil. Higher IFT reduction is achieved by anionic surfactants, but all surfactants and CNF perform better than water alone. Surfactants and CNF potential for improving oil recovery in ultralow permeability Bakken cores is investigated by spontaneous imbibition experiments using modified Amott cells in an environmental chamber. Using computed tomography (CT) scan methods, water imbibition as penetration magnitude is measured in real time. In addition, oil recovery is recorded with time to compare the performance of surfactants, CNF, and completion fluid alone. The results suggest that surfactants and CNF are better on recovering oil from shale core displacing more oil and having higher penetration magnitudes than water without additives. In addition, oil recovery depends on surfactant and CNF type and rock mineral composition. These findings are consistent with CA, zeta potential, and IFT measurements. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that altering wettability and reducing IFT when surfactants and CNF additives are added to completion fluids can improve oil recovery in Bakken cores.

                    "abstract": "With the synergy of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, commercial production of Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs (ULR) has been successfully demonstrated. Due to the low recovery factor of these reservoirs, it is inevitable that Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) will ensue. Experimental results have shown promising oil recovery potential using CO2. This study investigates oil production mechanisms from the matrix into the fracture by simulating two laboratory experiments as well as several field-scale studies, and evaluates the potential of using CO2 huff-n-puff process to enhance the oil recovery in ULR with nano-Darcy range matrix permeability in complex natural fracture networks. This study fully explores mechanisms contributing to the oil recovery with numerical modeling of experimental work, and provides a systematic investigation of the effects of various parameters on oil recovery. The core scale modeling utilizes two methods of determining properties that are used to construct 3D heterogeneous models. The findings are then upscaled to the field scale where both simple and complex fractures in a single stage are modeled. The effects of reservoir properties and operational parameters on oil recovery are then investigated. In addition, this study is the first to present simulation results of CO2 huff-n-puff using complex fracture networks which are generated from microseismic-constraint stochastic models. Diffusion is proven to be the dominant oil recovery mechanism at the laboratory scale. However, the field-scale reservoir simulation indicates diffusion is negligible compared to the well-known mechanisms accompanying multi-contact miscibility. This includes swelling, viscosity reduction, and gas expansion in the matrix. Overall, the CO2 huff-n-puff process was found to be beneficial in both models in terms of enhancing the ultimate oil recovery in ULR. "

One of the characteristics of the ULRs is high production declining rate, and thus enhanced oil recovery techniques such as Huff-n-Puff will ensue. In addition, the existence of complex fracture network has been proven by both field and simulation work. This study investigated the potential of CO2 huff-n-puff in ULRs with complex fracture networks. Two fracture characterization techniques for complex fracture network such as fractal-based, and microseismic-based were applied to reduce uncertainties of fracture networks and thus improve the accuracy of simulation input. In order to study complex CO2 recovery mechanism, lab-measured data was upscaled to the field-scale, and then used for evaluating production performance of a simple fracture network. Detailed sensitivity analysis showed that diffusion in the field scale is negligible compared with other recovery mechanisms such as oil swelling, gas expansion, viscosity reduction, etc. The following comparison between dual continuum and the explicit fracture modeling approaches highlights the importance of heterogeneity due to the explicit fractures. Dual continuum models yields less accurate pressure behavior than explicit discrete fracture models even though production behavior could be history matched. "

                    "abstract": "Unconventional reservoirs require extensive hydraulic-fracturing treatments to produce fluids economically and efficiently. The main purpose of such treatments is to create complex fracture networks with high-conductivity paths deeper into the nonstimulated reservoir regions. Proppants play an important role in maintaining good-quality fracture conductivities, which then greatly affect long-term production performance. In addition, research on proppants has shown a reduction in conductivities under downhole stresses and multiphase-flow behaviours. Therefore, it is important to study the effect different proppants and conductivities have on production performance through actual field cases. To evaluate the production performance of wells completed with different proppants, the authors proposed an integrated work flow for characterization and simulation of unconventional reservoirs. This work flow is unique because of the stochastic fracture-network-generation algorithms and improved unstructured-grid-generation techniques. Both analysis of field-production data and numerical simulations were performed on eight wells in the CAPA field of North Dakota. For the field-data analysis, three public-data resources were reviewed to prepare a summary of reservoir properties, fracture properties, proppant properties, and production history. For the numerical simulations, all the wells were modelled and simulated with the proposed work flow. Finally, sensitivity analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of fracture conductivities and natural fractures. After completing the field-case studies and reservoir simulations, it was concluded that with the same fracture design, higher fracture conductivity improves production performance. Pumping a smaller volume of upgraded proppants with higher conductivity not only improves long-term production performance, but also justifies the additional costs and reduces the overall operation time of the entire hydraulic-fracturing job. The stimulated reservoir volume was greatly increased, as was the production performance, where natural fractures exist. In this paper, field-data analysis was applied in the Bakken to demonstrate the integrated unconventional work flow. The proposed unstructured-gridding algorithms can be incorporated into any preprocessor to handle complex networks. Reservoir, fracture, and proppant characterization and reservoir simulation of the field cases can help engineers prepare and interpret simulation input and output. "

A total of 143 ft. of 4 in. diameter reservoir core from the North Burbank Unit (NBU) in Oklahoma were imaged using a state of the art medical computed tomography scanner. The CT number, which is a function of the density and composition of the rock was observed to correlate with both porosity and permeability values that were measured discretely along the core using conventional laboratory techniques. A mathematical expression was fit to the data that allows the prediction of the porosity and the permeability of the core within the 350 µm isotropic resolution that the CT scanning unit is capable of. We also show that in the case of reservoirs with high vertical heterogeneity, where permeability variations of hundreds of millidarcies occur within one foot, the selection by visual inspection of core plugs for laboratory measurement of petrophysical properties leads to a flawed characterization of the stratigraphic column as some of the plugs are taken along bedding planes, and therefore are comprised of more than one rock type. We propose the use of CT-scan imaging to identify different rock types and take core plugs that are representative of unique rock types as a better practice for rock characterization. Our work has greatly improved the knowledge of the stratigraphic column of the NBU and has provided a better understanding of the degree of vertical heterogeneity in the area. The detailed knowledge of permeability and porosity obtained from the CT numbers of the cored well can be used for the adjustment of petrophysical models based on well logs to enable the extrapolation of the detailed petrophysical characterization of the cored well to other NBU wells that have not been cored but have log data. The implementation of the proposed technique will help optimize well completion, sand perforation, water and gas shut off treatments, and EOR schemes implementation among other activities. "

                    "abstract": "This work investigates the use of polymers during CO2 WAG using a physical model. Coreflooding experiments were conducted to compare polymer assisted WAG, conventional WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and polymer flooding. The effect of miscibility in the CO2 – oil interface was evaluated from coreflooding at two different pressures, above and below the MMP of 1563 psig The MMP was experimentally determined using a fast version of the slim tube procedure with a shorter column. The influence of reservoir heterogeneity was observed by conducting corefloodings in homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks with permeability ranging from 13 to 1300 md. The core plugs were selected using computed tomography to ensure the presence or absence of heterogeneous features. Our results show that under miscible displacement in a homogeneous rock, continuous CO2 injection can reduce residual oil saturation (Sor) to less than 10%, even for a permeability as low as 13 md. The implementation of conventional WAG and polymer assisted WAG in this case was detrimental for the process as water saturation shielded a portion of the oil preventing CO2 contact. The departure from the ideal miscible displacement resulted in a Sor as high as 32 %. For the heterogeneous rock, at 285 psig above MMP, the WAG CO2 was able to reduce Sor to as low as 11%, whereas at 260 psig below MMP a Sor of 23% was reached. As the level of heterogeneity increases, the oil recovery of polymer assisted WAG relative to conventional WAG increased suggesting that a certain degree of heterogeneity is needed for the polymer assisted WAG process to be beneficial. A throughout discussion on the recovery mechanisms and the interactive / combined role of miscibility, heterogeneity, permeability and viscosity is presented. This work adds to the understanding of the CO2 flooding process implemented in the North Burbank Unit (NBU) and the potential to use WAG and polymer assisted WAG to improve mobility control. Sweep efficiency is the most important challenge from a reservoir engineering standpoint for CO2 flooding, but it is particularly critical in the NBU for two reasons. The high vertical heterogeneity in the field, with a permeability variation of three orders of magnitude within 30 ft of reservoir thickness, which greatly exacerbates viscous fingering, and the use of anthropogenic CO2 which makes the economics of the project more sensitive.

                    "abstract": "In the context of multi-stage hydraulically fractured horizontal wells, unstructured grids such as PEBI (perpendicular bisector) grids or Voronoi grids have been widely applied to generate simulation meshes for fracture networks. In previous work we developed a robust optimization-based 2D meshing algorithms to handle non-orthogonal, low-angle intersections of extensively-clustered fractures with non-uniform aperture distributions. However, vertically extruded 2.5D PEBI grids become necessary with more wells being drilled into dipping layers. Besides, it is necessary to provide practical application suggestions for choosing an unstructured mesh to accurately resolve flow regimes of production. In this work we extended 2D PEBI workflow to 2.5D, and then validated it against two models: (a) a synthetic model with one horizontal well and 120 orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures built by Tar-tan grid and (b) a field-scale model with three horizontal wells and 120 non-orthogonal intersected hydraulic fractures in a slightly dipping reservoir created by a commercial software plug-in. For the synthetic model, we simulated production performance at a constant bottom-hole flowing pressure up to 20 years. For the field-scale model, we first performed history matching and then predicted production at a constant rate up to 20 years. We compared pressure diffusion front, bottom-hole flowing pressure as well as CPU performance. Reasonably good matches between PEBI grids and other grids are observed in both pressure diffusion front and production behavior. Sensitivity analysis suggests that refinement around the fractures has modest impact to early time production while background density has dominant impact to the late time production. Background grid type and grid orientation have less influence as long as they have the same grid density. Less number of 2.5D PEBI cells can be achieved by removing unnecessary refinement around fractures, increasing reservoir background size and reservoir background size ratio, replacing unstructured background grids with structured grids, and reducing the complexity of the fracture networks without loss of the accuracy and therefore result in much favorable CPU performance. The existence of opened natural fractures was evaluated to simulate the out-of-zone production. The results suggest that effective drainage area can be significantly greater with the synergy of the natural fractures. This study is the first to apply unstructured grids to simulate multiple horizontal wells with irregular hydraulic fractures. Besides, this paper provides detailed discussions of implementation algorithms as well as comparisons between 2.5D PEBI and LGR based grids in the context of fracture modeling. And most importantly, this study answers the question regarding how to choose an appropriate 2.5D PEBI mesh to yield both accurate results and good CPU performance. "

                    "abstract": "Permeability and porosity are two of the key parameters for reservoir simulation. Porosity is essential for estimating original oil/gas in place and for calculating saturation and permeability. For naturally fractured reservoir (NFR) simulation, when matrix porosity is negligible, it is important to estimate proper fracture porosity and permeability in order to obtain more accurate simulation results. However, it is difficult to measure and estimate these parameters because of numerous factors, such as high heterogeneity of fluid and fracture properties, a scale difference between sampling window and real reservoir domain, and so on. In a previous study (Kim and Schechter 2009), a fractal discrete fracture network (FDFN) codes were developed to generate discrete fracture network distributions and to calculate fracture porosity based on outcrop map, core sample and/or image log data. Because it was almost impossible to understand reservoir conditions from limited surveying data, fractal theory was adopted to reduce scale discrepancy errors in simulations. Each generated fracture had constant aperture distribution or normal/log-normal aperture distribution. The aperture distribution characteristics could describe natural like aperture properties. The code directly calculated fracture porosity using generated FDFN geometry data. In this study, we developed codes to estimate the equivalent permeability distributions of large numbers of fractures using a modified Oda's algorithm. A modified Oda's algorithm reflected the heterogeneous nature of fracture networks using the full tensor permeability scheme. Because we used fractal and statistical methods to generate the fracture networks, the generated fracture geometries could have been different, even though same input data were used. Therefore, to generate reliable fracture network results with given input data, we performed FDFN codes 1000 times, using a Monte Carlo simulation. Then, generated fracture numbers and fracture density were calculated. Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of generated fractures was calculated, and P10, P50 and P90 of the fracture networks were estimated. We selected the P50 case as reservoir fracture map. Simulated FDFN data of P50 map were passed to a modified Oda's algorithm, and x and y directional equivalent permeability distributions were calculated. We also developed iteratively coupled fluid flow and geomechanics codes, and simulated the fluid flow in porous media and estimated the interaction effects between two models. With calculated equivalent permeability data, two-phase fluid flow in porous media was first solved by finite difference methods (FDM), and then the calculated pore pressure data were passed to an elasto-plastic geomechanics model to calculate stress/volumetric strain of each element using finite element methods (FEM). The iteration was repeated until the convergence level was below the desired tolerance level and we estimated the interaction effects between fluid flow and geomechanics on reservoir simulation. All codes were written in Matlab. "

                    "abstract": "Multi-stage hydraulically fractured wells are applied widely to produce unconventional resource plays. In naturally fractured reservoirs, hydraulic fracture treatments may induce complex fracture geometries which cannot be modeled accurately and efficiently using Cartesian and corner-point grid systems or standard dual porosity approaches. The interaction of hydraulic and naturally occurring fractures almost certainly plays a role in ultimate well and reservoir performance. Current simulation models are unable to capture the complexity of this interaction. Generally speaking, our ability to detect and characterize fracture systems is far beyond our capability of modeling complex natural fracture systems. In order to evaluate production performance in these complex settings using numerical simulation, fracture networks require advanced meshing and domain discretization techniques. This paper investigates these issues by developing natural fracture networks using fractal-based techniques. Once a fracture network is developed we demonstrate the feasibility of gridding complex natural fracture behavior using optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms. It can then be demonstrated that natural fracture complexities such as variable aperture, spacing, length and strike can be simulated. This new approach is a significant step beyond the current method of dual porosity simulation which essentially negates the sophisticated level of fracture characterization pursued by many operators. We use currently established code for fractal discrete fracture network (FDFN) models to build realizations of naturally fractured reservoirs in terms of stochastic fracture networks. From outcrop, image log and core analysis, it is possible to extract fracture fractal parameters pertaining to aperture, spacing, length distribution, including center distribution as well as a fracture strike. Then these parameters are used as input variables for the FDFN code to generate multiple realizations of fracture networks mimicking fracture clustering and randomly distributed natural fractures. After incorporating hydraulic fractures, complex fracture networks are obtained for further reservoir domain discretization. In order to discretize the complex fracture networks, a new mesh generation approach is developed to conform to non-orthogonal and low-angle intersections of extensive-clustered discrete fracture networks with non-uniform aperture distribution. Optimization algorithms are adopted to reduce highly skewed cells, and to ensure good mesh quality around fracture tips, intersections and regions of extensive fracture clustering. Moreover, Local Grid Refinement (LGR) is implemented with a pre-defined distance function to control cell sizes and shapes around and far away from fractures. Natural fracture spacing, length, strike and aperture distribution are explicitly gridded thus introducing a new simulation approach that is far superior to dual porosity simulation. Finally initial sensitivity studies are performed to demonstrate both the capability of the optimization-based unstructured meshing algorithms, and the effect of aforementioned natural fracture parameters on well performance.

                    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been used commercially to recover oil from reservoirs by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technologies for over 40 years. Currently, CO2 flooding is the second most applied EOR processes in the world behind steamflooding. Water alternating gas (WAG) injection has been a popular method to control mobility and improve volumetric sweep efficiency for CO2 flooding. The average improved recovery is about 9.7%, with a range of 6 to 20% for miscible WAG injection. Despite all the success of WAG injection, sweep efficiency during CO2 flooding is typically a challenge to reach higher oil recovery and better apply the technology. This paper proposes a new combination method called polymer alternating gas (PAG) to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency of the WAG process. The feature of this new method is that polymers are added to water during the WAG process to improve mobility ratio. In the PAG process, polymer flooding and immiscible/miscible CO2 injection are combined. To analyze the feasibility of PAG, models considering both miscible and polymer flooding processes are built to study the performance of PAG. In this paper, the sensitivity of polymer adsorption and concentration are studied. The feasibility of PAG in reservoirs with different permeabilities, different Dykstra-Parsons permeability variation coefficients (VDPs), and different fluids are also studied. A reservoir model from a typical section of the North Burbank Unit (NBU) is used to compare the performance between PAG, WAG, and polymer flooding. This study demonstrates that PAG can significantly improve recovery for immiscible/miscible flooding in homogeneous or heterogeneous reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "CO2 flooding often results in poor sweep efficiency due to the high mobility ratio caused by its low viscosity. To mitigate this problem, the alternate injection of water and CO2 slugs, known as the water-alternating-gas process (WAG), is widely applied. Recently, numerical simulation and core flood experiments indicate that the use of chemicals in the water slug may improve mobility control during WAG, thus increasing the ultimate recovery and reducing the requirements for newly purchased or recycled CO2. Therefore, the study of the stability of common polymers used for EOR applications in CO2 saturated environments becomes necessary to address the technical and economic feasibility of this process. In this paper, we report the results of two commonly applied EOR polymers, a co-polymer of acrylamide and acrylate and a co-polymer of acrylamide and ATBS (Acrylamide tert-Butyl Sulfonate). To establish a base line for comparison, parallel experiments were conducted in two different oxygen free environments: one with CO2 and the other with nitrogen. Samples were hydrated and aged at reservoir temperature over 300 days. To isolate the effect of CO2, polymer thermal and chemical degradation were reduced by stripping out dissolved oxygen and decreasing divalent cation concentration from the water prior to polymer hydration. Polymer samples were removed at different times and their viscosity was measured as a function of shear rate and fitted to a power law model. The ability of the polymer solutions to retain their original viscosity over time was used to quantify polymer degradation. The results of this work show that CO2 impacts polymer stability, causing further degradation in both polymers tested. The co-polymer of acrylamide and ATBS exhibited higher resistance to CO2 degradation as it was able to retain 94 % of its original viscosity, compared with the co-polymer of acrylamide and acrylate which only retained 56 %. Factors as chemical degradation, hydrolysis and pH, that also affected the behavior of viscosity over time are addressed. We conclude that commercial polymers can be used during chemically assisted CO2 WAG when low divalent cation water is used at a reservoir temperature of 122 F. "

                    "abstract": "Wettability alteration in shale formations can be an important factor in improving the performance of hydraulic fracturing treatments. The use of surfactants in the frac fluid, at proper concentrations, has shown to change wettability in Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs (ULR) favoring the process of imbibition. This study evaluates and compares the efficiency of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in recovering hydrocarbons from variable pore size typing in carbonate and siliceous preserved side-wall core. The techniques developed also open the door for investigation of low concentration surfactants for EOR in ULR. Contact angle (CA) experiments were performed, using the captive bubble method, to measure the magnitude of wettability alteration on intermediate to oil-wet ULR core at reservoir temperature (165 °F). Different types of anionic and non-ionic surfactants at field concentration of 3 gallons per thousand gallons (gpt) were used. The results showed that all surfactants lower the CA at the concentration tested. However, anionic surfactants showed better results as observed by lower contact angles. Also, at the same pore size type, carbonate shale cores showed lower contact angles than siliceous shale cores. IFT measurements were also performed, using the pendant drop method, at reservoir temperature using reservoir crude oil and anionic and non-ionic surfactants at the same concentration. The IFT reduction was similar for each type of surfactant compared to regular frac fluid without any surfactant. Computed tomography (CT) scan methods were used to gauge the performance of these surfactants in improving oil recovery. The magnitude of penetration or imbibition into artificially-fractured shale cores was studied for both anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Frac fluids containing surfactants were mixed with a dopant salt to trace the movement of these fluids and measure the penetration numerically. Both, anionic and non-ionic, surfactants have higher penetration magnitudes compared to slick water without surfactant regardless of the lithology. However, anionic surfactants showed superior penetration magnitude and displaced an observable amount of liquid hydrocarbon from the shale cores. This observation agrees qualitatively with the results observed in the CA experiments where anionic surfactants showed the lowest contact angles. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that anionic surfactants alter wettability in these ULR core, giving lower CA, better imbibition and higher oil recovery than nonionic surfactants. These observed wettability changes induced by surfactants mixed in the frac fluids can improve matrix penetration with spontaneous imbibition which opens further discussions for EOR potential in shale formations.

                    "abstract": "The poor rock quality and matrix permeability several orders of magnitude lower than conventional oil reservoirs observed in unconventional liquid reservoirs (ULR) still confounds the industry on the storage capacity of the rock and the possibility of enhancing recovery. The technological advances in multiple stage hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have improved the overall profitability of oil shale plays by enhancing the matrix - wellbore connectivity. The combination of these technologies has become the key factor for the operators to reach economically attractive production rates in the exploitation of ULR, causing a lot of focus on their improvement. However, as the reservoir matures, primary production mechanisms no longer drive oil to the hydraulic fractures, making the improvement of matrix - wellbore connectivity insufficient to provide economically attractive production rates. Therefore, the need to develop enhanced recovery techniques in order to improve the displacement of the oil from the matrix, maintain profitable production rates, extend the life of the assets and increase ultimate oil recovery becomes evident. This study presents experimental results on the use of CO2 as an EOR agent in preserved, rotary sidewall reservoir core with negligible permeability. To simulate the presence of hydraulic fractures, the ULR core was surrounded by a high permeability glass beads and packed in a core holder. The high permeability media was then saturated with CO2 at constant pressure and temperature during the experiment. Production was monitored over this time period. The experiment was imaged using x-ray computed tomography to track saturation changes inside the core samples. The results of this investigation support CO2 as a promising EOR agent for oil shale reservoirs. Oil recovery was estimated to be between 20 to 50 % of OOIP. We provide a detailed description of the experimental set up and procedures. The analysis of the x-ray computed tomography images revealed obvious saturation changes within the ULR core as a result of CO2 injection. A discussion about the mechanisms is presented, including diffusion and reduction in capillary forces. This paper opens a door to the inevitable investigation of CO2 enhanced oil recovery in ULR. "

Currently, CO2 flooding is the second most applied enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process in the world behind steam flooding. Water alternating gas (WAG) injection has been a popular method to control mobility and improve volumetric sweep efficiency for CO2 flooding. Average EOR is about 9.7% with a range between 6 and 20% for miscible WAG injection. Despite all the success of WAG injection, sweep efficiency during CO2 flooding is a typical challenge to reach higher oil recovery. We applied polymer-alternating-gas (PAG), in which polymer flooding is combined with miscible CO2 injection, to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency of the WAG process in TR78 of the North Burbank Unit. High heterogeneity and high permeability at the top layers are the two main challenges of the North Burbank Unit. Then, we compared PAG performance with WAG and continuous gas injection (CGI). Polymer concentration and injection slug patterns were optimized during the PAG process. Simulation results show that PAG would increase oil recovery about 14.3% compared with 7.3% for WAG in TR78. This study can not only be used to guide the development of the North Burbank Unit, but also to demonstrate that encouraging recovery can be obtained in high-heterogeneity reservoirs by using PAG. "

                    "abstract": "With the production from mature oil fields declining, the increasing demand of oil urges towards more effective recovery of the available resources. Currently, the CO2 floods are the second most applied EOR processes in the world behind steam injection. With more than 40 years of experience gained from CO2 flooding, successful projects have demonstrated incremental oil recovery ranging from 7 to 15 % of the oil initially in place. Despite all of the success of CO2 floods, sweep efficiency during CO2 flooding is typically the stumbling block to better application of the technology. Poor sweep efficiency results in early breakthrough and extraction ineffectiveness leaving zones of high oil saturation intact. Conformance control approach employs gel treatments to act as a blocking agents reducing channeling through fractures or high-permeability zones of oil reservoir without significantly damaging hydrocarbon productivity and improve the overall oil recovery from the flooding process. Accordingly, the goal of the gel is to maximize gel penetration and permeability reduction in high permeable zone while minimizing gel penetration and permeability reduction in less permeable zones of the reservoir. A successful treatment will direct the CO2 away from the high permeability zones towards the lower permeability intact regions. The gel conformance control studies showed encouraging results in minimizing the effect of heterogeneities directing the injected CO2 to extract more oil from the lower permeability zones; the gel strength was evaluated in terms of breakdown and leakoff utilizing the production data aided with CT imaging analysis. Viscosified water during WAG coupled with CO2 shows great promising results proving the superiority over continuous CO2 injection or WAG. This research aims at investigating gel treatments and viscosified water-alternating-gas CO2 mobility control techniques. A set of experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed mobility control approaches. Our research employed an imaging technique integrating an X-Ray CT scanner to obtain real time images when processed provide qualitative and qualitative evaluations to the coreflood to quantify and visualize improved sweep efficiency.  Introduction Even with the recent advances in alternative energy sources, oil remains and expected to remain the major energy source in the world. See Fig.1. With the production from mature oil fields declining, the increasing demand of oil urges towards more effective recovery of the available resources. Currently, the CO2 Floods are the second most applied EOR processes in the world behind steam injection. See Fig.2. (Espie 2005) Despite all of the anticipated success of CO2 floods, its viscosity nature is in heterogeneous and naturally fractured reservoirs is challenging;CO2 will flow preferentially through the easiest paths resulting in early breakthrough and extraction ineffectiveness leaving zones of oil intact.(Jarrell 2002) Gel application is considered the most aggressive type of conformance control. Conformance control approach employs gel treatments to act as a blocking agents reducing channeling through fractures or high-permeability zones of oil reservoir without significantly damaging hydrocarbon productivity and improve the overall oil recovery from the flooding process. Accordingly, the goal of the gel is to maximize gel penetration and permeability reduction in high permeable zone while minimizing gel penetration and permeability reduction in less permeable zones of the reservoir.

                    "abstract": "Shale gas/oil wells are a challenge due to the complex reservoirs and well completion designs. Commercial simulators with new automatic features play an important role in shale reservoir characterization. These commercial simulators include special features for modeling horizontal, multi-fracked shale wells with simplified user interfaces. The primary goal of this paper is to compare the simulation of transient and boundary dominated flow with analytical solutions through specialized rate function plots. These comparisons provide a straightforward means for testing the accuracy of automatic gridding features and the simulation methodology. If simulators can match idealized reservoirs accurately, then confidence improves in the matching of actual field cases that may vary from idealized reservoir behavior. In this work, we tested the accuracy of these simulator features by making numerous simulation runs for various geological and geometric scenarios. We considered different simulation gridding and system models to correctly represent the transient linear flow and its effect on the analysis. Some general gridding rules were developed. This work investigates the use of an effective permeability equation from analytical solution and its application to several wells in reservoirs located in the Bakken, Barnett, and Eagle Ford formations. Simulation was used to confirm the equation's accuracy and to show its applicability in fractured shale reservoirs. Results from this investigation should help engineers select the best automatic features to accurately represent shale wells and then cross check the results using the analytical solution. This study also expanded our understanding of flow behavior in production data which may be used to improve modeling shale wells for better agreement with the analytical solutions. Introduction There have been many recent papers discussing the modeling of shale horizontal wells with multi-transverse hydraulic. Rubin (2010) was modeling shale gas reservoirs using simplified models but comparing the models with reference simulation models of fine grids. Most authors did not use analytical solutions as mean of comparison which is the main focus of this paper. Transient and boundary dominated flow regime is of main emphases for comparison between special simple features in simulators and analytical solutions. Unlike most simulation papers, this paper will be discussing four field examples of oil and gas shale formations from Bakken, Barnett, and Eagle Ford. Two main transient flow regimes are of interest in this paper, linear and bilinear flow. The flow can be from three parts of the reservoir, matrix, natural fracture and hydraulic fracture. It is believed that the transient effect of the hydraulic fracture flow will die out in hours and it will not show up in the daily production data. This will lead a general assumption in this paper, the hydraulic fracture is infinitely conductive and the entire flow is from matrix or matrix and natural fractures. In the work being reported, we investigated the simulation of linear flow and the effect of different gridding refinement for the hydraulic fracture modification. We compared the results of simulator with analytical solution using a procedure presented for shale wells. An effective permeability equation was used to calculate drainage area and match the production data accurately in homogenous reservoir. Some rules were developed on when to use simulator or analytical solution for a transient bilinear flow. These rules were applied to field examples.  "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We have performed a miscible CO2 flood study using fractured and unfractured carbonate cores and 31° API west Texas oil to evaluate oil recovery under three main injection modes: SWAG, WAG, and CGI. For each injection mode, three cases were considered: unfractured, one horizontal fracture and two fractures (one horizontal and one vertical). Increasing the number of fractures will investigate different shape factors such as the elongated slab and sugar cube models. Then, a commercial simulator was used to match the experimental results and model the fractures.  The experimental results may be summarized as follows. First, for the unfractured case, the oil recoveries for SWAG, WAG, and CGI are 98, 92, and 75 % of OOIP, respectively. Second, for the elongated slab case (one horizontal fracture), the oil recoveries for SWAG, WAG and CGI decreased to 72, 70, and 27 %, respectively. Third, for sugar cube model (two fractures), the oil recoveries for SWAG, WAG and CGI are 79, 79, and 55 %, respectively. The simulation shows that the improvement in recoveries during SWAG and WAG over CGI is a result of a better conformance provided by the injected water which hindered CO2 mobility and decreased its cycling through the fracture. Also, the sugar cube model has shown better results than the elongated slab because of the presence of a vertical fracture in the middle which helped CO2 to diffuse more in the matrix and contact oil. The results suggest that injecting CGI in fractured cases is not recommended and injecting water (wetting phase) along with CO2 is essential. Finally, among all injection modes, SWAG has resulted in the most uniform displacement profile with the lowest residual oil saturation after the flood. This injection mode combines the benefits of water to transfer into the matrix with CO2 excellent displacement. "

                    "abstract": "Chemical flooding methods are used to recover residual oil left after water flooding. Several recovery mechanisms were suggested to improve the displacement effectiveness of the trapped oil. Reducing IFT, mobility control and wettability alteration are the main recovery mechanisms during chemical flooding. Understanding which recovery mechanism that dominate during recovery process helps selecting and optimizing which chemical process to be used.  An experimental study of 4 chemical flood experiments were visualized with computed tomography (CT) in sandstone cores at room temperature. The experiments were conducted to study four different chemical flooding processes: polymer, surfactant, surfactant-polymer (SP), and alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP). Oil recovery, and oil distribution in the core were evaluated after the chemical flood.  The experimental results obtained from the core flooding experiment shows best recovery was during ASP and SP flooding with some residual reduction in permeability caused by using polymers. The lowest recovery was obtained during surfactant flooding, which prove that IFT reduction can't improve recovery without the aid of mobility control by polymers.  Introduction Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) involves injection of fluids to displace the hydrocarbon in the porous media. Chemical flooding is one of these processes that are used for recovery enhancement. Surfactants, polymers and alkalis were evaluated separately and in combination by several researchers. Core flood studies are performed to simulate the immiscible displacement in porous media and cores are flooded with chemical at residual oil saturation Sorw. During chemical flooding process four flow regions are established which can be seen from the core effluent. The four regions starting from the core outlet are (i) initial two-phase flow at Sorw, (ii) oil bank in with increase in saturation, (iii) two or three phase flow of oil, water and microemulsion, and (iv) single-phase flow of the chasing fluid (Austad and Taugbol 1995). Understanding the flow behavior inside the porous media and its effect on the recovery can explain the different recovery values for each chemical method.  Core flood experiements are used to determine the oil recovery during secondary and tertiary mode. One of the most important output of this experiment is the recovery curve which is used to predict the performance of different flooding processes. This curve is generated by collecting the effluent coming out of the sample without knowing the bath or the displacement mechanism that resulted in this recovery. For this reason the ability to observe the in-situ displacement and saturation distribution at different displacement stages will help better understanding the process.  Peters and Hardham (1990) used X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to observe the in-situ displacement processes in number of core flood experiments. They were able to see three displacement mechanisms for unstable miscible flooding; 1) displacement from the fresh area of the core not contacted by initial finger, 2) displacement of the areas of the core contacted by the initial finger, and 3) displacement from the edge of the initial finger due to the lateral growth by dispersion. However in the case of unstable immiscible displacement, only the second displacement mechanism take place which results in slight increase in recovery after breakthrough. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Assessing reservoir connectivity during the earliest stages of reservoir evaluation is highly desirable for successful field development. Nevertheless, it has long been problematic to assess reservoir connectivity prior to production. Recently, downhole fluid analysis has enabled facile assessment of fluid compositional gradients vertically and latterally. Using equations of state, the extent of fluid compositional equilibrium can be established. Only a process that stretches across the entire age of the reservoir is likely to capture geologic events that cause compartmentalization. Fluid composition equilibration requires mixing of the entire content of the reservoir which occurs only on the geologic time scale. Restrictive flow barriers are not compatible with thorough mixing of fluids throughout the reservoir. Fluid composition equilibration provides a tight constraint to test connectivity. In this paper, the time constants for fluid composition equilibration are evaluated in numerical simulations. Equilibration processes are simulated in a simplified model over geologic timescales at isothermal conditions where diffusion and gravity are the active mechanisms. A variety of initial conditions and reservoir fluid types are considered. The effect of barriers on the equilibration time is investigated for single and multiple barriers. The results are compared with analytical calculations. Longer equilibration times correspond to tighter constraints on connectivity. This work shows the progression of compositional gradients over geologic time until all components have reached zero mass flux. It investigates the foundation of connectivity studies that rely on fluid composition. Determination of fluid equilibrium should become part of the standard procedure for reservoir connectivity evaluation.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Assessing reservoir connectivity during the earliest stages of reservoir evaluation is highly desirable for successful field development. Static pressure measurements with wireline formation testers have been used to assess compartmentalization; if two permeable zones are not in pressure communication, they are not in flow communication. However, the presumption that pressure communication implies flow communication has repeatedly proven to be incorrect. Pressure equilibration requires relatively low mass flow compared to fluid composition equilibration. Thus pressure communication does not impose a stringent condition on connectivity. In contrast, fluid composition equilibration requires mixing of the entire content of the reservoir. Fluid composition equilibration provides a correspondingly much more rigorous set of conditions to determine connectivity.  In this paper, a comparison is made between the time constants for pressure versus fluid composition equilibration for identical reservoir parameters. A reservoir model is designed to simulate numerically equilibration processes over geologic timescales at isothermal conditions where diffusion and gravity are the active mechanisms. A variety of initial conditions and reservoir fluid types are considered. The fluid component with the largest molecular weight and volume is expected to have the longest equilibration time. For black oil, this work accounts for asphaltene nanoaggregates in their own component group. The results are compared with analytical calculations. Longer equilibration times correspond to tighter constraints on connectivity.  Fluid composition equilibration is seen to constrain connectivity by 6 or more orders of magnitude beyond pressure equilibration. The equilibration time of the asphaltenes nanoaggregates exceeds the the compositional equilibration of all other fluid components by a factor of five.  Only a process that stretches across the entire age of the reservoir is likely to capture geologic events that cause compartmentalization. Consequently, the evaluation of the distribution of fluid compositions is shown to be a far better method to test for connectivity than pressure communication.

                    "abstract": "Acid stimulation is commonly used in carbonate reservoirs, which can be either matrix acidizing or acid fracturing. In both treatments, wormholes can form. In matrix acidizing, wormholing is favorable because the damaged region can be bypassed. In acid fracturing, wormholing is not desired because it can increase fluid loss, which can limit conductive fracture length. Three major processes are involved for wormholing: convection, diffusion and surface reaction. A thorough understanding of these processes is necessary for engineering design. In this paper, we fundamentally explore wormholing mechanisms starting from pore growth. A wormhole forms when larger pores grow in cross-sectional area at a rate that greatly exceeds the growth rate of smaller pores due to surface reaction. This happens when pore growth follows a particular mechanism, which is discussed in this paper. We developed a model to predict wormhole growth behavior. The model uses the mode-size pore in a pore size distribution - the pore size that appears most frequently in a distribution - to predict the growth of the pore. By controlling the acid velocity inside of it, we can make larger pores grow much faster than other smaller pores, thus reaching the most favorable condition for wormholing. This also results in a balance between overall acid/rock reaction and acid flow. By understanding the wormholing mechanism, engineers can select proper treatment fluids and pumping rate for acid stimulation design. "

                    "abstract": "Downhole temperature data obtained by either temperature logging or fiber-optic cables have been used to evaluate stimulation treatments and post-stimulation performance of horizontal wells with multiple fractures. Field cases qualitatively show capabilities of detecting creation of transverse fractures, poor zonal isolation, and inflow locations, although downhole temperature behavior in those wells is not fully understood from the theoretical modeling perspective. In this study, we present comprehensive numerical flow and thermal models for a horizontal well with multiple fractures. The well experiences single-phase water flow during injection and shut-in, and gas/water two-phase flow during production. These models are formulated for reservoir and wellbore domains with consideration of their coupling. The reservoir models are formulated in 3D space using mass conservation of each component and thermal energy conservation with Darcy’s law in transient conditions. The wellbore models are also transient, and formulated for 1D space using mass conservation of each component, conservation of combined-phase momentum, and total energy conservation. The wellbore- and sandface-temperature profiles are obtained as solutions of these models. These models enable us to simulate field operations in multistage-fracturing treatment; injection and shut-in occur alternately for each stage from toe to heel with zonal isolation. After the stimulation treatments, these models are used to simulate temperature behavior during production in gas/water two-phase flow. We show an example of a single fracture in which the developed model simulates temperature behavior during injection, shut-in, and production to show capabilities of the developed model. This study shows that injected fluid makes the fluid temperature in the fracture lower than the geothermal temperature even after 1 month of shut-in. This affects the temperature interpretation during production because the initial temperature is different from the geothermal temperature assumed as the initial temperature by most studies published previously. A synthetic case with five fractures demonstrates capabilities of detection of created-fracture locations from the shut-in temperature profile. In addition, we apply the model to a field case of distributed-temperature-sensor (DTS) temperature profiles during warmback after multistage hydraulic fracturing, and 30 days after the start of the production in this well. The good match obtained between this model and the DTS data from this well indicates how this modeling approach can be used to estimate the production from individual perforation clusters. The case studies illustrate qualitative interpretations in situations occurring in fields, such as warm-up behavior with multiple clusters during the shut-in period. This paper provides insights from the theoretical modeling perspective for downhole temperature interpretation qualitatively performed at the current time. It also discusses the validity of the assumptions made in previous studies and precautions relevant to those assumptions. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting is a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, with observed positive production enhancement in some extended-reach horizontal wells. It is a process in which a reactive chemical solution is injected at a high rate at specific entry points via relatively smaller nozzles. The flow out of the nozzles is designed to be a fully turbulent jet which impinges on the porous surface of the rock, leading to a dissolution structure. That dissolution structure is of great interest as it determines the quality of the well stimulation job, which correlates directly to the well productivity. This work is the second step in the overall project about a comprehensive study of acid jetting as a successful stimulation method for carbonate formations. The first step was an experimental study performed using a linear core-flood setup including a jetting nozzle. The objective was to understand the mechanism of acid jetting on carbonate cores and identify the important parameters in the experimental outcome. The current study aims at describing acid jetting from a mathematical standpoint, while using experimental results as model validation and improvement tools. Previously published acid jetting laboratory experiments results revealed the recurring creation of a large dissolution structure at the impingement location in the shape of a cavity and, depending on injection conditions, the propagation of wormholes through the core. A core-scale computational fluid dynamics model has been developed to simulate cavity and wormhole growth in acid jetting. It is a three-dimensional model which alternates between the two fundamental aspects of the overall acid jetting process. Firstly, it models the fluid mechanics of the turbulent jet exiting the nozzle and continuously impinging on the porous media transient surface. The jet fluid dynamics are implemented using a 3D transient finite volume numerical solver using Large Eddy Simulations (LES) with the Smagorinsky-Lilly sub-grid model to solve the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. The results of this simulation include a velocity and pressure distribution at the porous media surface. Secondly, it models an irreversible chemical reaction with dissolution and transport at the impingement location between the fluid and the rock matrix. The reactive transport is modeled using the conventional kinetics of the dissolution of calcite by hydrochloric acid. This two-step model successfully replicates experimental results and observations for the cavity growth. It can then be coupled with a wormhole growth model to represent the entire experimental acid jetting outcome. The modeling and computational tool for acid jetting developed in this paper will build the understanding for the upscaling and integrated dynamic modeling of an acid jetting stimulation job in the field. It will thus lead to the establishment of a standard for predicting and improving field applications of acid jetting. "

                    "abstract": "Modeling acid fracturing operations in carbonate formations is performed to evaluate the possible improvement in well productivity. Models are developed to mainly estimate the acid penetration length and the fracture surfaces etched-width profile. Variable combinations of these two parameters produce a significant difference in the fracture productivity. To better estimate these parameters, a reliable fracture propagation model should be coupled with the acid reaction/transport model. Simulating weak acids or dolomite formations reactivity requires the inclusion of a heat transfer model. The model provided in this study couples these factors as fractures propagate to finally obtain the fracture conductivity distribution along its length. The fracture propagation model continuously updates the domain for the acid model. A transient acid convection and diffusion equation is solved and the fracture etched-width profile is calculated. An iterative procedure is implemented in a temperature dependent kinetic model which is stopped when both the temperature and acid solutions converge. When injection stops, acid etching and the fluids temperature are updated as the fracture closes. As the final etching profile is drawn, conductivity is calculated using a correlation that considers formation heterogeneity. Coupling fracture propagation shows a significant difference on the acid model solutions compared to that assuming constant fracture geometry. For extremely high Peclet number that represents a very retarded acid system, a constant drop in the etched-width value until reaching zero at the fracture tip is theoretically obtainable. For lower Peclet numbers, the etching profile is shown to be sharply declining towards the fracture end. This is in contrast with the non-coupled approach from which a uniform etching profile is obtained at moderate to high Peclet numbers. It is also observed that the simulation of acid injection in non-coupled, constant fracture geometry always overestimates the acid penetration distance. The etched-width distribution and the acid penetration length are temperature sensitive, especially in dolomite formations. Temperature coupling shows that the maximum etching in dolomite formations occurs away from the fracture entrance as acid reactivity increases. It also shows that the cooling effects of the first stage pad fluid on improving the acid penetration distance is limited. Simulating acid fracturing operations assuming constant final fracture geometry and an average single temperature is time efficient but results in inaccurate solution. This paper quantifies the effects of integrating fracture propagating and heat transfer models on the acid etching pattern from which, a better estimate of the fracture productivity is expected. "

                    "abstract": "The temperature log as a part of a production logging package has been used in the industry for many years. Recent developments in downhole fiber optic sensing technology introduced a more continuous measurement of temperature both temporally and spatially for flow diagnosis. One of the powerful applications of temperature measurements is to diagnose multistage fracture treatments. Because the fiber optic temperature measurements can be available during fracturing, during shut-in, and during production, the integrated interpretation provides information of fracture/flow distribution. This information helps to understand what happened during fracture treatments, to identify problems in treatment design and execution, and to improve the efficiency of multistage fracture stimulation. The key component of fracturing diagnosis by temperature measurements is the interpretation models. In this paper, we present the models developed for fracture diagnosis. The mathematical models are built on mass, momentum and energy conservation of each component (reservoir, fracture, well completion and wellbore) in the system, and the components are linked through the boundary conditions. All models can be solved numerically, but for computational efficiency, analytical/semianalytical solutions are preferred when available. To correctly simulate heat transfer during fracture propagation, a fracture geometry model with appropriate leak off description is integrated into the model buildup. For flow problem in a fractured well, analytical model, streamline approach and reservoir simulation can all be the solution methods. The paper compares the advantages of each approach. Field cases from the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus shale formations are presented in the paper to illustrate how the models can be used to generate the fracture/flow distribution. The results show that temperature measurement is a comprehensive tool for fracture diagnosis. "

                    "abstract": "Rock mineralogy is one of the factors that affect optimal acid injection conditions for carbonate reservoirs. Extensive research has been done to study the optimal acidizing conditions for limestone. However, very few studies have been reported on acidizing dolomite rocks. This paper presents an experimental study on acidizing dolomite rock samples. In this research, we cut a dolomite block from a Silurian formation in Thornton Quarry, Illinois. This block was drilled into core samples with dimensions of 1.5-in. diameter by 8-in. long. We first measured the mineralogy of the rock samples to ensure the lithology to be studied. The test shows that more than 99% of the rock mineral is dolomite. To study the effectiveness of acidizing, we then did acidizing coreflood experiments with 15 wt% HCl at different temperatures. These temperatures are 122 °F, 185 °F and 260 °F. Wormhole efficiency relationships were generated, and the optimal acid injection conditions were determined respectively from these experiments. The dissolution patterns created during each experiment was found by CT-scanning each core after acid injection. Experimental results show that the optimal acid interstitial velocity increases with increasing temperature. However, the rate of increase between 122 °F and 185 °F is significantly larger than the rate of increase between 185 °F and 260 °F. It is due to the difference of increase for acid diffusion rate and surface reaction rate, which is discussed in this paper. Interestingly, unlike limestone, the corresponding optimal breakthrough pore volume decreases with increasing temperature from 122 °F to 185 °F, and increases slightly from 185 °F to 260 °F. This indicates that more volume of acid is needed for reservoirs of lower temperature. Based on the experimental results and an upscaling method, an application scheme is presented for dolomite reservoirs with varying temperatures, which can be used for engineering references. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting, as a well-stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended-reach horizontal wells. It was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore by means of multiple strategically located injection nozzles. It has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation. Jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing. The hypotheses for the design of more-efficient stimulation treatments are currently being investigated. We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency. Each jetting experiment was conducted as a constant-pressure (equivalent to a desired initial flux through the core) linear coreflood test, in which a standoff distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core. At low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter cake by mechanical actions. Jetting also creates wormholes in limestone cores. The combination of mechanical and chemical reaction stimulates limestone rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle. When the jetting velocity increased, the dissolution pattern changed. An isolated local compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure. With the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome. We used Indiana and Winterset limestone rocks in the experiments. A 15% hydrochloric acid (HCl) (by weight) at ambient temperature was used, and the core dimensions were 4 in. in diameter and 16 in. in length. Various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered. The Winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the Indiana limestone cores. The experimental results from the two different rock samples are compared. Overall, the experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing, regarding wormhole propagation after cavities are created. Jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results. Acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for the cores from Indiana limestone and Winterset limestone. The observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic physical and chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid-stimulation jobs. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting occurs as a result of pumping acid through limited entry liner completions, causing high velocity streams to impinge against the wellbore wall. The dissolution effect of jetting differs significantly from conventional matrix acidizing. Acid jetting causes cavities to be formed at the points of contact of the jet with the rock, with wormholes forming beyond the cavity. Jetting has been shown to be an effective technique for placing acid along extended reach laterals, removing filter cake, and enhancing wormhole propagation. The velocity of the impinging jet and its standoff distance from the rock causes some of the acid to penetrate the formation and some to flow back in the annular space of the liner. Two types of dissolution mechanisms occur: surface dissolution forming the cavity, and matrix dissolution forming the wormholes. These dissolution mechanisms are highly dependent on acid injection rate, velocity of the jet, temperature, and permeability of the formation. The differences between the matrix dissolution mechanism of acid jetting and that of conventional matrix acidizing are most obvious at low acid injection rates. Experiments were performed with the intention of quantifying the difference in pore volume to breakthrough between acid jetting and matrix acidizing, as well as determining the effect of increased temperature, rock permeability and acid concentration on this value with respect to acid injection rate. Baseline parameters of room temperature, 15% HCl and 2-4 mD Indiana limestone were individually compared with experiments run at 180°F, 28% HCl, and Indiana limestone cores of 30, 60 mD, and 140 mD. The effect of jetting velocity was also investigated by changing the diameter of the orifice from which the stream exits. Direct comparison with conventional matrix acidizing was made by eliminating the jetting effect of the stream through mechanical dispersion. Acid jetting creates a point of heightened interstitial velocity at the contact of the acid and the rock, causing wormhole propagation to happen at a faster rate than it would in conventional matrix acidizing at that injection rate. This effect is especially pronounced as jetting velocity is raised above that of matrix acidizing, and tapers off at progressively higher jetting velocities. "

                    "abstract": "It was recently shown that anisotropic wormhole networks may arise from the acidizing of anisotropic carbonates. In openhole or cased and densely perforated completions, where in isotropic formations the wormhole network would be expected to be radial around the well, the actual stimulated region may be elliptical in anisotropic formations. Analogously, in completions where the limited entry technique is used, the wormhole network is expected to be spherical in isotropic formations, but it may actually be ellipsoidal in anisotropic formations. That has an impact on the well performance and should be taken into account when designing the acidizing treatment and the completion. At the same time, the use of a limited entry technique may result in better stimulation coverage and also longer wormholes, but it may also result in a partial completion skin factor, impairing the productivity from the stimulated well. This should be taken into account when estimating the stimulated well productivity. In this study two main topics are analyzed: the impact of wormhole network anisotropy and the impact of a limited entry completion. Both radial and spherical wormhole propagation patterns are considered, to be applied in both openhole and limited entry completions. The differences in well performance is studied for each case, and analytical equations for the skin factor resulting from each scenario are presented. The anisotropic wormhole networks are obtained from numerical simulations using the averaged continuum model, and the results are validated with experimental data. The analysis of the well performance is made through simulation of the flow in the reservoir with the different stimulated regions. The results show that for highly anisotropic formations the wormhole network anisotropy may have a great impact on the acidized well performance and this should be taken into account in the acidizing treatment design. It was observed that the anisotropic wormhole networks present lower productivity than equally sized isotropic stimulated regions. Hence, equations like Hawkins formula should not be used for estimating the skin factor from anisotropic wormhole networks, and the equations proposed in this work should be used instead. Specifically, the impact of anisotropic wormhole networks is large when the limited entry technique is used. It is shown that for this type of completion there is an optimum stimulation coverage of about 60 to 70%, and the perforation density required to obtain for a given acid volume depends strongly on the wormholes' anisotropy. The skin factor equations proposed in this work for the stimulation with limited entry completion should be used for obtaining the optimum perforation density for a given scenario. "

                    "abstract": "During an acid fracturing treatment in a carbonate reservoir, acid is injected into the formation creating hydraulic fractures and opening existing natural fractures. As the acid flows into natural fractures intersecting hydraulic fractures (main fractures), it etches the walls of the natural fracture, which increases the natural fractures' width and generates conductivity. On the other hand, because of the existence of natural fractures, the acid volume in the main fracture reduces, resulting in less conductivity for the main fracture. Existing acid fracturing models estimate the fracture conductivity by assuming the acid flows and reacts in the hydraulic fractures only. In order to accurately predict the performance of acid fracturing in naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs, the acid etching of natural fractures should be taken into account when calculating the overall fracture conductivity. A model is developed to predict the acid fracturing performance in naturally fractured reservoirs. The model assumes that the main fracture is intersected by transverse symmetric natural fractures. The model simulates the acid transport, acid-rock reaction, fracture width increase due to etching of fracture walls, and acid leakoff through natural fractures. The model also assumes that the flow into natural fractures and the leakoff are pressure dependent and are changing with time. The conductivity calculation is based on the previously developed correlation that takes into account the small scale rock heterogeneities. The conductivity of natural fractures was found to be a strong function of the leakoff Peclet number, which depends on the velocity of acid flow into natural fractures from an intersecting hydraulic fracture. The effect of natural fractures' geometry on leakoff Peclet number and created fracture conductivity was investigated. The results show that both length and dynamic width, as well as the number of natural fractures, play a significant role in defining the leakoff rate and the conductivity of the hydraulic fracture and the natural fractures. It was also found that the position of the natural fractures along the hydraulic fracture length affects the etching of the natural fractures and the resultant conductivity. The model will enable the prediction of acid fracture conductivity for naturally fractured reservoirs and improve the feasibility of acid fracturing applications for these type of formations. "

                    "abstract": "Acid fracturing stimulation involves several major steps; a hydraulically induced fracture is created by pad fluids first, then reactive fluids are injected into the fracture, often alternating with a viscous pad to create etched fracture length. When pumping stops, the fracture closes up, and conductivity is created by an uneven fracture surface. An integrated modeling approach is introduced to simulate acid fracturing processes and diagnose operation problems. The integrated design/diagnose approach includes a fracture propagation model for fracture geometry, an acid transport model and a well performance model. The fracture geometry model is coupled with a 3D acid fracturing model to simulate acid transport and the resultant fracture conductivity. The fracture conductivity is then utilized in the well performance model to predict the well productivityafter treatment. This simulated well performance can be used to match the production data to verify the models. In this field case study, we did not have the information about formation leakoff to start the fracture geometry model. To successfully analyze the well treatment, a three step inversion workflow was proposed. The inversion workflow started from estimating a skin factor after stimulation by matching the production data. This skin factor was then converted to a fracture length that resulted in the production history. A pseudo 3D fracture model was used to predict fracture geometry. With the fixed length as a constraint, we varied the leakoff coefficient until we obtained the correct geometry. The simulated fracture geometry from the fracture propagation model was used as an input in the 3D acid fracturing model to simulate the fracture conductivity profile. The conductivity was confirmed with the fracture conductivity from lab experimental test result. To close the analysis loop, the conductivity should also be consistent with the one used in production history matching. Fracture geometry was generated by the commercial software, MFrac, and acid fracturing was simulated by a 3D model developed before. Two wells are selected for the field case study to illustrate the application of the approach, with one well has improved productivity after acid fracturing, and the other has no response after acid fracturing. By applying the inversed integrated 3D acid fracturing modeling workflow, it showed that the well with high productivity had a fracture conductivity resembling the conductivity values fromthe experimental lab measurements. The well with low productivity showed poor fracture length and width, leading to a low production. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional rock classification in carbonate reservoirs typically requires considerable amount of core data, which usually may not be available at the depth resolution required for each target interval. In cases of tight carbonate rocks with extremely low porosity (less than 5% in average) and permeability (less than 0.1 md), a reliable rock classification is essential for well stimulation modeling. Such rock classification should take into account depth-by-depth petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties of the formation. In this paper, we apply an integrated rock classification technique to enhance (a) well-log-based estimates of petrophysical, compositional, and elastic properties and (b) selection of appropriate candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design in a tight carbonate reservoir in northern slope of Tazhong Uplift, Tarim Basin, China. We first perform multi-mineral analysis and estimate volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and fluid saturations. Since shear wave sonic logs are not available in most of the wells, we estimate elastic moduli using effective medium models including self-consistent approximation and differential effective medium theory. Corrections including the impact of fluids are developed using Biot-Gassmann fluid substitution. The inputs to the effective medium models include (a) the petrophysical and compositional properties obtained from well logs, (b) bulk and shear moduli for each mineral and fluid component, and (c) shape of rock inclusions (i.e., grains and pores). Core measurements are used for cross validating the well-log-based estimates of elastic moduli and petrophysical properties. Accordingly, we proposed a rock classification technique using unsupervised neural network that integrated depth-by-depth volumetric concentrations of minerals, porosity, and elastic moduli. Finally, we derived permeability models in each rock type and estimated the permeability in the target depth intervals. Variogram analysis on well-log-based estimates of permeability provides correlation lengths as inputs to acid fracturing treatment modeling. We successfully applied the technique introduced here to a challenging tight gas interval of Tarim field in China. The estimated porosity and permeability were in good agreement with laboratory core measurements. The identified rock classes were verified by core samples and thin sections. We estimated elastic moduli with average relative errors of approximately 13% compare to the core measurements. The estimated elastic moduli were used as a key input for modeling of acid-fracturing treatments and improved stimulation success. The rock classification technique introduced here provides important input parameters for well stimulation modeling, gives insight into evaluation of acid fracturing in tight carbonate reservoir, and helps with selection of best candidate zones for acid fracturing treatment design.

A challenge that has come about from the use of distributed acoustic sensing system is processing, interpretation, and diagnosis of the vast amounts of data produced. Unlike distributed temperature sensing, the data provided by DAS is originally presented in sound amplitude as a function of time. For a defined time interval, the data is first translated to amplitude as a function of frequency, and then the characteristics of both amplitude and frequency is related to flow conditions. Using the characteristics of amplitude and frequency to understand flow distribution is mostly qualitative in the field today. This study started with building a physical simulator in the lab and flowing nitrogen gas through a parallel-plate fracture cell with proppant packs of different permeabilities. A horizontal wellbore section was connected to the fracture cell through a perforation to simulate fractured well flow. Data was collected using an array of microphones distributed along the length of the simulated horizontal wellbore and a directional hydrophone at the toe of the simulated wellbore. The amplitude-frequency characteristic of this acoustic signal is obtained from raw measurements of acoustic pressure via Fast Fourier Transform. A relationship between flow rate and sound pressure level is proposed based on the observation of experiments. With the lab observation, we then modeled acoustic wave behavior in a domain consisting of a perforation and a pipe. Computational fluid dynamics simulation was carried out to simulate the gas flow through the perforation, and the simulated acoustic signals were compared with the lab-observed signals. Modeling of the fluid flow is subdivided into two parts: fluid flow through the proppant pack near the perforation, and fluid flow through the perforation into the wellbore. The proppant pack is described as a set of spherical particles which allows creation of an analogy of the porous structure. In the second part of the simulation, we assume steady state fluid flow through the perforation into the wellbore. This fluid flow creates a noise which is measured along the center of the wellbore. Different types of proppant packing were considered during simulation of the first part of the model. A two-size mesh model was used as the most complex type of packing in this research. Simulations of fluid flow through these structures were conducted for incompressible and compressible fluids. These results allow defining the pressure profile in the inlet of the perforation. For the second part of modeling the main pressure drop is observed along the perforation. Noise is induced from fluid flow out of this perforation with a small diameter in comparison with the diameter of the wellbore. Simulation of 10 seconds of fluid flow was conducted in order to collect enough data for acoustic measurements. Acoustic wave peaks are observed in the amplitude-frequency characteristic plot, and these peaks respond to the different types of fluid and flow rates. Sound pressure level is obtained from amplitude-frequency characteristics and is compared with experimental results. "

                    "abstract": "Today there are still many challenges in the quantitative interpretation of downhole distributed temperature measurements to diagnose multistage fracture treatments in horizontal wells. These challenges include handling enormous amount of data measured by the sensors continuously in time and space domain, a readily-to-be-used fast but robust forward model to simulate temperature behavior, and an efficient algorithm to inverse the parameters that are of interest. Because multistage fracturing involves many uncertain parameters; ranging from reservoir properties to treatment design, to fracture geometries and conductivity; the problem is extremely complex when inverse the measured temperature to a downhole flow profile. This study presents an approach to combine forward and inversion models to interpret downhole temperature data. The goal is to improve computational efficiency. Examples use the field data from a gas well in Marcellus shale formation to illustrate the feasibility of quantitative interpretation of temperature measurement for fracture diagnosis. The forward model uses the fast marching method. The forward simulation is order-of-magnitude faster than even the semi-analytical model, which is the essential contribution to apply the method in the field case successfully. The inversion procedure starts with a sensitivity study to select the inversion parameters among various parameters such as fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, and determine the impact of their uncertainty on inversion. The inversion model uses the initial analysis on temperature gradient to identify the zones with significant temperature changes for interpretation and eliminates the rest of the data from interpretation. Thus, we obtain a prior estimation of the selected inversion parameters, which will be used as an initial guess of the inversion process. This prior estimation saves significant computation. The inversion is performed fracture by fracture either using parallel computing or sequential computing based on the sensor locations. We first show a synthetic example with multiple fractures to illustrate the approach, test the procedure accuracy and computation speed. The primary inversion parameter is flow rate, and either fracture length or fracture conductivity, with all other parameters as an additional constraint. With an adequate initial guess, the inverted parameters match the reference \"true value\" properly. The inversion process converges with limited iterations for each fracture. The operation time highlights the advantages of the inversion model. The guided initial guess ensures the gradient inversion method converge and avoid local minimization. Finally, a field application is performed using this inversion model and shows encouraging results. The results of the paper illustrate the feasibility and procedure of using temperature date to diagnose multistage fracture treatment. The proposed inversion model is fast and reliable which provides a promising tool that can be used to interpret downhole temperature data quantitatively. "

                    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing is a commonly used stimulation technique for oil and gas wells. In carbonate reservoirs, acid is injected into the formation to dissolve carbonate rock and create highly permeable channels called wormholes. For a constant volume of acid injection, different injection rates create wormholes with different lengths. The injection rate that creates the deepest wormhole is called the optimal acid-injection rate. Optimal injection rate is determined in laboratory experiments by measuring the pore volumes to breakthrough (i.e., the volume of acid injected in a coreflood for the wormhole to reach the exit end of the core, normalized by the initial pore volume of the core). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used for carbonate acidizing treatments. The reaction between HCl and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) creates carbon dioxide (CO2). At laboratory conditions, 1,000-psi backpressure is commonly used for acidizing experiments to keep CO2 in solution. However, on the basis of the solubility of CO2 in water, 1,000 psi may not be enough to keep CO2 in solution. In such a case, undissolved CO2 can be present as a gaseous phase in the system. Because the properties of CO2 change with pressure and temperature, the evolution of CO2 and its effect on wormhole-propagation efficiency need to be investigated to evaluate optimal acid-injection conditions accurately. In this study, coreflooding experiments are conducted to examine the effects of evolved CO2 on wormholing behavior. The experiments are conducted at both room temperature and an elevated temperature. Different backpressures from 500 to 3,000 psi are applied in the experiments. The Buijse and Glasbergen (2005) model is used for curve fitting to obtain the optimal acid flux and optimal pore volume to breakthrough for each experiment. Computed-tomography (CT) -scan images are taken for each core sample after acid injection to evaluate the structures of the wormholes. The test results show that the effect of CO2 on wormholing depends on the temperature, pressure, and injection rate. For low injection rate, CO2 present as a gaseous phase slows wormhole-propagation efficiency dramatically, and enlarged wormhole diameter is observed. At injection rates greater than the optimal rate, the effect of CO2 is less pronounced, particularly at higher temperatures. "

                    "abstract": "Summary Downhole temperature measured by distributed-temperature sensors (DTSs) shows distinct response to injection and shut-in during multistage fracture treatments in horizontal wells. A thermal model predicting temperature distribution along the wellbore is essential to use the DTS technology to quantitatively diagnose fracture treatments. With inversion, the model can be used to translate downhole-temperature measurement to downhole flow distribution, and therefore to estimate fracture efficiency. In this paper, we present a thermal/flow model that predicts temperature distribution in a system that contains reservoir, wellbore, and fractures during fracture propagation and after well shut-in. We coupled a wellbore-flow model with a simple fracture-propagation model to predict fracture half-length and fluid distribution. For a single-stage fracture treatment, a transient wellbore thermal model is coupled with the fracture and formation thermal models, which are derived from the energy-conservation equations. A sequential simulation method is then applied for multistage fracture treatments by considering the treatment schedule. The full model has three modes: no fracture, fracture propagation, and warm back for shut-in. The full model is used to simulate the stage that is under fracturing. Once the fracture pumping is finished, warm back of the entrained fracture fluid during shut-in periods is simulated by removing the convection term and implementing the corresponding boundary conditions. Numerical solutions are necessary for time-dependent fluid loss and complex nonlinear heat exchange. Mass- and energy-conservation equations are solved by use of the fully implicit finite-difference approach for the conjoint gridding system. The results of the fracture and formation model are verified by analytical solutions for simplified cases. This paper provides synthetic case studies in a low-permeability reservoir by use of the integrated model. The influences of fluid distribution, fluid loss caused by natural and induced fractures, DTS-deployment locations, and reservoir-heat-transfer parameters on temperature behavior are investigated. At the creation and propagation of fractures, injection flow rate (convection) plays an important role on fracture propagation and leakoff front movements. Heat conduction is the dominant mechanism governing temperature response during shut-in. By use of the algorithm for single-stage treatment, a work flow for multistage fracture simulation is created by performing a single-stage stimulation, shutting in the stage, and moving to the next stage along the wellbore. For a shale reservoir, the time frame to reach thermal equilibrium is on the order of weeks, and this gives the possibility to identify the flow-rate distribution from temperature measurements. Sensitivity of fluid distribution, fluid loss, DTS fiber-cable locations for different completion methods, and reservoir parameters is examined, which helps us to understand temperature behavior for fracture diagnosis by use of DTS data during stimulation operations. The methodology developed in this work can be a complementary component to a model that predicts temperature behavior during production to provide better boundary conditions, and it can also be a standalone tool to analyze fracturing-fluid distribution.

                    "abstract": "It has been well-understood that there exists an optimal condition in matrix acidizing in carbonate formations. When a treatment is not pumped at the optimal conditions, the efficiency of the stimulation suffers. A cost-effective procedure for maximizing matrix acidizing treatment results in carbonates is proposed. This procedure includes a systematic approach to altering the acid schedule, pump schedule and the placement technique. The procedure is particularly important for high temperature or long treatment intervals where achieving optimal injection rate is difficult. Injecting acid below the optimal injection rate in matrix acidizing of carbonates can negatively impact productivity/injectivity by significantly limiting the final skin reduction. To design a treatment that creates dominant wormholes to improve well performance, the optimal pumping rate must first be determined based on the field conditions which can be scaled up from laboratory core flood data. For cases where the optimal injection rate cannot be achieved because of the limitation of pumping equipment, this paper proposes a counter-intuitive procedure for altering the treatment design. There are means to reduce optimal injection rate for a treatment, such as changing acid concentration, acid type or additives. Reducing acid strength can lead to a slower reaction rate and deeper wormhole penetration. There is however a limit since reducing the acid strength will not only reduce the optimal interstitial velocity but also increase the acid volumes required for breakthrough because of lower acid dissolving power. If the optimal pumping rate cannot be sufficiently reduced, then the placement techniques must be modified to facilitate higher injection rates. Furthermore, the pump schedule must also consider heterogeneity and this may require the use of multiple stages. Using published core flood data along with hypothetical well designs, various acid treatments have been simulated, and the results are presented in terms of skin factor along the well length for each injection strategy. The study demonstrates the application of the proposed procedure. The results of the study showed that in cases where the pumping rate is less than optimal, simulation results show less than optimal skin factors are predicted. When pumping at low rates, using the highest concentration of acid does not necessarily result in the most efficient wormhole creation and propagation. There is a clear limit to which reducing acid strength can benefit the degree of penetration for a given injection rate. The proposed procedure is a practical means of creating a cost effective acidizing design that not only removes formation damage but creates deep dominant wormholes that minimize the skin factor. "

                    "abstract": "The optimum design of matrix acidizing operations in carbonate reservoirs is a discussion in progress. Although there are several models available to the industry for predicting wormhole propagation, most of them are not practical enough to be used in real treatment designs, or were developed to represent core flood data and cannot be simply scaled up to represent wormhole formation in complex well geometries. This problem is addressed by Furui's wormhole propagation model, which is a modification of Buijse and Glasbergen empirical correlation including a scale up procedure to represent field carbonate acidizing operations using laboratory core flood data. It is a practical engineering tool that can be used for treatment designs in horizontal wells, including barefoot and perforation-cluster completions in fairly isotropic and homogeneous reservoirs. In this work an analysis of Furui's model is performed, including the effect of anisotropy in the carbonate reservoir. The analysis includes both radial or elliptical wormhole propagation that forms from an openhole completion and the spherical or ellipsoidal wormhole propagation that emerges from each perforation in a perforation-cluster completion that makes use of a limited-entry technique for achieving good acid placement. The development is made using extensive 3D numerical simulations with a two-scale continuum model and finite volumes method to represent the dissolution of the porous medium. The numerical model is tuned to represent real results through matching experimental core flood data and dissolution patterns. Some conclusions are obtained regarding both isotropic and anisotropic formations. In isotropic formations with radial propagation of wormholes, simulations indicate that a number from four to six wormholes propagate radially in each plane. When the propagation is spherical, simulations result in a number from 16 to 24 wormholes propagating spherically from the point of acid injection. In anisotropic formations, the radial stimulated zone might become an elliptic stimulated zone, depending on the acid injection rate and the permeability heterogeneity magnitude. The major axis of the elliptic stimulated zone coincides with the direction of higher permeability and longer permeability correlation length, and it is longer for larger acid injection rates. Analogously, the spherical wormholes propagation pattern might become an ellipsoidal stimulated zone in anisotropic formations. "

                    "abstract": "Optimal acid-injection rate is critical information for carbonate-matrix-acidizing design. This rate is currently obtained through fitting acidizing-coreflood experimental results. A model is needed to predict optimal acid-injection rates for various reservoir conditions. A wormhole forms when larger pores grow in the cross-sectional area at a rate that greatly exceeds the growth rate of smaller pores caused by surface reaction. This happens when the pore growth follows a particular mechanism, which is discussed in this paper. We have developed a model to predict wormhole-growth behavior. The model uses the mode size in a pore-size distribution--the pore size that appears most frequently in the distribution--to predict the growth of the pore. By controlling the acid velocity inside of it, we can make this particular pore grow much faster than other smaller pores, thus reaching the most-favorable condition for wormholing. This also results in a balance between overall acid/rock reaction and acid flow. With the introduction of a porous-medium model, the acid velocity in the mode-size pore is scaled up to the interstitial velocity at the wormhole tip. This interstitial velocity at the wormhole tip controls the wormhole propagation. The optimal acid-injection rates are then calculated by use of semiempirical flow correlations for different flow geometries. The optimal injection rate depends on the rock lithology, acid concentration, temperature, and rock-pore-size distribution. All these factors are accounted for in this model. The model can predict the optimal rates of acidizing-coreflood experiments correctly, compared with our acidizing-coreflood experimental results. In addition, on the basis of our model, it is also found that at optimal conditions, the wormhole-propagation velocity is linearly proportional to the acid-diffusion coefficient for a diffusion-limited reaction. This is proved both experimentally and theoretically in this study. Because there is no flow-geometry constraint while developing this model, it can be applied to field scales. Applications are presented in this paper. "

The comprehensive study investigated the conductivity behaviors of four shale plays, the Barnett, Fayetteville, Marcellus and Eagle Ford, by testing fracture conductivity as a function of closure stress using collected outcrop rock samples. Conductivity of fractured rock samples are measured using a modified API RP 61 procedure. In addition to conductivity, a plethora of rock properties such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, Brinell hardness, rock brittleness, and mineralogy are measured corresponding to each conductivity test sample. Other parameters considered in this study include proppant mesh size, proppant concentration, and fracture topography to see the resulting impact on conductivity. With all measurements, a multivariate analysis is carried out with the goal of seeking a correlation between fracture conductivity and the influential rock properties and treatment parameters. All results are cross-compared to identify similarities and differences between formations as well as the most important parameters influencing fracture conductivity relative to each formation. The results indicate a positive trend between both Brinell hardness and Young's Modulus with fracture conductivity. Increased fracture face surface roughness is also found to have an overall decrease in conductivity in propped fractures. The influential parameters are different for different shale plays. Some parameters are more important in one formation but less influential in others. The observations are integrated into a preliminary simple correlation for conductivity behavior. The observations and results from this study clarify the similarity and differences in varying shale plays. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture conductivity in shale formations can be greatly reduced due to water-rock interactions. The mechanisms of water damage to fracture conductivity include clay swelling, surface softening, excessive proppant embedment, and fines migration due to fracture surface spalling and failed proppant particles. Fracture conductivity is influenced by closure stress, bulk and surface rock mechanical properties, fracture surface topography, fracture surface elemental composition, rock mineralogy, proppant type and concentration, among other factors. This paper presents a study considering several of the aforementioned factors, centered primarily on saline water induced fracture conductivity impairment of the Eagle Ford shale formation and its five vertical lithostratigraphic units. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of flowback water on fracture conductivity for Eagle Ford shale samples. The majority of test samples were obtained from an outcrop located in Antonio Creek, Terrell County, Texas; while the remaining samples were obtained from downhole core provided by an industry partner. Saline water with a similar chemical composition to the typical field flowback water was utilized. Fracture conductivity measurements were conducted in three stages. In the first stage, dry nitrogen was flowed to ascertain the undamaged initial fracture conductivity. In the second stage, the saline solution was injected into the fracture until steady state behavior was observed. In the third and final stage, dry nitrogen was once again flowed to quantify the recovered fracture conductivity. Reported mechanical properties from the same outcrop rock samples, consisting of Poisson's ratio and the Brinell hardness number, were considered in this study. Additionally, reported mineralogy obtained using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) microscopy was taken into consideration. The elemental composition along the fracture surface was obtained using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy, and fracture surface topography was obtained using a laser surface scanner and profilometer. Results support findings that bulk and surface mechanical properties influence fracture conductivity, as well as surface topography and related attributes such as fracture surface area. Furthermore, the bulk mineralogical composition of the rock and the elemental composition of the rock fracture surface have a significant impact on fracture conductivity when flowing saline water in order to simulate flowback. Clay content was observed to directly influence fracture conductivity. The results of this study show a loss of fracture conductivity for Eagle Ford formation ranging from approximately 4 to 25 % after flowing saline water, when compared to the initial conductivity measured by flowing dry nitrogen before saline water exposure. This is not a large loss in conductivity due to water damage, and suggests that water damage may not be the major cause of the large early decline rates observed in most Eagle Ford shale producing wells.

                    "abstract": "Downhole-temperature measurement is one of the solutions to understanding downhole-flow conditions, especially in complex well/reservoir domains such as multistage-fractured horizontal wells. In the past, models and methodologies have been developed for fracture diagnosis for multiple-stage-fractured horizontal wells. They are based either on a semianalytical approach for simplicity or on reservoir simulation for generality. The challenges are that semianalytical models are not robust enough to describe complex fracture systems, whereas numerical simulation is computationally expensive and impractical for inversion. To develop a comprehensive approach to translate temperature to flow profile, we adopted the fast marching method (FMM) in simulating both heat transfer and the velocity/pressure field in the interested domain (heterogeneous reservoir with multiple-fractured horizontal wells). FMM is a new approach that is efficient in front tracking. Previous studies show a significant success in the investigation of pressure-depletion behavior and shale-gas production-history match. By the nature of heat transfer in porous media, the thermal-front propagation would lag behind pressure, and the noticeable temperature change in the reservoir only happens near hydraulic/natural fractures. FMM can be used to efficiently track the heat front that is associated with the flow field. In this study, we solve the thermal model in porous media by transforming the general energy-balance equation into a 1D equation, with the diffusive time of flight (DTOF) as the spatial coordinate system. Besides the diffusive heat conduction, the convection, Joule-Thomson effect, and viscous dissipation are considered in the model. The inner boundary of the model is carefully handled, and the drainage volume of each fracture is calculated to identify different inflow temperature related to flow rate at perforation locations. The model was validated by the finite-difference approach. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the application of the new method. The approach can be used to quantitatively interpret temperature measurements to fracture profiles in horizontal wells. "

                    "abstract": "Downhole temperature data that are measured by production logging tools (PLTs) or fiber-optic distributed-temperature sensors are used frequently today to diagnose multistage fracture treatments in horizontal or highly deviated wells. These temperature data, measured at the wellbore during fracturing and post-fracture, provide important transient-flow information that helps engineers understand the process of fracturing and the performance of fractured wells, to optimize fracture design. The interpretation models developed to translate temperature data to flow conditions can be fully numerical simulations or analytical/semianalytical approaches. With reasonable assumptions, analytical/semianalytical models are more suitable for real-time field applications. This paper presents the application of a coupled semianalytical fracture model and a wellbore model to predict temperature and pressure behavior in multiple-fracture horizontal wells during production. The thermal model calculated the heat transfer in the fracture/reservoir/wellbore system, considering subtle temperature changes caused by the Joule-Thomson cooling effects. The results showed that transient temperature behavior is sensitive enough to estimate the fracture-initiation points, the number of created fractures, and the flow profile along the wellbore. We discuss the characteristics of transient temperature behaviors and flow-rate distribution along a fractured horizontal wellbore. The temperature decreases when the gas entering the wellbore is strong at the toe and weak toward the heel and when the fractures are more evenly created along the wellbore because of the fluid mixture inside the wellbore. Two field cases are presented to illustrate the application of the temperature model to understand the fracture/flow distribution. The estimation of flow-rate distribution from the temperature model is compared with the interpretation of flow by PLTs. Although this is a single-phase gas model, we can identify the water sump at certain locations by identifying fast temperature recovery to geothermal value. Flow distribution from the temperature model presents a consistent trend with PLT measurement. It is more sensitive to the fluid entries (fracture locations) and less sensitive to the influence of the flow pattern inside the wellbore when compared with PLTs. This work shows that temperature data can identify fracture locations (fluid-entry points) and estimate flow-rate distribution. Because of the complexity of flow in a multistage, fractured horizontal well, any measurement alone would not be able to provide clear description of the created fracture system. A combination of temperature data with other diagnostic methods will provide a better description of the production performance of such a well. "

The models are derived from the analysis of experiments relating dynamic fracture conductivity to flowback rate, reservoir temperature, polymer loading, presence of breaker, closure stress, and proppant concentration. The first model is purely empirical, and it is modeled after fracture-conductivity studies conducted in previous work. The experimental design and planning table were derived from fractional-factorial designs. This meant that we could uniquely quantify the effect of all the dependent variables and also ensure that the factors are not correlated. We tested the empirical model for adequacy--that is, ensuring the model residuals are normally distributed with no obvious trend and approximately constant variance. Because empirical models are generally constrained by the data on which they are built, we developed a semiempirical model dependent on dimensional analysis and nonlinear regression. Dimensionless products from the dimensional analysis procedure form the backbone of this semiempirical model. We used subset-regression analysis to determine the optimal regression model and found that model was adequate. We also found two dimensionless groups and used them to develop the semiempirical model. We thereafter corrected the semiempirical model for the effect of temperature. Both the purely empirical model and the semiempirical model match experimental data with reasonable accuracy. These models can be used as a first approximation for the short-term fracture conductivity of field hydraulic fractures. We also present methodology by which engineers can develop empirical models, assess uncertainty, and test for regression-model adequacy given noisy data. "

Despite the abundance of carbonate formations (60% of conventional reserves), there is little consensus on the effect of physical formation properties related to acidizing efficiency. This study characterizes the pore-size distribution for different carbonates and evaluates how the optimum pore volume to breakthrough, PVbt,opt, and the optimal interstitial flux, vi,opt, are related to various physical properties of the rock. The pore-size distributions evaluated in this study are constructed with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) imaging, a non-invasive X-Ray imaging technique pioneered in the medical field. Micro-CT is improved over medical CT because it can scan at higher energies and higher resolution. In this work, resolution for scanned samples range from 5-8 μm/voxel and sample sizes are approximately 1cm3. Image processing is applied to the raw CT data to segment pore space from the surrounding matrix. Object counter software is used to identify and measure individual pores, which can then be organized into a pore-size distribution. Statistical parameters are calculated by fitting a lognormal distribution function to each sample's pore-size distribution. We find that the shape of the pore-size distribution is influenced by the type of carbonate rock and that fitting the distribution yields better correlations to optimum acidizing parameters than permeability or porosity alone.

Facies A and B are known as the lower Eagle Ford shale, whereas facies C, D and E are known as the upper Eagle Ford shale. Facies E underlies the Austin chalk. Conductivity samples in three orientations and core plugs in two orientations were obtained from outcrops samples. The orientations represent vertical fractures with flow in the horizontal direction (X0 orientation) or flow in the vertical direction (X90 orientation), and horizontal fractures with horizontal flow (Z orientation). Short term fracture conductivity experiments were performed using a modified API conductivity cell at room temperature. Unpropped and propped conductivities were measured with gas flow. Low proppant concentration was used in order to simulate a slick-water treatment. Proppants of various sizes were placed manually on a rough fracture face. The fracture faces were scanned with a surface profilometer to calculate the fracture roughness. Compressive triaxial tests were performed on the core plugs in order to determine the elastic rock properties such as Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio. Additionally, Brinell hardness tests were completed to determine the resistance to embedment. Mineral composition was acquired by X-ray Diffraction analysis. The obtained fracture conductivities were compared to the fracture face roughness, elastic mechanical properties, Brinell hardness and mineralogy of the samples. It was found that propped and unpropped conductivities decline exponentially with closure stress. Propped conductivity was found to be dominated by proppant characteristics. Conductivity is positively related to rock brittleness and inversely related to Poisson's ratio. For the samples cut perpendicular to the bedding, no significant difference was found for between horizontal flow (X0) and vertical flow (X90). The parallel-bedding samples (Z) in general have lower conductivity compared with the perpendicular-bedding (both X0 and X90). Within facies B, samples with flow on the bedding plane (Z) were found to have the lowest conductivity. The findings of this study provide useful information to understand the outcomes of fracture stimulation in Eagle Ford, and therefore to assist fracture treatment design. "

                    "abstract": "Acid jetting, as a well stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, has shown optimistic results in the production enhancement of some extended reach horizontal wells. It was used initially to promote damage removal along a wellbore via multiple strategically-located injection nozzles. It has the potential to place the injecting fluid at the locations that need stimulation. Jetting may also enhance wormhole propagation compared with conventional matrix acidizing. These hypotheses are currently being investigated to improve the design for more efficient stimulation treatments. We have conducted an experimental study to investigate the effect of jetting on wormhole efficiency. The jetting experiments are conducted at a constant pressure with linear core-flood tests, where a stand-off distance is maintained between the injection nozzle tip and the core. At low-velocity acid injection, jetting effectively removes mud filter-cake by mechanical actions. Jetting also creates wormholes in carbonate cores. The combination of mechanical and chemical reactions stimulates carbonate rocks better than matrix acidizing without the jetting nozzle. When the jetting velocity increases, the dissolution pattern changes. An isolated locally compact dissolution results in a cavity at the entries of core samples by jetting, followed by a wormhole structure. With the known dissolution pattern, sensitivity studies are carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the experimental outcome. We used Indiana and Winterset limestone rocks in the experiments. 15% HCl (by weight) at ambient temperature was used and the core dimensions were 4 inches in diameter and 16 inches in length. Various combinations of acid jetting velocities and acid fluxes were considered. The Winterset limestone cores are more heterogeneous, with higher porosity and lower permeability than the Indiana limestone cores. From the experimental results, the results of acid jetting from the two different rock samples are compared. The experimental results indicate that acid jetting follows the same trend as matrix acidizing regarding wormhole propagation once cavities are created. Jetting velocity and acid flux are the critical parameters in jetting design for optimal stimulation results. Acid jetting tends to create different dissolution patterns for Indiana limestone and Winterset limestone cores. The observations from this work highlight the importance of understanding the dynamic chemical process of jetting in the design of successful acid stimulation jobs. "

The target formation features extreme closure stress and low permeability at a depth of 5000-7000 meters. The efficiency of acid fracturing is challenged by the severe condition of the formation. The laboratory experiments were performed using the core samples from three wells from the productive interval of the target reservoir. The acid fracturing treatment conditions that have been used in the field were simulated during the laboratory experiments. The fracture conductivity was measured for un-propped, acid-etched, and propped fractures at different closure stresses using an apparatus consisting of a modified API conductivity cell and a load frame The fracture face surface of the intact and acidized core samples was scanned with a profilometer to characterize the change in surface profile to calculate the volume of dissolved rock caused by acid etching, and the initial fracture conductivity under zero closure stress. Conductivity decline as a function of closure stress was recorded and examined during the study. The results of the comparative study on fracture conductivities showed that the final propped fracture conductivity was higher than the acid fracture conductivity for all of the core samples. Also, the rate of conductivity decline with increasing closure stress was lower for the propped fracture conductivity compared to the acid fracture conductivity. The conclusion was made that the propped hydraulic fractures would retain a greater conductivity under the formation closure stress compared to the acid fractures. Hence, the hydraulic fracturing with proppant would be a more effective stimulation treatment compared to the acid fracturing for improving the wells productivity for the studied reservoir. "

                    "abstract": "Shale fracture conductivity can be reduced significantly by shale/water interactions. Factors that may influence shale fracture conductivity include shale mineralogy, proppant embedment, shale-fines migration, proppant-fines migration, brine concentration, longer-term stress application, and residual water in the fracture. The study of excessive proppant embedment has been reported in our previous work (Zhang et al. 2014a). This paper presents the studies of the remainder of these factors. Laboratory experiments were run to understand each of these factors. To study the effect of rock mineralogy, recovered fracture conductivities after water damage were measured for Barnett shale, Eagle Ford shale, and Berea sandstone. During conductivity measurements, water-flow directions were switched to study the effect of shale-fines migration. The size of shale fines was measured by microscopic imaging techniques, and scanning-electron-microscope observations were also presented. Proppant-fines migration was examined by placing two colors of sand on each half of the fracture surface, and then a microscope was used to identify the migrated crushed sands of one sand color mixed in with the other sand color. Fresh water and 2% KCl were injected to study the effect of brine concentration. After water injection, the proppant pack was either fully dried or kept wet to investigate the damage caused by residual water. Results showed that clay content determines the fracture-conductivity damage caused by water. Fines generated from the shale fracture because of fracture-face spalling, slope instability, and clay dispersion can migrate inside the fracture and are responsible for 12 to 20% of the conductivity reduction. There is no evidence of crushed-proppant-particle migration in this study. Longer-term stress application accounts for a 20% reduction of the fracture conductivity. In the Barnett shale tests, further conductivity damage caused by fresh water after brine injection is not significant when initial conductivities are greater than 65 md-ft. Removal of the residual water from the fracture by evaporation helps to recover the fracture conductivity to a small extent. A theoretical model of propped-fracture conductivity was extended to include the effects of water damage on fracture conductivity. An empirical correlation for the damage effects in the Barnett shale was implemented in this model. "

                    "abstract": "Acid fracturing stimulation can be an effective means to improve well performance in carbonate formations. In general, a treatment consists of multiple stage injections alternating between acid and non-reacting fluid to better place acid, and therefore, to create sustainable conductivity for enhanced well productivity. Selecting appropriate fluid systems is critical in success of acid fracturing. To optimize acid fracturing design, an integrated approach is needed to model the fluid behavior inside of the fracture, the conductivity after fracturing, and the productivity of fractured wells. The integrated approach includes an acid transport model and a fracture propagation model. Theoretical models were developed to obtain the conductivity distribution and acid penetration distance inside fractures. Continuity and momentum balance equations are solved in three-dimensional space for pressure and velocity profiles. Once the velocity profile is generated, the acid balance equation can be solved for the acid concentration profile. Obtaining a concentration profile helps in calculating the amount of rock etched through diffusion and convection. Conductivity distribution is calculated using a correlation where statistical parameters are used to account for fracture heterogeneity. Finally, a reservoir simulator is used to predict the production performance from acid fractured wells. Straight, emulsified, and gelled acid systems are examined using the integrated approach to capture the effect of each on fracture conductivity and acid penetration distance. Optimizing these two parameters will improve the production performance significantly. Straight acid reacts aggressively with carbonate formations and leaks off significantly more near the entrance of the fracture when compared with the other two acid systems. The apparent viscosities of gelled or emulsified acids are substantially higher than that of straight acid, and the diffusion coefficients of these viscous fluids are substantially lower than that of straight acid. These properties result in deeper penetration down the fracture with gelled or emulsified acids, but also less fracture etching by acid near the well. The tradeoff between deeper penetration with viscosified acid systems versus more near well etching with less viscous systems means that the acid formulation can be optimized depending primarily on the formation permeability. Production analysis of these three acid systems suggests that emulsified acid is better used in tight formations. Gelled acid, on the other hand, results in the highest production rate when used in relatively high to medium permeability formations. Straight acid is the preferred system only when short, highly conductive fractures are desired. "

                    "abstract": "Multi-stage acid fracturing in a tight carbonate formation can be an alternative to propped fracturing as a relatively cost-effective completion treatment. However the success of the treatment depends on many factors as to whether enough conductivity by acid etching has been created, and weather the selected chemical treatment has worked well in-situ under the specific geologic environment. Thus, observation and evaluation of past practice is important to develop further optimal stimulation procedures. In this paper, an integrated methodology to conduct performance evaluation of multi-stage acid fracturing treatment in a horizontal well is presented. The method is applied to a field case in Tarim Basin in China. The integrated procedure starts with obtaining closure pressure and the formation breakdown pressure. Bottomhole treating pressure is then estimated from surface treating pressure in cases if it is not measured directly. A treatment pressure history match is then conducted to estimate the fracture geometry using commercial software. A 3-D acid fracture conductivity profile is generated using the in-house acid fracture simulator. Then using the reservoir face pressure and the acid fracture conductivity profile obtained by the acid fracture simulator, the cross-sectional flowing area created by acid fracturing fluid is estimated using pressure transient analysis. Evolution of fracture extension and acid etching during the stimulation is calculated assuming a bilinear flow regime. After production starts, a linear flow diagnostic approach provides the cross-sectional area flowing that has the flow from the matrix. This enables us to compare flowing cross-sectional area with induced area by the stimulation, which is defined as treatment efficiency. A field application based on the proposed procedure shows the effectiveness of the approach. The integrated approach provides engineers with additional information as to whether the designed acid fracturing has been performed appropriately under high closure stress field. It is eventually helpful to discuss past practice and improve candidate selectivity in a company decision making process. "

                    "abstract": "Multi-stage hydraulic fracturing is the key to the success of many shale gas and shale oil reservoirs. The main objective of hydraulic fracturing in shale is to create fracture networks with sufficient fracture conductivity. Due to the variation in shale mineralogical and mechanical properties, fracture conductivity damage mechanisms in shale formations are complex. Standard fracture conductivity measurement procedures developed for fractures with high proppant concentration had to be modified to measure the conductivity in fractures with low proppant concentration. Water-based fracturing fluids can interact with the clay minerals in shale and eventually impact shale fracture conductivity. All these challenges require more experimental studies to improve our understanding of realistic fracture conductivity in shale formations. The aims of this work were to design an experimental framework to measure fracture conductivity created by low concentration proppants and to investigate the mechanisms of conductivity damage by water. We first presented the laboratory procedures and experimental design that can accurately measure fracture conductivity of shale fractures at low concentrations of proppants. Then we measured the undamaged shale fracture conductivity by dry nitrogen. Water with similar flowback water compositions was injected to simulate the damage process followed by secondary gas flow to measure the recovered fracture conductivity after the water damage. This study shows that the developed laboratory procedures can be utilized to reproducibly measure shale fracture conductivity by both gas and liquid. The conductivity measurement of propped fractures by small size proppants at low concentrations requires strict control on gas flow bypassing the fracture both parallel and perpendicular to the fracture length direction. Shale fracture surface softening is identified as the dominant cause for the significant conductivity reduction after water flow. "

                    "abstract": "Shale fracture conductivity plays a critical role in determining the long term production of shale wells. High fracture conductivity is achieved by pumping more proppants and minimizing conductivity damage by fracturing fluid. Currently, fracture conductivity is either measured in laboratory following ISO 13503-5 or calculated using correlations derived from extensive laboratory tests by regression analysis. There is a need for a handy and practical tool to calculate shale fracture conductivity reflecting realistic fracturing designs. This paper presents a new correlation to calculate shale fracture conductivity that considers proppant properties, fracture design variables and formation mechanical properties. This correlation is based on the population balance equation for size reduction. It utilizes the population balance concept to predict the crushed proppant size distribution under increasing closure stress. Numerical solution of the integro-differential equation is validated by comparing the computed results with the measured data. The crushed grain size distribution determines the permeability of the sand pack. Fracture width is calculated separately by considering proppant embedment and proppant grain rearrangement. Fracture conductivity is then calculated and compared with laboratory measured conductivity. Finally, the effect of water damage to shale fracture conductivity is considered by bringing in a new modification term. Results show that the population balance equation can reasonably predict the crushed proppant size reduction by properly choosing the selection equation and breakage equation. The calculated shale fracture conductivity can match with the measured fracture conductivity using the Barnett Shale. An exponential expression can be used to account for the water damage effect in the Barnett Shale. "

                    "abstract": "Production of hydrocarbons from low-permeability shale reservoirs has become economically feasible thanks to advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Together, these two techniques help to create a fracture network, which act as fluid conduits from the reservoir to the wellbore. The efficacy of a fracturing treatment can be determined through fracture conductivity analysis. Fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width, and describes both how much and how easily fluid can flow through fractures. It is therefore directly related to well performance. The goal of this work is to explore fracture conductivity of Marcellus shale samples fractured in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The Marcellus shale, located primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, and Maryland, is the largest gas-bearing shale formation in North America, and its development has significant implications on regional economies, the energy infrastructure of northeast United States, and the availability of petrochemical plant feedstock. In this work, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the propped fracture conductivity of 23 different outcropsamples from Elimsport and Allenwood, Pennyslvania. Before conductivity measurements were taken, the pedigree of samples was verified through XRD analysis, elastic rock properties were measured and compared against literature values, and fracture surface contours were mapped and measured. Fracture conductivity of both horizontally and vertically-fracture samples was determined by measuring the pressure drop of nitrogen gas through a modified API conductivity cell. Results show that fracture conductivity varies as a function of fracture orientation only when anisotropy of the rock's mechanical properties is pronounced. It is hypothesized that the anisotropy of Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio play a significant role in fracture mechanics, and therefore in the width of hydraulically-induced fractures. Ultimately, the experiments conducted as part of this work show that fracture conductivity trends are strongly tied to both proppant concentration and the rock mechanical properties. "

                    "abstract": "Downhole temperature measurements is one of the solutions to understand downhole flow conditions, especially in complex well/reservoir domains such as multi-stage fractured horizontal wells. In the past, models and methodologies have been developed for fracture diagnosis for multiple-stage fractured horizontal wells. They are based on either semi-analytical approach for simplicity or reservoir simulation for generality. The challenges are that semi-analytical models are not robust enough to describe complex fracture systems, while numerical simulation is computationally expensive and impractical for routine inversion. To develop a comprehensive approach to translate temperature to flow profile, we adopted Fast Marching Method in simulating both heat transfer and velocity/pressure field in the domain of interest (heterogeneous reservoir with multiple fractured horizontal wells). Fast Marching Method (FMM) is a relatively new approach which is efficient in front tracking. Previous studies show a significant success in the investigation of pressure depletion behavior and shale gas production history match. By the nature of heat transfer in porous media, the thermal front propagation would lag behind pressure and the noticeable temperature change in reservoir only happens near hydraulic/natural fractures. FMM can be used to efficiently track the heat front that is associated with flow field. In this study, we solve the thermal model in porous media by transforming the general energy balance equation into a 1-D equation with a ‘diffusive time of flight’ as the spatial coordinate system. Besides the diffusive heatpropagation, Joule-Thomson effect and viscous dissipation are also considered in the model. The inner boundary of the model is carefully handled and the drainage volume of each fracture is calculated to identify different inflow temperature related to flow rate at perforation locations. The model was validated by a finite difference approach. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate the application of the new method. The approach can be used to quantitatively interpret temperature measurements to fracture profiles in horizontal wells. "

This paper presents a systematic study to clarify the effect of fracture topographic features on acid fracture conductivity. The importance is that most of the industry correlations to predict acid fracture conductivity are based on experimental measurements of acid conductivity at laboratory scale. We conducted acid injection tests with fractured cores from the Austin Chalk and San Andres dolomite formations to investigate the effect of injection temperature, pumping time and acid type on fracture conductivity. We also studied the influence of the core fracture surface texture before the injection of acid. Two types of fracture surface textures were used—rough surface and smooth surface—to quantify the effect of surface texture. After the acid injection, we analyzed how conductivity was created by examining the computer-generated profiles of the fracture surfaces. For the smooth fractures, the uneven etching of the rock was responsible for creating roughness on the surfaces and the resulting in conductivity. For rough surfaces, acid conductivity was more related to the deepening of initial features on the sample surface than to creating more roughness. These results suggest that acid conductivity may be created by a combination of both mechanisms, from which deepening may be dominant in homogenous formations. Therefore, it is not correct to disregard the contribution of uneven etching to acid conductivity as suggested by previous publications. Additionally, we found that it is acceptable to perform conductivity tests with either rough or smooth surfaces for soft formations such as the Austin Chalk. The props that kept the fracture open deformed the same for both textures; therefore the conductivity results did not differ significantly. For San Andres dolomite, the conductivity results were different due to the high rock embedment strength of this formation. These results serve as guidelines for performing acid conductivity tests.

The fracturing design involves pumping low viscosity fluid with low proppant concentrations at high pump rate, commonly known as “slick water fracturing”. Direct laboratory measurement of natural and induced fracture conductivity under realistic conditions is needed for reliable well performance analysis and fracturing design optimization. During the course of this study a series of conductivity experiments was completed. The cementing material present on the surface of natural fractures was preserved during the initial unpropped conductivity tests. The induced fractures were artificially created by breaking the shale rock along the bedding plane to account for the effect of irregular fracture surfaces on conductivity. Proppants of various sizes were manually placed between rough fracture surfaces at realistic concentrations. The two sides of the induced fractures were cut in a way to represent either an aligned or a displaced fracture face with a 0.1 inch offset. The effect of proppant partial monolayer was also studied by placing proppants at ultra-low concentrations. Results from the experiments show that unpropped induced fractures can provide a conductive path after removal of free particles and debris generated when cracking the rock. Poorly cemented natural fractures are effective flow paths. Unpropped fracture conductivity depends strongly on the degree of shear displacement, the presence of shale flakes and particles, and the amount of cementing material removed. The propped fracture conductivity is weakly dependent on fracture surface roughness at higher proppant concentrations. Moreover, propped fracture conductivity increases with larger proppant size and higher concentration in the testing range of this study. Results also show that proppant partial monolayers cannot survive higher closure stresses. "

Fracture conductivity can be significantly reduced in shale formations due to severe proppant embedment. In addition, proppant embedment induces shale flakes that migrate and clog fracture networks. A laboratory investigation was performed to understand how excessive proppant embedment caused by the shale–water interaction impairs shale fracture conductivity. The experiments were conducted using Barnett shale samples with representative rock properties. The asperities on the fracture surface were carefully preserved. The damage process was simulated in the laboratory by flowing water through the shale fracture packed with proppants. The water used in the experiments had a similar chemical composition to flowback water in the field. The laboratory results were benchmarked with the results from an experimental study conducted with Berea sandstone samples. Post experimental analysis included microscopic imaging of the fracture surfaces and measurement of the proppant embedment depth. A computational fluid dynamics study was conducted to quantify the conductivity loss due to proppant embedment on a theoretical basis. We developed pore-scale physical models of the proppant pack and calculated the fracture conductivity loss at different proppant embedment depths. The computation was repeated for a variety of proppant layers. The worst case assumed a 40% proppant grain volume embedment. The experimental study showed up to 88% reduction in fracture conductivity after water flow under 4000 psi closure stress. The conductivity loss was due to severe proppant embedment as the shale fracture face was softened after its exposure to water. Direct measurement of embedment depths indicated that for fractures that were exposed to water, the average embedment depth was about 50% of the proppant median diameter, while for fractures that were only exposed to gas, the average embedment depth was just 15% of the proppant median diameter. It was also observed that pore space of the sand grains at the outlet of the fracture was clogged by shale flakes and fragments. The computational fluid dynamics study proved that even a 10% proppant grain volume embedment can cause 45–80% conductivity loss. With the same proppant volume loss due to embedment, the conductivity reduction was less in fractures containing multiple proppant layers than the fracture containing only one layer of proppants. "

Optimal interstitial velocity, vi-opt (the velocity of injected fluid that yields the minimum volume of acid needed to propagate wormholes) can be determined though curve fitting of experimental data. This optimal interstitial velocity coincides with the minimum volume of acid required for wormhole breakthrough, and therefore, the most efficient stimulation design. Optimal interstitial velocity determines the injection rate for a treatment, and the optimal pore volume to breakthroughbreakthrough of pore volume, PVbt-opt, suggests the total volume of acid needed for a treatment. Studies of carbonate matrix acidizing have focused on the role of many parameters, such as acid concentration, acid type, temperature, and core dimensions. However, under the same experimental conditions, different limestone rocks exhibit different optimal conditions. It is important to explore how changes in rock properties, such as permeability and pore structure, can also impact the efficacy of matrix acidizing techniques. In this work, a series of linear core-flood experiments on relative homogenous Indiana limestone and Desert Rose limestone cores were performed at ambient temperature. Cores of 1.5-in. diameter by 8-in. long were acidized using 15% hydrochloric acid. The average permeabilities of the cores tested were 6, 11, 33 and 239 mD with varied porosity. To help understand the effect of permeability on the wormholing process, thin sections were analyzed to characterize the pore structure. Based on experimental results, a detailed explanation of the pore structure and permeability effects on optimal interstitial velocity is presented. The core-flood acidizing results show that at low permeabilities, high permeability rocks exhibit higher optimal interstitial velocities. When permeability of the rock reaches a certain value, the effect of permeability on the optimal injection condition diminishes. The implications and applications of this work are far-reaching; better understanding of optimal acidizing conditions based on the studied rock properties has significant potential economic and operational impact.

Liquid and gas were injected at varying rates into the fracture and into the well. The noise from production was recorded with a hydrophone within the wellbore. Through signal processing, the sound signal collected is transformed into the Fourier domain for insight into the sound spectrum. Experimental results show that frequency and sound intensity varies with the flow condition. The acoustic signal is sensitive to the flow rate and the type of fluid. The peak frequency indicates the phase of the fluid and its magnitude indicates the flow rate. The frequencies for gas production are in a range distinct from those for liquid production and the sound levels are related to the flow rate for both fluids.  Experimental results also show that fracture geometry has an effect on the sound that is generated and sound from production can be used to identify fractures with restricted widths. Background of Acoustic Sensing Technology The idea of using sound for well diagnosis, termed noise logging, started in 1955 through the work of Enright (1955). Noise logging started as a qualitative tool to determine where leaks and fluid movement occur in a well, however, experiments by McKinley et al. (1973) demonstrated that noise logging could be used as a quantitative tool. By recording sound at multiple points within the well a noise log is created. The sound recorded at these multiple points gives an indication of where fluid movement occurs as the sound is created by fluid turbulence. The high amplitude sounds indicate flow through a channel, leaks, flow from perforations or flow past the logging sonde (McKinley et al. 1979). In addition to traditional noise logging tools, sound in wellbores is currently sensed and recorded by Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems. These DAS systems are composed of a fiber optic cable and a laser source. As fluids flow in a wellbore, pressure waves propagate in the fluid and cause strains along the fiber optic cable. A light pulse, at a known rate and intensity, is sent through the fiber optic cable. When this light pulse reaches an area where the cable has been deformed by the acoustic pressure waves, the manner in which this pulse travels through the fiber optic cable changes and generates backscattered waves. Through signal processing, this backscattered light pulse gives an indication of where the acoustic pressure wave deforms the cable and gives a measurement of the sound occurring. This fiber optic cable that can sense acoustic pressure waves are installed along the length of the wellbore. By sending a light pulse through the fiber optic cable and analyzing modulated light pulses, it can determine where sound events occur and determine their intensity. The ability to determine where sound is being generated gives engineers the ability to determine leaks along a wellbore, and detect the locations of production from perforations or fractures, and the locations of injection during hydraulic fracturing; because all of these events and activities generate sound.

                    "abstract": "Fracture conductivity in shale is largely dependent upon the shale rock properties and the formation conditions. This paper aims to explore two different vertical intervals of the Fayetteville Shale, FL2 and FL3, by comparing laboratory fracture conductivity measurements. Fayetteville Shale outcrop cores were artificially fractured, preserving the surface roughness for the conductivity measurements. Controllable parameters, such as proppant size, concentration and type, were kept consistent between the two zones. An initial unpropped experiment was run, followed by two 30:70 mesh propped experiments at 0.03 lb/ft2 and 0.1 lb/ft2 concentrations. The FL2 consistently recorded higher conductivity values than the FL3 at closure stress up to 3,000 psi. Therefore, each zone was evaluated using mineralogical composition, thin-section analysis and surface-roughness scans to identify rock property differences. The FL2 and FL3 rock analysis identified that the two zones are very different. Although the FL2 and FL3 samples used in the conductivity experiments had similar clay content, the FL2 contained more quartz and the FL3 contained more carbonate. Additionally, the FL2 samples were less fissile and had larger surface fragments break along the fracture surface, whereas the FL3 samples broke parallel to the bedding plane and had flaky dust fragments break along the fracture surface. The FL2 had higher conductivity values at low closure stress due to the rearrangement of bulky surface fragments and larger voids created on the surface when fragments were lost. The difference between the FL2 and FL3 conductivity decreases as the concentration of proppant increases because the voids causing unpropped conductivity differences become filled with proppant. Finally, production data was used to confirm laboratory results by providing evidence that wells in the FL3 produce less than the wells in the FL2 formation. Introduction The Fayetteville Shale is an organic-rich shale formation that displays rock and fluid properties similar to the productive Barnett Shale in Texas. The initial completions in the field were nitrogen-assisted fracturing fluids, but were soon altered and by the end of 2006 the primary treatments were similar to Barnett Shale, using slick-water and cross-linked fracturing fluids. Today, slick-water fracturing treatments are the main completion method within the Fayetteville Shale field. Sand is used as the propping agent and 65,000 lbs per perforation cluster is required for most treatment designs (Harpel et al., 2012). Considering the high cost of hydraulic fracturing and large quantities of propping agent used in slick-water fracturing treatment, the selection of a fracturing fluid and propping agent is significant to well cost and production. The selection of both fracturing fluid and proppant depend on the formation. Therefore, understanding how fluids and proppants perform based on rock type, fabric, and mineralogical make-up is invaluable. There have been extensive studies done to better understand realistic fracture conductivity. Cooke (1973) developed a conductivity cell to aid in his study on the effect of high-temperature brine, non-Darcy flow and closure stress on fracture conductivity, concluding that each can reduce fracture conductivity. The conductivity cell used in his study is now the API conductivity cell. Continuing his study, Cooke (1975) investigated the effect of fracturing fluid where he found that the residue from guar polymer can cause conductivity damage and factors such as proppant concentration, residue of the fracturing fluid and porosity of the proppant, determine the conductivity reduction. After Cooke’s initial studies, other works further evaluated other fracture conductivity damage mechanisms such as elevated stress, temperature, fracturing fluid filter cake and fluid additives. "

                    "abstract": "In tight gas reservoirs, horizontal wells have been used to increase reservoir recovery and hydraulic fracturing has been applied to further extend the contact with the reservoir. In the past, many models, analytical or numerical, were developed to describe the flow behavior in horizontal wells with fractures. Source solution is one of analytical/semi-analytical approaches. The source method was advanced from point sources to volumetric source, and pressure change inside fractures was considered in the volumetric source method. We have developed a method that can predict horizontal well performance, and the model can also be applied to fractured horizontal wells. The method solves the problem by superposing a series of slab sources under transient or pseudo-steady state flow conditions. The principle of the method comprises the calculation of semi-analytical response of a rectilinear reservoir with closed outer boundaries. The slab source approach assigns sources a geometry dimension, similar to the volumetric source method; but has the solution similar to the point source method by neglecting the effect of the flow inside the source. When solving the source problem the pressure/flow effect inside source is considered sequentially by superposition principle over multiple sources. The pressure response is integrated over time to provide continuous pressure behavior. Flow effect inside fractures can be studied by dividing the fracture into several segments, and each can be treated as a slab source. The method is validated by comparison with the results of analytical solutions and other commercial software of horizontal wells with uniform flux and infinite conductivity, and fractured wells with uniform flux, finite or infinite conductivity. For multiple fractures in a horizontal well, the method was also compared with some published field data. The method provides an effective tool for horizontal well design and well stimulation design for gas reservoirs. In this paper, we present the details of model development. We use a case study to illustrate how the model can help to optimize wellbore and fracture design by comparing production performances of vertical well, slanted well, horizontal well, and fractured vertical and horizontal wells. The method in this paper is more accurate compared with conventional point-source solution, and can handle the transaction from transient flow to pseudo-steady state flow smoothly. "

                    "abstract": "Predicating the conductivity of acid fracture is not possible using analytical or numerical models due to stochastic nature of acid reaction with rock and complex leak-off behavior of acid. Other alternatives are either empirical correlations or conducting experiments mimicking field treatments. We adopted experimental approach considering scaling down of field conditions to laboratory scale by matching Reynold’s number to represents flow along the facture and acid leak-off through fracture faces, and Pecelt number to represent acid transport to fracture walls. Experiments conducted comprise three stages: dynamic etching, surface characterization of etched cores and conductivity measurement. One objective of this work is to understand mechanism through which conductivity is generated in acid fracturing treatment. Moreover, the effect of initial condition of fracture surfaces on conductivity was investigated to quantify the difference between rough-walled and smooth-walled fractures. Another area of interest is the variation of conductivity along the fracture due to acid spending. In previous works, experiments only represented fracture entrance of actual treatment neglecting that acid is spent along the fracture which affects conductivity. Therefore, to better predicate the performance of an acid fracture, experiments at different acid concentrations representing different positions along the fracture were conducted. We also investigate effect of contact time, acid system type and treatment temperature on conductivity using San Andres Dolomite cores. Preliminary results showed that initial condition of fracture surface has a major influence on fracture conductivity where rough-walled fracture predicted higher conductivity by almost an order of magnitude compared to smooth-walled. And mechanism through which conductivity created is by smoothing peaks and valleys creating surfaces mismatch rather than creating asperities. Furthermore, results showed that acid spending does not necessarily cause a decrease in conductivity from entrance toward the tip of a fracture. Also, cross-linked acid is more effective in terms of dissolving rock and controlling fluid leak-off compared to linear gelled acid. Furthermore, more etching does not always translate to higher conductivity suggesting the existence of optimum contact time. Results obtained provide new insights to better understand and predicate conductivity of acid fracture and suggest guidelines to optimize treatment design. "

Numerous studies have shown that an optimum interstitial velocity (Vi-opt, injection rate over flow area and porosity) exists, which results in the minimum volume of acid required for wormhole propagation and best stimulation results. During the last decade, much progress has been made to determine the factors that affect the optimal conditions in linear coreflood experiments, including the temperature, acid type, and acid concentration. However, little work has focused on the effects of the core dimensions, although a core-size dependence has already been observed. It has been shown that for a fixed core diameter, the Vi-opt increases with increasing core length, but it is not clear if the Vi-opt can be independent of the core length when the core length reaches a certain value. In this work, we conducted a series of coreflood experiments with Indiana limestone cores at room temperature. The cores are selected homogeneous ones, thus to eliminate the effect of heterogeneity. The acid was 15% plain hydrochloric acid. The core lengths range from 4-in. to 10-in. and the core diameters were 1-in., 1.5-in. and 4-in. For the 1-in. and 1.5-in. diameter cores, we found that the optimal conditions changed as core length increased for lengths less than 6 inches. The optimal flux was found to scale with core diameter, as found in other recent studies. In the paper, we show how these results improve scale-up of laboratory acidizing results to the field scale.

To quantify the cost and benefit of a particular acid fracture treatment an engineer must predict the resulting fracture’s conductivity distribution. Current practice is to estimate conductivity distribution utilizing two-dimensional models. Unfortunately, these models can misrepresent the amount of acid etching upon which the conductivity estimation is based. A new modeling tool has been developed to estimate fracture conductivity and is used to evaluate different acid fracture treatment designs. The tool uses three-dimensional flow simulation to resolve acid transport in a fracture. This approach includes resolution of the three-dimensional fluid velocity throughout the fracture, fluid pressure, the acid concentration profile, and the acid-etched width. By using a fine grid in the direction of transport to the fracture surfaces, convective and diffusive transport of acid to the fracture surfaces are modeled. The acid-etched width distribution and other formation information are used to calculate the resulting conductivity distributions for different treatment designs. The output acid-etched width and conductivity distributions for different acid fluid systems, fracture geometries, geologies, and completion designs are calculated. The industry lacks a reliable tool for acid fracture treatment design. The modeling tool presented in this paper attempts to address this problem with rigorous simulation of acid transport and etching in a fracture. The parametric study illustrates the benefits and drawbacks to this approach. "

To predict the conductivity that can be created by acid in a particular formation, the models require information about these formation properties and their spatial variation. This research aims to quantify the small scale heterogeneity by using a geostatistical description to ascertain the distribution of permeability in a carbonate formation. Parameters that quantify the directional correlation and variance of the data are developed. The correlation length and variance parameters are a first step in being able to couple acid transport and rock dissolution models at reservoir scale with a model of fracture conductivity based on channels and roughness features caused by small scale heterogeneity. These geostatistical parameters are developed for a well in the Hugoton Field. Data leading to their derivation are obtained from a combination of well logs and cores. The resulting geostatistical parameters and acid etched width are used to predict acid fracture performance. Application of new model conductivity correlations results in a unique prediction for the acid fracture case study that differs from the industry standard. "

The diversion methods are categorized into chemical diversion and mechanical diversion. In this study, we focus on one of the classical mechanical-diversion methods, ball sealers. Ball-sealer diversion is used in cased and perforated wells to divert stimulation fluids by temporarily blocking perforation holes in the casing with rubber-coated balls. This diversion method can be very effective, particularly with highrate injection, but no general methodology is available to design ball-sealer diversion, or to evaluate its effectiveness from the treating rate and pressure record. Although some design methodologies, such as the use of buoyant ball sealers to improve the ball-sealer efficiency, have been suggested, no model has been presented for determining how many balls seat on the perforations. In this paper, experimental data from an extensive series of full-scale flow experiments conducted by Bern (1993) and Bern and Lewis (1992a, b) were analyzed. We summarized several features of the ball sealers which are not presented in the literature. Also we used the procedure presented by Brown et al. (1963) to evaluate the statistical nature of the ball behavior in the experimental results. The experiments were designed to minimize the scatter of data. However, the seating process was found to still be statistical. We developed an empirical correlation for ball-sealer performance on the basis of the experiments. We also analyzed one field acid-fracturing treatment where ball sealers were used as a diversion method. The analyzed data were then compared to the experimental results.

Various methods have been developed and applied in the field to determine the fluid placement and effectiveness of the diversion process, but determining the injection profile during the course of matrix acidizing still remains a challenge. Recently, distributed temperature-sensing (DTS) technology has enabled us to observe the dynamic temperature profile along the wellbore during acid treatments. Quantitative interpretation of dynamic temperature data can provide an invaluable tool to assess the effectiveness of the treatment as well as optimize the treatment through on-the-fly modification of the treatment parameters such as volume, injection rate, and diversion method. In this paper, we discuss how fluid placement can be quantified using dynamic temperature data. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the temperature behavior along the wellbore during and shortly after acid treatments. This model couples a wellbore and a near-wellbore flow and thermal model considering the effect of both mass and heat transfer between the wellbore and the formation. The model accounts for all significant thermal processes involved during a treatment, including heat of reaction, conduction, and convection. Then, an inversion procedure is applied to interpret the acid-distribution profile from the measured temperature profiles. To illustrate how to apply the model and analyze the DTS data, examples of matrix acidizing are presented. The temperature, flow, and pressure data were generated by a horizontal well-acidizing simulator. The inverse model is verified, and the effect of the distribution of stimulation fluid along the lateral and the effectiveness of the diversion processes on the transient temperature response is also discussed. We address some issues regarding solving the inverse problem and discuss the alternative methods of using warm-back information for cases in which inversion is difficult. "

Previous studies presented a completely new analysis technique for quantifying permeability and altered zone permeability and radius for multiple commingled layers. However, the previous model mainly applies for single-phase oil flow. A new wellbore/reservoir coupled flow model has been developed for multilayer commingled gas reservoirs including both damage and non-Darcy skin in each commingled layer. The non-Darcy effects are considered as permeability alteration and are incorporated to the reservoir flow model by using Forchheimer equation. Additionally, this coupled flow model can consider the pressure drop due to friction and kinetic energy changes in wellbore over the producing layers, which yields more accurate transient layer flow rate allocation. This coupled flow model is used to provide the wellbore pressure distribution and the radial reservoir pressure gradient for the coupled wellbore/reservoir temperature model. The temperature model is formulated using wellbore and reservoir energy balance equations considering subtle thermal factors such as Joule–Thomson effect and also using fluid properties which are dependent on in-situ pressure and temperature. The inverse method is adopted from previous study directly and is used for determining formation properties by doing nonlinear regression. The mathematical model is solved numerically and used to study the sensitivity of transient temperature behavior to formation properties. The results show that transient temperature behavior in the wellbore at strategic locations is very sensitive to formation property values and has some interesting characteristics. However, due to the non-Darcy effects, each producing layer in multilayer gas reservoirs has non-Darcy skin more or less, which makes the transient temperature changes in gas reservoirs show more complex behavior. In the end, two hypothetical examples are presented to show the performance of the inverse method. The regression results show that the damage skin location and magnitude can be determined correctly using the proposed testing method. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture fluid damage caused by residual polymer gel in propped fractures results in low fracture conductivity and short effective fracture length, sometimes severely reducing the productivity of a hydraulically fractured well. The residual gels are concentrated in the filter cakes built on the fracture walls and have much higher polymer concentration than the original gel. The residual gel exhibits a higher yield stress and is difficult to remove after fracture closure. In this work we studied polymer gel behavior theoretically and experimentally in hydraulic fracturing. We developed a model to describe the flow behavior of residual polymer gel being displaced by gas in parallel plates. We developed analytical models for gas/liquid two-phase stratified flow of Newtonian gas and non-Newtonian residual gel to investigate gel cleanup under different conditions. The concentrated gel in the filter cake was modeled as a Herschel-Buckley fluid, a shear-thinning fluid following a power law relationship, but also having a yield stress. The model developed shows that three flow regimes may exist in a slot, depending on the gas flow rate and the filter-cake yield stress. At low gas velocities, the filter cake will be completely immobile. At higher gas velocity, the shear at the fracture wall exceeds the yield stress of the filter cake, and the gel is mobile, but with a plug flow region of constant velocity near the gas/gel interface. Finally, at high enough gas velocity, a fully developed velocity field in the gel is created. The parameters for the gel displacement model were evaluated by experiments. We examined the filter-cake formation by pumping the fracture fluid through a conductivity cell, allowing leakoff to build the filter cake, measuring the cake thickness, and flowing gas through the cell to simulate the cleanup process. The results show that the yield stress of the residual gel plays a critical role in gel cleanup. "

During the past several years, fracturing methods have evolved and improved rapidly; however, there still exist many uncertainties in fracture design. Several fracture-diagnostic techniques have been developed to improve the understanding of the fracturing process. In this study, after reviewing the application and limitations of the current fracture-diagnostic techniques, we describe the application of distributed temperature-sensing (DTS) technology as a complementary tool for real-time fracture diagnostics. DTS technology has enabled us to observe the dynamic-temperature profile along the wellbore during the treatment. However, quantitative interpretation of dynamic-temperature data is very challenging and requires in-depth mathematical modeling of heat and mass transfer during the treatment. We have developed a thermal model to simulate the temperature behavior along the wellbore during the treatment, as well as during the shut-in period. This model takes into account the effect of all significant thermal processes involved, including conduction and convection. Examples are presented to illustrate how this model can be applied for fracture stimulation diagnostics. Estimation of the fracture-initiation points, number of created fractures, and distribution of stimulation fluid along each isolated zone are the problems for which DTS technology can help obtain answers. The effectiveness of isolation can also be diagnosed by DTS technology because the heat-transfer mechanism changes when convection caused by leaking in isolation occurs. This information can be used for more-accurate fracture modeling and better estimation of fracture conductivity and fracture geometry and, therefore, to optimize future treatments and also to evaluate the well performance.

Recently, distributed-temperature-sensing technology has enabled us to observe dynamic temperature profiles along a wellbore during and after an acid treatment. This technology allows us to monitor and evaluate treatments in real time by capturing a sequence of temperature profiles at different times and evaluating temperature response to acid injection. We have developed mathematical models to simulate the temperature behavior along a wellbore, horizontal or vertical, during and just after an acid treatment. This approach couples a wellbore model and a near-wellbore thermal model considering the effects of both mass and heat transfer between the wellbore and the formation. The models account for all significant thermal processes involved during a treatment, including heat of reaction, conduction, and convection. An inversion procedure is applied to interpret the acid-distribution profiles from the measured temperature profiles. For horizontal wells, the results indicate that the distribution of stimulation fluid along a lateral and the effectiveness of diversion processes during an acid treatment can be quantified in real time using distributed-temperature measurements. The model shows that the relative injectivities into different zones can be interpreted from the temperature response measured during injection. For vertical wells, we have focused on diagnosing the volume of acid placed in each zone from the flowback temperature history. During the flowback period, the zones that have taken more acid volume will show more heating because of reaction and will have higher temperature when entering the wellbore. This provides a mechanism to quantitatively determine the acid distribution. The methods developed from this study can help to diagnose and optimize acidizing design, and improve the efficiency of acid stimulation. "

In this study, we modeled the deformation of the rough fracture surfaces acidized in heterogeneous formations based on the synthetic permeability distributions and developed a new correlation to calculate the acid-etched fracture conductivity. In our previous work, we modeled the dissolution of the fracture surfaces in formations having small-scale heterogeneities in permeability. The characterization of the correlated permeability fields of rock includes the average permeability, normalized correlation lengths in both horizontal and vertical directions, and normalized standard deviation. These statistical parameters have a significant influence on the fracture-etching profiles obtained from the model. Beginning with this fracture-width distribution, we have modeled the deformation of the fracture surfaces as closure stress is applied to the fracture. The elastic properties of the rock, such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, have effects on the size of the spaces remaining open after fracture closure. After the model yields the width profile under closure stress, the overall conductivity of the fracture is then obtained by numerically modeling the flow through this heterogeneous system. In this paper, we introduce our models and investigate the effects of permeability and mineralogy distributions and rock elastic properties on the overall conductivity of an acid-etched fracture. A new acid-fracture conductivity correlation is developed on the basis of many numerical experiments. "

                    "abstract": "Successful acid stimulation of long-horizontal-well intervals in carbonate reservoirs requires effective acid distribution along the entire reservoir length. Such treatments also require large volumes of acid and seawater/brine injection at sufficiently high injection rates to drive the acid wormholes deep into the reservoir. Under these flowing conditions, significantly large tubing friction loss is anticipated unless optimal friction reducer performance in the tubing is maintained throughout the pumping operation. Because prediction of wormhole penetration and corresponding skin factor depends on analysis of downhole-injection pressures at the reservoir face, it is crucial to properly account for these hydrostatic and friction changes prior to evaluation of wormhole length and skin factor. In this study, an integrated flow model has been developed to predict the wellbore-pressure profile and wormhole distribution by tracking the movement of the acid in the wellbore and the formation. The wellbore-flow model is based on steady-state, 1D, pressure-based nodal method. The segmented wellbore in the reservoir interval is then coupled with analytical transient reservoir-flow models. The wormhole propagation in the formation is calculated based on the modified Buijse-Glasbergen correlation and upscaling model developed in our earlier work. The resultant wormholing skin factor is calculated by simulating and updating the changing well injectivity along the entire injection interval at every timestep. The model developed in this work is applicable for both fully completed wells (i.e., radial flow) and selectively completed perforation-cluster wells (i.e., spherical flow) typically employed in carbonate reservoirs. Analysis of injection rates and pressures during acid treatment provides engineers with a way to determine the varying injectivity and tubing friction as stimulation proceeds. The model presented here can be used as a forward model for analyzing real-time treatment rate and pressure histories and can also be used to review past treatments to improve future treatment designs. Using actual field-stimulation data, we also discuss key elements to successful stimulation planning and the diagnosis of matrix-acid treatments to achieve effective wormhole coverage for horizontal completions in carbonate formations.

                    "abstract": "Matrix-acidizing models have traditionally underpredicted acid-stimulation benefits because of underprediction of wormhole penetration and the corresponding magnitude of completion-skin factors in vertical wells. For long horizontal wells drilled in carbonate reservoirs, productivity enhancement is a function of acid placement and effective wormhole penetration. However, prediction of wormhole penetration requires more effective analysis than that provided by current industry models. This paper presents results of matrix-acid modeling work for horizontal wells and describes a practical engineering tool for analyzing the progress of matrix-acid stimulation in carbonate reservoirs. The wormhole-growth model is based on the Buijse and Glasbergen empirical correlation. Combining with the mechanistic model of the wormhole propagation based on acid transport and fluid loss from a single wormhole, a modified Buijse-Glasbergen wormhole-growth model is developed that relates the wormhole growth rate to the in-situ injection velocity at the tip of the dominant wormhole. The wormhole constitutive model developed in this study also accounts for core-size dependencies seen in laboratory acid-flood experiments. A semianalytical flow correlation is derived for estimating interstitial velocities at the tip of the dominant wormholes based on a number of 3D FEM simulation analyses, accounting for more realistic flow regimes (radial and spherical flow) typically observed in field application. The scaleup procedure developed in this study extends the wormhole geometry and penetration from laboratory flow tests on small cores to field-sized treatments. The scaleup procedure developed in this work can be applied to cemented and uncemented horizontal wells, including barefoot and perforation-cluster completions typically employed in carbonate reservoirs. Application of this modeling shows that acid wormholing through carbonate formations can provide significant stimulation, resulting in post-stimulation skins as low as -3.5 to -4.0 vs. previously predicted values in the -1.0 to -2.0 range.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Horizontal wells and multilateral wells have been applied in conventional and unconventional resource to improve recovery of hydrocarbon by increasing the contact of wellbores with reservoirs. In order to estimate production rate, many analytical models have been developed in the past years. One of the commonly used models is the Babu and Odeh's model which introduces a concept of partial penetration skin factor to transfer an analytical model for vertical wells to horizontal well mode. The partial penetration skin, SR, which accounts for the deviation of production for a partially-penetrated well in a reservoir (more likely in horizontal well scenarios) from a fully-penetrated well, is estimated by a correlation based on the reservoir simulation results. The correlation is one of the key elements in the Babu and Odeh's model, and it made the model flexible and convenient to use. The limit of the correlation is that the error of the calculation is increasing as the ratio of wellbore length to reservoir dimension decreases. Meanwhile, to consider the influence of permeability heterogeneity and wellbore pressure drop on well performance in these models, a segment approach is also commonly used for a horizontal well which divides the entire wellbore into smaller piece while calculating the pressure and flow relationship. When a well is segmented, the segmented well length is most likely lower than the limit of the partial penetration skin correlation applies. This raises a question of how the partial penetration skin should be distributed for different segments. The conventional method is to only apply the SR to the toe and heel segments when segment a wellbore, since the centered segments are considered fully-penetrated. This sometimes results in unreasonably low flow rate in these two segments compared to the segments in the middle. The toe and the heel segments should have high flow rate because of the larger drainage area contacted at these segments compared with the center segments in partial-penetrated wells. A new approach to distribute the partial penetration skin is needed to solve this problem.  In this work, we discuss several approaches to reasonably distribute the total partial penetration skin over different segments. A new approaches is proposed to take into account of the effect of contact area, location of segments, as well as the drainage area on inflow performance. The result shows a more reasonable flow rate distribution for different segments of the new approach when compared with reservoir simulation results. This modification to the conventional approach for the segmented horizontal inflow model makes the analytical model more reasonable and applicable. Examples in the paper illustrate how to use the new approach to estimate horizontal well inflow performance.  Introduction The productivity of a horizontal well can be described by an inflow equation which related to the flow rate form the reservoir to the reservoir drawdown. The productivity can be predicted by either reservoir simulation models or analytical models. Although reservoir simulation models in general give more accurate and detailed results, they require extensive input information, and need more time and effort to be applied, compared with analytical modes. If assuming that the wellbore flowing pressure, pwf, is constant over the length of the horizontal well, (the wellbore pressure drop is negligible compared with the reservoir drawdown), and analytical inflow equations for horizontal wells can be developed at specified boundary conditions. Joshi's equation, for example, treated the 3D horizontal well flow problem to two separated 2D flow problems, and superposed pressure drops in the flow domain to obtain the total flow rate at steady-state boundary pressure (Joshi, 1988, and Economides et al.,1991). Butler used source method to solve the horizontal flow problem in a box-shaped reservoir with a fully penetrated horizontal wellbore under the steady-state flow condition. Furui solved the same problem by simplifying the flow to a linear flow and a redial flow, and identifying the boundary that separates the two flows. The flow problem at pseudo-steady state boundary condition is also solved by Badu and Odeh (1988), and Helmy and Wattenbarger (1998). Badu and Odeh's equation has been commonly referred in the industry. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple hydraulic fracture treatments in reservoirs with natural fractures create complex fracture networks. Predicting well performance in such a complex fracture network system is an extreme challenge. The statistical nature of natural fracture networks changes the flow characteristics from that of a single linear fracture. Simply using single linear fracture models for individual fractures, and then summing the flow from each fracture as the total flow rate for the network could introduce significant error. In this paper we present a semi-analytical model by a source method to estimate well performance in a complex fracture network system. The method simulates complex fracture systems in a more reasonable approach. We statistically assigned a fracture network of natural fractures, based on the spacing between fractures and fracture geometry. We then added multiple dominating hydraulic fractures to the natural fracture system. Each of the hydraulic fractures is connected to the horizontal wellbore, and some of the natural fractures are connected to the hydraulic fractures through the network description. Each fracture, natural or hydraulically induced, is treated as a series of slab sources. The analytical solution of superposed slab sources provides the base of the approach, and the overall flow from each fracture and the effect between the fractures are modeled by applying the superposition principle to all of the fractures. The fluid inside the natural fractures flows into the hydraulic fractures, and the fluid of the hydraulic fracture from both the reservoir and the natural fractures flows to the wellbore. The finite conductivity of hydraulic fractures is modeled by additional pressure drop inside the fracture, but it is neglected in natural fractures. This paper also shows that non-Darcy flow effects have an impact on the performance of fractured horizontal wells. In hydraulic fracture calculation, non-Darcy flow can be treated as the reduction of permeability in the fracture to a considerably smaller effective permeability. The reduction is about 2% to 20%, due to non-Darcy flow that can result in a low rate.  The semi-analytical solution presented can be used to efficiently calculate the flow rate of multistage-fractured wells. Examples are used to illustrate the application of the model to evaluate well performance in reservoirs that contain complex fracture networks.  Introduction North America has had a substantial growth in its unconventional oil and gas market over the last two decades. The primary reason for that growth is because North America, being a mature market, is beyond the peak production from its conventional hydrocarbon resources. New technology applications of multi-fractured horizontal wells allow us to produce at economical rates from these low permeable oil and gas resources. Since commercial exploration and production of oil and gas reservoirs began, there have been circumstances where the reservoir character or depositional model has caused difficulty in assessment. Production assessment of unconventional reservoirs using standard methodology has been problematic. The complexity of the fractured system posts the challenges to analytical models, and reservoir simulation of such a system is extremely time-consuming. "

Recently, distributed temperature sensing technology has enabled us to observe dynamic temperature profiles along the wellbore during and immediately following an acid treatment. This technology allows us to monitor and evaluate treatments and diversion methods in real-time from captured sequence of temperature profiles at different times during and after acid injection. We presented a mathematical model in previous papers to simulate the temperature behavior in the formation and along the wellbore, during and shortly after an acid treatment (Tan, 2009 and 2011). An inversion procedure was also included to interpret the acid distribution profile from the measured temperature data in a hypothetical example. In this paper, we apply our model to a field case. The well is a gas producers and was stimulated with acid treatments. The temperature data was measured with DTS tool during shut-in period, and shortly after each stage of the treatments. The model is used to quantify the acid distribution with the temperature data to evaluate the efficiency of acid treatments.

Results indicate that the model is applicable in the field operation for acid profiling and is helpful to evaluate and optimize acid treatments. Introduction In  carbonate formations, matrix acidizing is commonly applied to enhance well performance by removing the near-wellbore formation damage and creating wormholes inside the formation. For a successful acid stimulation treatment, placement of a sufficient volume of acid in all desired zones is critical. Particularly in thick, heterogeneous carbonate formations, acid distribution is a challenge for optimal stimulation results. Meanwhile, a variety of diversion methods are applied to evenly place the acid along the well, but the effectiveness of these diversion methods is generally only inferred from the rate and pressure behaviors during the treatment with high uncertainty. Therefore, diagnosis of acid flow profile has important impact on optimizing acid treatments and evaluating diversion results. Recently, distributed temperature sensing technology (DTS) has enabled us to observe dynamic temperature profiles along the wellbore during and after an acid treatment. These temperature profiles contain information related to formation properties, treatment effectiveness and acid distribution. It is possible to reveal the acid distribution from the interpretation of downhole temperature measurements.  Clanton et al. (2006) discussed the possibility of using a fiber-optic DTS system for real-time monitoring of acid stimulation treatments. Based on a qualitative analysis of the temperature data, they discussed the application of DTS for monitoring the acid front movement, volume of acid leaking off into the formation, cross flow during shut-in, and also evaluating the diversion effect during a treatment. Glasbergen et al. (2007 and 2009) discussed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of temperature data during an acid treatment by developing the tracer slug concept where we intentionally make a sequence of temperature disturbances and track the movement of a fluid slug. Applying this method, the velocity of the fluid slug in the wellbore and consequently the acid leakoff profile can be determined. However, there are some limitations of this tracer slug concept. To obtain the flow profile throughout a treatment, the method requires frequent change in the operation and a sequence of temperature disturbances needs to be created repeatedly. Meanwhile, the tracer slug may lose its temperature signature with time due to the heat transfer with surroundings. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Ultra-deepwater reservoirs are important unconventional reservoirs that have the potential to produce billions of barrels of hydrocarbons, and are usually high pressure and high temperature with relatively high permeability. One major challenge of an unconventional, ultra-deepwater reservoir is pumping an effective and robust fracture stimulation treatment. Hydraulic fracturing a high permeability reservoir (>100 md) can be different from hydraulic fracturing technology used in low permeability formations (<1 md) due to their difference in purpose. The main purpose of hydraulic fracturing a low permeability reservoir is to create a long, conductive path to enhance drainage area and ensure a commericially economic well. In a high permeability formation, hydraulic fracturing is predominantly used to bypass near wellbore formation damage, control sand production and reduce near wellbore pressure drop. Such a treatment is achieved by pumping a short fracture packed with high proppant concentrations and may also aim at achieving enough fracture length to increase productivity especially when reservoir fluid viscosity is high. To pump such a job and ensure long term productivity from the fracture, understanding the behavior of the proppant pack is critical.  A series of laboratory experiments have been conducted to study conductivity and fracture width with high proppant loading, high temperature and high pressure using a Cooke conductivity cell. In this study, proppant was manually placed between two core samples and fracture fluid was initially pumped through the proppant pack. Conductivity was subsequently measured by pumping oil through the manually placed proppant pack to displace the fracture fluid and simulate reservoir conditions; resulting fracture fluid clean-up and proppant pack performance were studied. High strength proppant, ideal for fracture stimulations with high closure stress, was used to study the effects of proppant fracture conductivity with different proppant loadings and closure stresses. Proppant crushing and fracture width were also measured and compared to proppant pack conductivity in certain cases.  Testing results while pumping oil through the proppant pack at reservoir conditions indicated almost immediate fracture fluid clean-up. Increasing proppant concentration in the fracture showed higher conductivity values in some cases, while increasing the effective closure stress during an individual test resulted in a significant loss in conductivity for all cases. Additionally, fracture width decreased with increased effective closure stress and time. Tests were also run to study the effect of cyclic loading and showed further degradation in conductivity and width.  Introduction The decrease in conventional oil reserves combined with the increase in demand for hydrocarbons has led the industry to pursue the development of more unconventional reserves to fill the gap for demand. An unconventional reservoir contains oil and gas which usually requires a method of hydraulic fracture stimulation or horizontal drilling to achieve a commercially economic production rate. Oil and gas produced from shale gas, tight gas sands, oil shale, and deepwater wells are all examples of unconventional reservoirs. These types of reservoirs are what have become, and will remain the driving force for increased technology. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract A novel method for creating short, highly conductive fractures in wells to bypass formation damage has been developed. The method uses relatively small material volumes, low horsepower and pump rate, produces minimal environment effect, and leaves the formation face and proppant pack residue free. Function and application of the method present significant varia-tions in treatment design and execution compared to traditional hydraulic fracturing past damage. This paper presents results of development work to confirm the method's applicability and to provide sufficient performance data to design initial field applications.  Introduction Near wellbore damage to wells prevents new wells from producing at the expected rate or causes wells on production to lose productivity with time. The problem has been addressed by applying small-volume hydraulic fracturing and by acidizing or solvent treatments to decrease damage to flow capacity near a wellbore. When well tests are performed to determine reser-voir and near-wellbore flow capacity, it has been found that a substantial fraction of the benefit from a larger fracturing treatment comes from near-wellbore damage removal, particularly in higher permeability reservoirs. There has long been a need for an environmentally-friendly, cheaper and more effective process to remove the effects of near-wellbore damage to the flow capacity of a well. This paper describes such a process.  The U. S. land market for small, accurately placed fracture treatments to bypass near-wellbore damage is significant and largely untouched by current technology developers. A recent estimate of small fracture treatments performed in the U. S., focused primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, came to 26,000 jobs/year. Market revenue was estimated at around $1 billion per year, with small independent operators and independent service companies representing the majority of consumers and suppliers.  A process has been developed and is ready for field testing that can create a wide, propped fracture for a limited distance, in the range of tens of feet, and that extends all the way to the wellbore. The process uses an environmentally-friendly polymer that is introduced into the wellbore in the form of solid pellets containing proppant. The polymer degrades in the presence of water to form a very viscous, proppant-laden gel fluid in the wellbore. Before the polymer degrades enough to allow prop-pant particles to settle, the proppant-containing gel is squeezed into the formation above fracturing pressure. The polymer continues to degrade to a clear aqueous solution, leaving no damage in the fracture. The polymer degrades to an acid, which can be effective to create fracture conductivity without proppant in carbonate formations.  The benefits of this process include: •  Creation of wide, high-conductivity fracture near wellbore •  Use of much less water •  No damage to proppant pack or formation face from polymer residue •  Less horsepower and fewer surface units •  Polymer synthesized from renewable resources that degrade to environmentally benign end products "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this study we have undertaken a systematic investigation of the interactive effects of the key parameters that affect the final conductivity of a propped fracture, including flow back rate, proppant loading, polymer loading in the fracture fluid, the presence or absence of breaker, closure stress, and reservoir temperature. Fracture conductivity for conditions representative of field conditions was measured using a dynamic fracture conductivity testing procedure in which a fracture fluid/proppant slurry was pumped through a fracture conductivity cell, and then shut in and closure stress applied. Water-saturated gas was flowed through the fracture for a period of time at each closure stress to mimic gas flow back during the early stages of production. In all experiments, the proppant used was 30/50 mesh ceramic proppant. We used a fractional factorial design methodology to determine the relative importance of the fracturing parameters varied. The fractional factorial design method examines the combined effects on conductivity of potentially interacting parameters, while minimizing the number of experimental runs required.  The effects of the investigated factors arranged in order of decreasing impact on conductivity are closure stress, temperature, flow back rate, polymer loading, proppant concentration and presence of breaker. Increases in closure stress, flow back rate, temperature and polymer loading were observed to have deleterious effects on fracture conductivity. In particular, at high closure stresses and high temperatures, fracture conductivity was severely reduced due to the formation of a dense proppant-polymer cake. Dehydration of the residual gel in the fracture appears to cause severe damage to the proppant conductivity at higher temperatures. Also, at low proppant concentrations, there is the increased likelihood of the formation of channels resulting in high fracture conductivities.  Introduction Wells in low and ultralow permeability reservoirs are routinely fractured to ensure optimum productivity. A key determinant of the scale of the expected productivity increase is the final conductivity of the proppant pack. Factors that contribute to the deterioration of the conductivity of the proppant pack include but are not limited to proppant crushing, two-phase flow, formation of polymeric filter cake on the walls of the fracture, and gel damage (Wang et al. 2010). Deterioration of the conductivity of the proppant pack leads to negative impact on well performance.  Laboratory conductivity tests are often used as a benchmark to estimate the conductivity of hydraulic fractures. This is not a recent development in the petroleum industry. Cooke (1973) investigated the effect of temperature and closure stress on the conductivity of vertical fractures packed with several layers of brittle proppant in a conductivity cell. His results indicated that for the systems he investigated, better conductivities are derived when the treatment fluid is oil-based. Also, fracture conductivity has an inverse relationship with closure stress (for all fluids tested) and temperature (just for brine). Non-Darcy flow is also important, especially at high gas flow rates. It was observed that both polymer and proppant concentrations in the fracture after closure will be markedly different from the initial injected concentrations. Cooke (1975) developed theoretical models to compute the pore volume of propped fracture without residue, reduction of the pore volume by fracturing fluid residue—amount of residue depends on polymer and breaker loading, and the effect of the residue on fracture conductivity. Residue from guar-based fluids was seen as very detrimental to fracture conductivity. The presence of fluid-loss additives had negligible effect. Other factors that affect the magnitude of conductivity reduction include proppant concentration, porosity of the proppant pack, and the fraction of the residue resident in the fracture after leak off (Cooke 1975).

The CRM is a material balance-based model that requires only injection and production history, which are the most readily available data gathered throughout the production life of a reservoir. In this work, state-space (SS) equations are derived to describe the dynamic behavior of several CRM representations as a multi-input/multi-output system (matrix representation), computing reservoir dynamics simultaneously as a single system with interactions between injectors and producers. Interwell connectivities, time constants and productivity indices are estimated using a grey-box system identification algorithm. The matrix form of the CRM history matching and a sensitivity analysis to the CRM parameters estimates are presented. This process is computationally fast and easy to apply in fields with a large number of wells. Two case studies validate the proposed methodology: (1) homogeneous reservoir with flow barriers; and (2) channelized reservoir. A comparison between streamline allocation factors and CRM interwell connectivities for every injector-producer pair in the case studies is included to clarify their physical meaning, similarities and differences. The results lead to the following findings: 1) there is a fair correlation between CRM interwell connectivities and streamline allocation factors but the CRM values correspond to the pressure support and can connect more distant injector-producer pairs. The streamline allocation factors reflect water front advance and are largely limited to adjacent wells; 2) the CRM is significantly less sensitive to noise in flowrates than in BHP measurements; and 3) Different CRM representations show important performance differences based on reservoir heterogeneity, input variations and noise levels.

                    "abstract": "Analytical single-well models have been particularly useful in forecasting production rates and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for the massive number of wells in unconventional reservoirs. In this work, a physics-based decline-curve model accounting for linear flow and material balance in horizontal multistage-hydraulically-fractured wells is introduced. The main characteristics of pressure diffusion in the porous media and the fact that the reservoir is a limited resource are embedded in the functional form, such that there is a transition from transient to boundary-dominated flow and the EUR is always finite. Analogously to the frequently used Arps (1945) hyperbolic model, the new model has only three parameters, where two of them define the decline profile and the third one is a multiplier. This model is applied to a large data set in a work flow that incorporates heuristic knowledge into the history matching and uncertainty quantification by assigning weights to rate measurements. The heuristic rules aim to lessen the effects of nonreservoir-related variations in the production data (e.g., temporary shut-in caused by fracturing in a neighboring well) and emphasize the reservoir dynamics to perform reliable predictions. However, there are additional degrees of freedom in the way these rules define the values of the weights; therefore, a criterion is established that “calibrates” the uncertainty in the probabilistic models by adjusting the parameters in the heuristic rules. Uncertainty quantification and calibration are performed using a Bayesian approach with hindcasts. This methodology is implemented in an automated framework and applied to 992 gas wells from the Barnett Shale. A comparison with the Arps (1945) hyperbolic model, the Duong (2011) model, and stretched exponential model for this data set shows that the new model is the most conservative in terms of estimated reserves.

                    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling of unconventional reservoirs is a complex and challenging problem. The traditional approach is to construct a SRV based numerical model to predict long-term performance. The glaring limitation of this approach is that the model quickly becomes mathematically expensive if we attempt to capture complex geometries and incorporate non-planar/non-orthogonal induced/natural fractures. Also, these numerical models are generally constrained to planar geometry only, as an exhaustive suite of fracture orientations is not practical. It is done in order to simplify assigning fracture conductivities in the model. The method outlined in this paper eliminates the first limitation with the help of a dual porosity semi-analytical model. The other limitation of knowing fracture conductivity of non-planar fractures is overcome by incorporating the dimensionless fracture conductivity in this dual porosity model by comparing it with an equivalent single porosity planar model during bilinear flow regime. This new method, based on dimensionless productivity index and its derivative, uses dual porosity constant volume fractures in linear reservoirs. Dimensionless productivity index essentially conveys information regarding area generated due to transient average reservoir pressure over a given drainage area. The resulting horizontal well performance, which contains part natural fracture and part induced hydraulic fracture, is based on well test parameters evaluated from production data. These parameters help freeze the rate transient solution in the time domain. The early time analysis of flowback (fracturing water and gas/oil) gives us the insight into induced fractures. The connectivity issue is addressed with the help slab (planar 1D), cylinder (non-planar 2D) and sphere (non-planar 3D) matrix orientations which encompass all possible ranges of fracture (natural and induced) orientation that impact long-term performance. The result of this approach brings to light the pressure support and effect of flowback water on longterm performance of hydraulically fractured horizontal wells. This is demonstrated with the help of published literature data and shows how flowback analysis complements the conventional rate transient analysis for finite conductivity fractures in linear reservoirs. The method outlined here amounts to analyzing various fractures having different fracture conductivities and having different non-orthogonal orientations, with sphere matrix orientations being the maximum limiting case scenario. As opposed to this, the traditional numerical method requires running a large number of scenarios on a numerical simulator making it a prohibitively large problem. Eliminating this need brings out the significance of the approach. "

                    "abstract": "Fast simulation algorithms based on reduced-order modeling have been developed in order to facilitate large-scale and complex computationally intensive reservoir simulation and optimization. Methods like proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) have been successfully used to efficiently capture and predict the behavior of reservoir fluid flow. Non-intrusive techniques (e.g., DMD), are especially attractive as it is a data-driven approach that do not require code modifications (equation free). In this paper, we will further enhance the application of the DMD, by investigating sparse approximations of the snapshots. This is particularly useful when there is a limited number of sparse measurements as in the case of reservoir simulation. The approach taken here is the snapshot-based model reduction, whereby one computes a sequence of reservoir simulation solutions (e.g., pressures and water saturations in the case of two-phase flow model) forming a big data matrix – we call this the offline step - that is used to compute basis for representing the states of the system for different input parameters – the online step. The selection of these few basis is the core of the model reduction methods. DMD selects the basis and apply the reduction without knowledge of the inner works of the reservoir simulator, as opposed to the POD methods. Sparse DMD has been introduced recently to determine the subset of the DMD models that has the most profound influence on the quality of the approximation of the snapshot sequence. Two model reduction process are involved. One is offline process, which does not require running the simulator but rather predicting future behavior with linear combination of DMD modes. The other online process incorporates sparsity DMD modes in numerical simulator to release the burden of linear matrix solver. We first show the methodology applied to a 3-D single phase flow problem. Here we show the DMD modes and its physical interpretations, and then move to two phase flow for 2-D heterogeneous reservoir using the SPE-10 benchmark. Both online and offline process will be used for evaluation. We observe that with a few DMD modes we can capture the behavior of the reservoir models. Sparse DMD leads to the optimal selection of the few DMD modes. We also assess the trade-offs between problem size and computational time for each reservoir model. The novelty of our method is the application of sparse DMD, which is a data-driven technique and the ability to select few optimal basis for the case of reservoir simulation. "

To adapt at the online stage the states (velocity, pressure and saturation) of the system, we incorporate new data, as it becomes available. Once the criterion for updates is satisfied, we adapt the reduced system online by updating the POD subspace and the DEIM approximation of the nonlinear functions. These global online basis function updates improve the accuracy of snapshot approximation. Since the adaption is performed infrequently, the new methodology does not add a significant computational overhead due to the adaptation of the reduced bases. Our approach is particularly useful for situations where one needs to solve the reduced system for inputs or controls that result in a solution outside the span of the snapshots generated in the offline stage. Our method is able to construct a robust reduced system even if an initial poor choice of snapshots is used. We demonstrate with a numerical experiment to demonstrate the efficiency of our method. "

The three methods include a traditional piece-wise constant (PWC) approximation, a polynomial approximation by Chebyshev orthogonal polynomials and a piece-wise polynomial approximation by cubic Spline interpolation. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition with Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (POD-DEIM) accomplishes the reduced order modeling (ROM).. We compare a gradient-free global stochastic search approach and a gradient-based local search approach. We used Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a gradient-free algorithm and Interior-Point Optimization (IPOPT) with L-BFGS method as a gradient-based algorithm. First, we compare the performances of the three parametrization methods solved by each optimizer, using fine scale simulations for an increasing level of parametrization refinement. Then, in the second part of this paper, we combine the parametrization methods with the reduced modeling workflow. For a given level of parametrization refinement, we compare the performance of each parametrization method coupled with POD-DEIM, and solved by each optimizer. In this part, we introduce an online training procedure, where the first optimization iteration is used to construct the snapshot matrix. The results demonstrate how refining the control approximation with more decision variables per well lead to better NPV values, but with a higher computational cost. The best NPV was achieved using the highest refining level with Chebyshev polynomial approximation. Both polynomial and piece-wise polynomial approximations served as better training sets for POD-DEIM leading to a more accurate and fast reduced model. With the strategy proposed, POD-DEIM showed the best optimization accuracy for Chebyshev polynomial with the gradient-free optimizer, thus permitting the use of the model reduction methodology for global-stochastic search methods. However, the gradient-based approach seems to consistently outperform the gradient-free approach in terms of NPV and number of iterations for the cases shown. "

To this end, we use the trajectory-based DEIM (TDEIM) to approximate the nonlinear terms in the simulation. Specifically, the nonlinear terms in the test simulation can be expressed as the sum of the nonlinear terms evaluated at the closest available training point from the high-fidelity training trajectory and a perturbed term defined as the difference between the the test and the training terms. We only interpolate this perturbed term in the reduced space of DEIM instead of the original nonlinear term, resulting in computational savings and improvement in accuracy. TDEIM is further combined with the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method to provide an efficient POD-TDEIM framework. We test our new methodology on two examples, involving two-phase (water-oil) heterogeneous reservoir models. First, the performance of POD-TDEIM is compared with POD-TPWL and POD-DEIM on a 2D reservoir model. For the same set of high-fidelity training runs, POD-TDEIM outperforms the other two methods. We further propose an extended TDEIM in which the nonlinear term is expanded along the training trajectory to include one more derivative term.

Our approach identifies a low-dimensional structure in the solution space. We introduce an auxiliary variable (the velocity field) in our model reduction that achieves a high compression of the model. This compression is achieved because the velocity field is conservative for any low-order reduced model in our framework, whereas a typical global model reduction that is based on proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) Galerkin projection cannot guarantee local mass conservation. The lack of mass conservation can be observed in numerical simulations that use finite-volume-based approaches. The discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) approximates fine-grid nonlinear functions in Newton iterations. This approach delivers an online computational cost that is independent of the fine-grid dimension. POD snapshots are inexpensively computed with local model-reduction techniques that are based on the generalized multiscale finite-element method (GMsFEM) that provides (1) a hierarchical approximation of the snapshot vectors, (2) adaptive computations with coarse grids, and (3) inexpensive global POD operations in small dimensional spaces on a coarse grid. By balancing the errors of the global and local reduced-order models, our new methodology provides an error bound in simulations. Our numerical results, by use of a two-phase immiscible flow, show a substantial speedup, and we compare our results with the standard POD-DEIM in a finite-volume setup. "

                    "abstract": "Parameter estimation through robust parameterization techniques has been addressed in many works associated with history matching and inverse problems. Reservoir models are in general complex, nonlinear, and large-scale with respect to the large number of states and unknown parameters. Thus, having a practical approach to replace the original set of highly correlated unknown parameters with non-correlated set of lower dimensionality, that captures the most significant features comparing to the original set, is of high importance. Furthermore, de-correlating system's parameters while keeping the geological description intact is critical to control the ill-posedness nature of such problems. We introduce the advantages of a new low dimensional parameterization approach for reservoir characterization applications utilizing multilinear algebra based techniques like higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD). In tensor based approaches like HOSVD, 2D permeability images are treated as they are, i.e., the data structure is kept as it is, whereas in conventional dimensionality reduction algorithms like SVD data has to be vectorized. Hence, compared to classical methods, higher redundancy reduction with less information loss can be achieved through decreasing present redundancies in all dimensions. In other words, HOSVD approximation results in a better compact data representation with respect to least square sense and geological consistency in comparison with classical algorithms. We examined the performance of the proposed parameterization technique against SVD approach on the SPE10 benchmark reservoir model as well as synthetic channelized permeability maps to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. Moreover, to acquire statistical consistency, we repeat all experiments for a set of 1000 unknown geological samples and provide comparison using RMSE analysis. Results prove that, for a fixed compression ratio, the performance of the proposed approach outperforms that of conventional methods perceptually and in terms of least square measure. "

Despite their frequent use and improvements in algorithm and processor performance, accurate resolution of these flows is a computationally intensive task for many regimes. The resulting computational burden persists as a barrier to the inclusion of fully resolved two-dimensional shallow water models in many applications, particularly when the analysis involves optimal design, parameter inversion, risk assessment, and/or uncertainty quantification. Here, we consider model reduction for a stabilized finite element approximation of the SWE that can resolve advection-dominated problems with shocks but is also suitable for more smoothly varying riverine and estuarine flows. The model reduction is performed using Galerkin projection on a global basis provided by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). To achieve realistic speedup, we evaluate alternative techniques for the reduction of the non-polynomial nonlinearities that arise in the stabilized formulation. We evaluate the schemes’ performance by considering their accuracy, robustness, and speed for idealized test problems representative of dam-break and riverine flows. "

However, the complete understanding of the production mechanisms in shale reservoirs (micro to macro scales) and the closely interaction between natural fractures and the overall production profile at reservoir scales are in the infancy stages of their developments. In this paper we are particularly interested in extending the robustness and computational effectiveness of the Lattice Boltzman Method (LBM) applied to fractured porous media simulation. In this paper we propose a novel approach for modeling of shale reservoirs can seamless integrate rock-fluid behavior at small scales with the well-reservoir interaction at macro scales. This is done by exploring further the advantages of physical-based premises of the LBM by including the recent developed non-uniform induced permeability field concept in order to simulate fracture media, which model variation of permeabiliry around hydraulic fracrures by a function of the distance away from the fracture. In our numerical studies, based on a single well reservoir with a planar fracture, we indicate that this approach is more consistent with the physics of shale production, as it does not rely on such formulas as Langmuir isotherm and Klinkenberg's formula, which have been originally derived for low-density gases.

The lattice Boltzmann method simulates fluid flow by defining a system with microscopic flow characteristics. In this method, the fluid consists of fictitious particles (mass fractions). These particles propagate (stream) and collide. The method assumes discretization of the physical system in both space and time. In space, the particles are allowed to move on lattice nodes. Interaction (possible collision) of particles is evaluated at these time steps. The interaction step is designed in such a way that the generalized Navier-Stokes equation is valid for the time-average motion of the particles. The focus of this work is the formulation of precise boundary conditions on the surface of fractures and the wellbore. In addition, the set of dimensionless parameters that govern the evolution of the pressure profile is redefined. Pressure profiles are presented visually throughout this paper to provide the reader insight how such a product would be utilized by the petroleum engineer. Most importantly, the methodology is tested against commercial software and results show excellent agree-ment for both homogenous and heterogenous reservoir cases. This strong agreement provides motivation for the oil and gas community to expand this model towards more complex subsurface conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Short-term optimization of an oil field has been used to increase economic value of oil recovery as compared to reactive control (shutting the well when water cut limit is reached, for instance), especially in the case of short-term production strategies. One way to improve the management of a field involves adjusting the production flow rates over a short time, maximizing the overall NPV during the life cycle of the field. Using intelligent wells (IW), the challenges include not only the optimization of well flow rates, but also the simultaneous adjustment of flow in each valve, controlling each aperture in a given production time. These optimal control strategies are often difficult to be realized in practice due to the large number of control variables involved in the optimization process, especially with larger number of wells and valves. To this end, this work proposes an efficient optimization framework employing a fast genetic algorithm (FGA) in order to adjust simultaneously the flow rates of wells and the valves aperture. We have used a commercial reservoir simulator whereby the flow rates of wells were optimized with an option available that calculates well rates when there is production constraint on the wells (platform capacity or other operational constraint) using production parameters in real time; and at the same time the flow in each valve was controlled through a keyword associated with the control of the aperture of valves by monitoring the pressure drop around of them. The FGA optimization algorithm employed is a global optimization method, which is robust and efficient for sweeping the solution space with many variables, and it is able to work with continuous and discrete variables simultaneously. We demonstrate the power of the FGA strategy by applying the methodology to a heterogeneous reservoir model based on Brazil's Namorado field, with four horizontal producers and four horizontal injector wells. Two producers were tested as intelligent, using two valves of continuous variation type. The rate of wells was determined using water cut values while there were constraints on the production of the platform. The valves were adjusted each 60 days, during the first four years of production, closing in the optimal time at the end of production. The results showed an improvement in reservoir management, increasing 3.7% of NPV, with additional gains around US$ 20 million (already discounted the costs of intelligent completion), increasing oil production and reducing water production. The combination of the tools available in a commercial simulator jointly with global optimization algorithm showed advantages of the operation of the wells and valves simultaneously. "

CRM is an input-output and material balance-based model, and requires only injection and production history, which are the most readily available data gathered throughout the production life of a reservoir. In this work, the CRM input-output relationship is explored by representing the CRM with state-space (SS) equations. The linear system SS equations define the relationship between inputs, outputs and states to completely describe system dynamics. The SS-CRM is a multi-input/multi-output (matrix) representation, which provides more insight into reservoir behavior than analyzing performance on a well-by-well basis. Thus, it is computationally faster and easier to apply in fields with large numbers of wells. The CRM parameters are estimated using a grey-box system identification algorithm. The matrix form of the CRM history matching and a sensitivity analysis to the CRM parameters estimates are presented. Minimal realizations and reduced order models are easily obtained with the SS-CRM approach. The performance of three CRM representations are analyzed: integrated (ICRM), producer based (CRMP) and injector-producer based (CRMIP). The methodology developed here is tested in two reservoir systems, homogeneous with flow barriers and channelized. We find that the ICRM does not reproduce the rate fluctuations as well as the CRMP and CRMIP. The CRMP works well for wells in low heterogeneity regions but not as well as the CRMIP in more heterogeneous areas, e.g. near the flanks of channel deposits. This new approach facilitates closed-loop reservoir management by enabling CRM's use for linear control algorithms, which can improve tracking performance and predictability, and is amenable to real-time optimization.

Our MOO approach allows weighing different production strategies in presence of multiple production and economic goals (or objectives) and offers the algorithm that gives quantitative and qualitative measures of “goodness” of the optimal production plans. We demonstrate by means of a shale play model based on the Barnett Shale that the objectives can be of economic (short- and long-term discounted net-present-values) or production (cumulative water production) nature. The framework handles objectives effectively and produces the Pareto optimal solutions without requiring the user to assign weights to each objective inside an aggregate function.

One way to improve the management of a field involves designing optimal production strategies by means of dynamically adjusting the production flow rates or bottom-hole pressures over the reservoir life-cycle and operation. A major difficulty occurs in optimizing production of all wells, according to constraint along the production of a field. These optimal control strategies are often difficult to be realized in practice due to the large number of control variables to be adjusted during the optimization process, requiring large amount of computational infrastructure in place. These challenges become even more evident with larger number of wells and with complex large-scale reservoirs. For these reasons, this work proposes a new hierarchical hybrid optimization framework employing model order reduction techniques in a closed-loop fashion. This paper proposes the use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), to reduce the computational effort, and to perform local optimization by means of gradient-based approach by using forward and adjoint models followed by aggressive line search process. This approach was applied in the UNISIM-I-D benchmark case, testing the performance of the optimization proposed in a complex reservoir with several producer and injector wells, whose conventional optimization would require a high computational cost. The results showed an improvement in reservoir management by means of additional gains in terms of NPV, and through the proposed robust optimization algorithm, we show advantages of the operation of the wells and in the reduction in the computational efforts necessary to attain optimal solutions. The efficiency of the gradient-based approach coupled with model order reduction can be combined in future entire optimization workflow with global optimum algorithms like Fast Genetic Algorithm. "

Fast surrogate models have been proposed to speed up reservoir-response predictions without compromising accuracy. Surrogate models either are derived by preserving the physics of the involved processes (e.g., mass balance) to provide reliable long-range predictions or are developed solely on the basis of statistical input/output relations, in which case they can only provide short-range predictions because of the absence of the physical processes that govern the long-term behavior of the reservoir. We present an alternative approach that combines the advantages of both statistics-based and physics-based methods by reducing the flow predictions in complex 3D models into a 1D flow-network model. The existing injection/production wells in the original model form the nodes or vertices of the flow network. Each pair of wells (nodes) in the flow network is connected by use of a 1D numerical simulation model, resulting in a connected network of 1D grid-based simulation models. The coupling between the individual 1D flow models is enforced at the nodes where network edges intersect. The proposed flow-network model provides a useful and fast tool for characterizing interwell connectivity, estimating drainage volume between each pair of wells, and predicting reservoir production over an extended period of time for optimization purposes. The parameters of the flow-network model are estimated by a robust training approach to ensure that the network model reproduces the response of the full model under a wide range of development strategies. This step helps the network model to preserve its predictive power during optimization iterations when alternative development strategies are proposed and evaluated to find the solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed flow-network model by use of two-phase waterflooding experiments. "

In particular, given a small-dimensional set of inputs (as compared to the fine model), we treat the problem using a combined local–global model reduction technique. The local model reduction is achieved through the use of the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) where a set of independently calculated basis functions are used in order to construct a suitable coarse approximation space. The multiscale basis function computations are localized to specified coarse subdomains, and follow an offline–online procedure in which a set of eigenvalue problems are used to capture the underlying behavior of the system. Because the offline stage accounts for a one-time preprocessing step, the online coarse space may be cheaply constructed for a given input state. We then apply balanced truncation (BT) to the online coarse system in order to obtain a global reduced-order approximation of the output state. BT recasts the model equation into a systems framework where the input–output mapping may be approximated through the spectral construction of a reduced-order model, and requires the solution of a set of Lyapunov equations. As the Lyapunov equations represent an expensive computation, the efficiency of the proposed method depends on the size of the online coarse space. The combined approach is shown to be flexible with respect to the online space and reduced dimensions, and may be readily modified in order to ensure that the resulting output errors are comparable.

The use of horizontal drilling has expanded at an almost exponential pace as it has been applied to unconventional reservoirs, and yet, the process is still done in a reactive fashion. This is to say that, many horizontal drilling decisions are still made by the directional driller using only his tally book with simple records showing the results of his prior actions.  Using the correlation presented in this paper, a system has been developed which allows for accurate prediction of the rate of change of wellbore deviation while a drillstring is being rotated ahead. Predictive models, typically centered on WOB or RPM, have been in existence for many years.  However, one parameter whose effect on wellbore deviation has not been investigated is mechanical specific energy.  MSE is a measure of the efficiency of the drilling process and has primarily been used for vibration analysis and rate of penetration optimization. Using published experimental data, a correlation was developed which shows a clear relationship between the dog-leg severity, rate of penetration (ROP) and MSE. The correlation requires only a few hundred feet of drilling before it is able to be tuned to match an individual well’s results. With minimal tuning throughout the drilling of a well, good results can be obtained with regards to forecasting dog-leg severity as the wellbores were drilled ahead. The correlation was tested using data from multiple, geo-steered wells drilled in a shale reservoir. The analysis of the correlation using real-world data proved it to be a robust and accurate method of predicting the magnitude of dog-leg severity. This work is a part of the overall industry push to understand the mechanics of what is occurring downhole and their effect on the many aspects of the drilling process.  The correlation allows for the prediction of what is now becoming a vital part of many of the wells we drill: the wellbore’s trajectory while rotating.  It works particularly well in horizontal or near-horizontal portions of the well, which is where the wellpath trajectory matters the most with regards to overall well productivity.  In addition, there are no special data requirements, only standard surface drilling parameter data.  Overall, the use of this correlation results in a smoother wellbore, drilled with a faster overall ROP with a better chance of staying within the geologic targets.

                    "abstract": "This work presents new solutions to modeling the production performance of hydraulically fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs, where intensive hydraulic fracturing creates a stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) with an induced permeability field within. We found previously that the permeability field induced in the SRV (single porosity) can be effectively represented by an exponential or linear dependence of permeability on the distance measured from the main hydraulic fracture plane. However, many researchers consider dual porosity as a necessary ingredient in modeling unconventional reservoirs. In this work, we extend the induced permeability field model to the dual porosity idealization, considering transient fluid transfer from matrix to natural fractures and distance-dependent properties of the medium of secondary porosity (affected by the intensive stimulation). We show that the combined effect of creating a main fracture and altering the properties of the medium of secondary porosity leads to a production behavior that can be characterized and understood provided that effects related to skin and varying flowing bottomhole pressure are correctly accounted for. In addition to the standard diagnostic tools for decline-curve or rate-transient analysis, we use the ratio between the production time and material balance time, a dimensionless group that enables identifying the characteristic signatures of flow regimes. We provide practical criteria to identify various scenarios affecting the data during the pre-linear and pre-bilinear flow regimes in the reservoir (short times). Then we show that transient, late transient and boundary dominated flow periods can also be diagnosed using the dimensionless group, providing a useful addition to existing procedures involving conventional plots. In connection to the new model, this work also discusses a novel approach to handle non-constant bottomhole pressure, the cause of significant distortion in production data at early times. In particular, we consider the effect of a bottomhole pressure exponentially approaching a stabilized value. We show that the deviation from the idealized constant bottomhole pressure case depends on the flow regime in the reservoir, fluid and reservoir properties, skin factor, and the mean lifetime (the time when 63% of the total change has happened) of the decaying part of the flowing pressure. The results reveal that half-, three-fourths-, and unit-slope straight lines (on log–log plot of production rate versus time) develop at short times during the increasing trend of production rate. These new flow regimes enable to gain useful information about the SRV from the early stage of the production history – if the quality of data allows such a detailed analysis. We present a field example involving multi-fractured horizontal wells producing from a shale-gas reservoir, to illustrate, in a practical manner, how to apply the new approach when interpreting production history of wells in unconventional reservoirs.

Fracture initiation points, vertical coverage and number of created fractures can be identified by DTS data. However, to evaluate the well performance, optimize future treatments and better understand fracture modeling, additional accurate quantitative information such as fracture conductivity and geometries need to be inferred from DTS data. In this study, we propose to set up a stochastic inverse problem to infer hydraulic fracture characteristics such as fracture conductivity and geometries by integrating real-time DTS monitoring data. We develop a synthetic non-isothermal simulation model containing a horizontal well with multi-stage transverse hydraulic fractures amenable for realist real-time DTS data. We also provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of different fracture and reservoir parameters in the monitored temperature data by means of sensitivity analysis. To estimate the hydraulic fracture characteristics, we employ the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), an ensemble based sequential model updating method, to assimilate DTS data. The EnKF enables us to perform quantitative fracture characterization and automatic history matching. The EnKF also offers several advantages for this application, including the ensemble formulation for uncertainty assessment, convenient gradient-free implementation, and the flexibility to incorporate additional monitoring data types. Examples are presented to illustrate the suitability of the EnKF-based fracture characterization for the inversion of DTS data to infer fracture geometries and conductivity. We demonstrate that by means of the EnKF we can identify accurately fracture halflength and fracture permeability from temperature inversion. "

                    "abstract": "Despite great advances in reservoir simulation capabilities with the introduction of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and enhanced solvers, high fidelity grid-based simulation still remains a challenging task. This task is especially demanding for fine-resolved geological reservoirs with multiphase and multicomponents and in production optimization and uncertainty quantification frameworks where several calls of the large scale simulation model need to be performed. Model order reduction techniques have been applied in porous media flow modeling in order to obtain fast simulation surrogates to alleviate the high computational cost associated with these simulations. The difficulty of applying model reduction techniques to porous media flow arises from the nonlinearity of the system. In order to overcome the issue of nonlinearity, we introduce the bilinear form of the dynamical system which in many cases produces a satisfying approximation of the system. The bilinear approximation is a simple form of the parent system and it is linear in the input and linear in the state but it not linear in both jointly. The bilinear form is computed using truncated multidimensional Taylor's expansion of the system terms. Examples are presented to illustrate this recent approach for the case of single phase flow modeling, and comparisons are made with the case of linearized models and the full nonlinear models. In addition, we present methods to reduce the complexity of the bilinear system of equations and results are presented that compare linear model reduction (balanced truncation) and nonlinear model reductions, such as POD techniques.

                    "abstract": "This work introduces a new model for the production-decline analysis (PDA) of hydraulically fractured wells on the basis of the concept of the induced permeability field. We consider the case when the hydraulic-fracturing operation--in addition to establishing the fundamental linear-flow geometry in the drainage volume--alters the ability of the formation to conduct fluids throughout, but with varying degrees depending on the distance from the main fracture plane. We show that, under these circumstances, the reservoir response departs from the uniform-permeability approach significantly. The new model differs from the once promising group of models that are inherently related to power-law-type variation of the permeability-area product and thus are burdened by a mathematical singularity inside the fracture. The analysis of field cases reveals that the induced permeability field can be properly represented by a linear or exponential function characterized by the maximal induced permeability k0 and the threshold permeability k*. Both these permeabilities are induced (superimposed on the formation) by the hydraulic-fracturing treatment; thus, the model can be considered as a simple, but nontrivial, formalization of the intuitive stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) concept. It is quite reasonable to assume that the maximum happens at the fracture face and that the minimum happens at the outer boundary of the SRV. The contrast between maximal and minimal permeability, SR-1/4-k0/k*, will be of considerable interest, and thus, we introduce a new term for it: stimulation ratio (SR). Knowledge of these parameters is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of today’s intensively stimulated well completions, especially multifractured horizontal wells in shale gas. The approach describes, in a straightforward manner, the production performance of such wells exhibiting transient linear flow and late-time boundary-dominated flow affected also by a skin effect (i.e., by an additional pressure drop in the system characterized by linear dependence on production rate). This work provides the induced-permeability-field model within the single-medium concept, and shows that some features widely believed to require a dual-medium (double-porosity) representation are already present. Advantages and drawbacks related to applying the concept in a dual-medium approach will be discussed in an upcoming work. We present the model and its analytical solution in Laplace space. We provide type curves for decline-curve analysis, closed-form approximate solutions in the time domain, field examples, and practical guidelines for the analysis of commonly occurring production characteristics of massively stimulated reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "Horizontal wellbore drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies have become standard development practices in unconventional gas reservoirs. In order to tap into the full potential of gas shale reservoirs and to produce them economically, it is essential to optimize not only the locations of hydraulic fracture (HF) stages along the given wellbore, but also the wellbore trajectory inside the reservoir. To deal with these two challenges simultaneously and in a seamless fashion, a framework of numerical optimization algorithms can be established. Application of such discrete optimization approach to the above-stated problem allows to enhance production from shale gas reservoirs and to increase the net present value (NPV) of unconventional assets. The novel hierarchical optimization structure operates in the following way: it places a horizontal wellbore (or wellbores) on the upper level and then distributes HF stages along the fixed well trajectory (or trajectories) on the lower level. Both levels of the framework use gradient-based stochastic strategy, namely, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). Application of this optimization technique permits to depart from the common practice of distributing HF stages evenly. We demonstrate utility of this idea with highly heterogeneous geologic systems that require HF spacing with non-even intensity. To assess efficiency of our approach, we compare the results obtained from SPSA optimization with those from Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) that is a stochastic, derivative-free numerical method.  The developed framework is tested on stimulation data from synthetic models. Our findings show that the systematic approach to optimization of horizontal wellbore and HF stages placement can improve the NPV of unconventional projects. "

Although great progress has been made in basically two fronts, namely, upscaling and model reduction, there has not been a consensus which method (or methods) is preferable in terms of the trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and if they indeed, result in large computational savings. In the particular case of model reduction, such as the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), in order to capture the nonlinear behavior of such models, many simulations or experiments are needed prior to the actual online computations and there in not a clear way to deal with the projection of the reduced basis onto the nonlinear terms for fast implementations.  This paper presents a step forward to reduced-order modeling in the reservoir simulation framework. In order to overcome the issues with the nonlinear projections, we proposed to use the POD-DEIM algorithm, based on POD combined with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) proposed for the solution of large-scale partial differential equations. The DEIM is based on the approximation of the nonlinear terms by means of an interpolatory projection of few selected snapshots of the nonlinear terms. In this case, computational savings can be obtained in a forward run of nonlinear models.  Also, in order to incorporate information from the multiple length of scales, especially in the case of highly heterogeneous porous media, we suggest the local-global model reduction framework using the multiscale modeling framework. In this case, we will extend the use of the balanced truncation formulation and show how to couple both frameworks. "

Our objective is to combine local model reduction techniques that are based on recently introduced spectral multiscale finite element methods (see [19]) with global model reduction methods such as balanced truncation approaches implemented on a coarse grid. Local multiscale methods considered in this paper use special eigenvalue problems in a local domain to systematically identify important features of the solution. In particular, our local approaches are capable of homogenizing localized features and representing them with one basis function per coarse node that are used in constructing a weight function for the local eigenvalue problem. Global model reduction based on balanced truncation methods is used to identify important global coarse-scale modes. This provides a substantial CPU savings as Lyapunov equations are solved for the coarse system. Typical local multiscale methods are designed to find an approximation of the solution for any given coarse-level inputs. In many practical applications, a goal is to find a reduced basis when the input space belongs to a smaller dimensional subspace of coarse-level inputs. The proposed approaches provide efficient model reduction tools in this direction. Our numerical results show that, only with a careful choice of the number of degrees of freedom for local multiscale spaces and global modes, one can achieve a balanced and optimal result. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Recently, history matching and optimization were brought together in the oil industry into an integrated and more structured approach called optimal closed-loop reservoir management. Closed-loop control algorithms have already been applied extensively in other engineering fields, including aerospace, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering. However, their applications to porous media flow, such as - in the current practices and improvements in oil and gas recovery, in aquifer management, in bio-landfill optimization, and in CO2 sequestration have been minimal due to the large-scale nature of existing problems that generate complex models for controller design and real-time implementation. Basically, three sources of high-dimensionality can be identified from the underlying reservoir models: size of parameter space, size of state space, and the number of scenarios or realizations necessary to account for uncertainty. In this paper we will address type problem of high dimensionality by focusing on the mitigation of the size of the state-space models by means of model-order reduction techniques in a systems framework. We will show how one can obtain accurate reduced order models which are amenable to fast implementations in the closed-loop framework by means of model predictive controllers (MPC).  Introduction In recent years, a fresh look at how real-time data may be integrated in the decision-making process and in the creation of value in the Oil & Gas industry has opened new avenues of research and, in turn, a new set of challenges have been put forth. Smart wells, e-field, i-fields, among other ideas were developed based on the premise that real-time data, field-wide optimization and parameter estimation (history matching) could be put together in a somewhat structured manner, called closed loop reservoir management. Large investments were made to deploy computers, sensors and actuators all over the field, ensuring continuous real-time influx of data. It is well disseminated in the industry that worldwide spending on the technological infrastructures for real time-data are ineffective unless value is created by utilizing the improved knowledge and information that these investments provide. The challenge is to bring about substantial improvement in developing software and work processes that can help us cope with this data flux. Therefore, we need to ensure that reasonably right control & optimization decisions are made more rapidly so that the \"real time?? nature of the smart wells is not lost.  Real time control and optimization appear to be impractical since reservoir models are highly non-linear and have a large number of parameters and states, and thus require large amount of computational power. In many cases, the underlying model used to solve the forward problem in an optimization or in an inverse modeling scheme (parameter estimation) is a product of discretization of a set of partial differential equations (PDE's). Hence, highly accurate and detailed description of the underlying models induce dynamical systems of large dimensions either in the state or parameter spaces (several millions of grid blocks are often obtained). Recent studies, however, show that from an input/output perspective, fairly simple models are preferable over complex ones. In this case, the speed of computations is greatly improved without penalizing the accuracy of the solutions.  The key challenge is to best manage reservoirs, constrained by production rates based on various economic scenarios, in order to meet energy demands and maximize profit. To address the energy demand challenges, a transformation in the paradigm of the utilization of \"real-time?? data has to be brought to bear, as one change from a static decision making to a dynamical and data-driven management of production in conjunction with real-time risk assessment. The use of modern methods of computational modeling and simulation may be the only means to account for the two major tasks involved in this paradigm shift: (1) large-scale computations; and (2) efficient utilization of the deluge of data streams.

                    "abstract": "Naturally fractured vuggy carbonate reservoirs play an important role in the world's oil and gas production. Pore-scale modeling is treated as an important approach for unveiling the flow mechanism in carbonate reservoirs. The realistic regeneration of fractured vuggy reservoirs needs to preserve the geological structures and complex pores morphologies. Nevertheless, regeneration of such reservoirs is a great challenge because of the co-existence of fractures and vugs over a wide range of scales. In this paper, the reference fracture-vug network will be divided into two systems: matrix-fracture and matrix-vug. The two systems are reconstructed in two ways: (I), the matrix-vug and matrix-fracture systems are generated by improved simulated annealing method (ISAM) and multiple point statistics algorithm (MPS), respectively; (II), both of the matrix-vug and matrix-fracture systems are generated by MPS. When applying for ISAM, the multipoint histogram mainly depends on the N-point template. The template is a unit configuration, which is considered as the characteristic of the geometric features. Based on this, we introduce the correlation coefficient matrix to determine an optimal template, and the accuracy of template selection algorithm is also discussed. The optimal template represents essential geological features of the training image, and its size is much smaller than the template size selected by entropy. Therefore, it can improve the computing efficiency while preserving the key properties of the network. Then, a superimposing method is proposed to create the fracture-vug network by combining the matrix-vug with matrix-fracture models. The superimposing method using ISAM (for matrix-vug model generation) and MPS (for matrix-fracture model generation) is called SMIM, while superimposing method using MPS (for both of matrix-vug and matrix-fracture models generation) is called SMM. Finally, the spatial connectivity, local percolation probability and patterns reproduction of the generated models are used to compare with those of the reference model. The results show that the 7-point template selected by the correlation coefficient matrix is enough to get the spatial features of the matrix-vug system. The generated fracture-vug network using the selected template is able to retrieve the patterns of training image (reference model) more accurately than other used templates. The fracture-vug network generated by superimposing method produces better results than the other methods (all named as “direct method”). The network simulated with SMIM algorithm matches the reference model better than SMM algorithm. The probable reason maybe exist in the different generation methods used for matrix-vug systems. The local percolation probability (LPP), treated as a general geometric characterization method, is used to characterize the connectivity of measured units at a given local porosity. The results of the probability analysis show that SMIM is better in depicting the expected patterns of geological heterogeneities and in producing higher degree of connectivity of pore space than the SMM. The pattern reproduction of SMIM model is assessed by scanning the generated model, and the ratio of pattern reproduction number to that of reference model (i.e. the similarity) is around 97.28%. These results may guide the further application of the proposed method to field-scale modeling of naturally fractured vuggy reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of naturally fractured vuggy reservoirs presents many challenges due to the coexistence of three very different kinds of media and their complex interaction on multiple scales. With current computing capabilities, conventional fine-scale single-porosity models are not practical for large-scale reservoir simulation. A multi-continuum reservoir model is presented as an effective approach to modeling fractured vuggy reservoirs on the coarse scale. This model consists of four different porosity systems, i.e. the matrix, fractures, isolated vugs and connected vugs. This study investigates mass exchange between different porosity systems with the final objective of developing new transfer functions that can be used as an application to upscaling fractured vuggy reservoir models. A well-designed procedure is proposed to obtain the novel transfer functions in multi-continuum fractured vuggy reservoir models. Different realizations of the vug-filled matrix blocks are generated to show the effect of vug fraction, distribution and connectivity on multi-phase fluid flow. For interporosity flow between vugs and the other two media, new formulations of the shape factors that incorporate the effect of vug spatial variation are developed respectively. The dominant mechanisms of multiphase fluid exchange between each two porosity systems (matrix-isolated vugs, fractures-connected vugs) are discussed separately. New transfer functions for multiphase flow in the multi-continuum fractured vuggy model to capture the complex flow mechanisms and emulate the results of the fine-grid model are provided. In addition, a transmissibility multiplier table is introduced as another connection term for the transfer functions to improve the accuracy of upscaling solution. Finally, a new upscaling approach by incorporating the proposed transfer functions into multi-continuum models is presented. This paper provides a new insight to the complex fluid exchange among three different media in fractured vuggy reservoirs. Results show that the new upscaling methodology helps to reduce the size of simulation model and improve the computational speed significantly, while providing an accurate representation of the fine-scale results.

                    "title": "Confronting the Simulation of Fluid Flow in Naturally Fractured Carbonate Karst Reservoirs",
                    "abstract": "Flow simulation in carbonate reservoirs presents many challenges due to the frequent occurrence of vugs and natural fractures therein. In conventional reservoir simulation practices, fluid flow in vugs and fractures is usually assumed as Darcy flow, and permeability values are estimated for vuggy regions and fractures. Although such estimations are often accomplished in reasonable ways, no physical or mathematical basis exists for them, and even the assumption of Darcy flow itself is questionable. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow for the simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoirs. The workflow is based on simulation results of a single-phase transient Brinkman model, which provides the correct and complete description of the coupled flow in vuggy and fractured reservoirs by unifying Stokes flow in vugs and fractures with Darcy flow in the rock matrix. The new workflow proceeds through an iterative procedure by increasing the permeability values of vugs and fractures without the disadvantages of accurately estimating them, and attains the final simulation results when a convergence pattern is observed. The novel workflow is implemented and compared with the conventional approaches in commercial reservoir simulators. The workflow is first applied to single-phase flow simulations in a fine-scale 3D geological model which is generated using the multiple-point geostatistical modeling technique, and then extended to immiscible two-phase flow and other multi-phase cases. Simulation results show that in most cases our new workflow yields higher production rate predictions than conventional approaches. This is due to the fact that the permeability values of vugs and fractures estimated by conventional methods are usually lower than the permeability values required for the iterative convergence of the new workflow. The results also have further implications on the history matching process that more focus should be put on fracture geometry, i.e. fracture width and half-length, since the use of fracture permeability alone has lost its physical meaning in the novel workflow according to the Brinkman equation.

However, modeling such reservoirs is a challenging task due to the co-existence of porous and free-flow domains over a wide range of scales. Realistic characterization of fractured vuggy reservoirs requires preservation of the geological structure and reproduction of patterns. In this study, we model a discrete fracture-vug network using microtomography and multiple-point geostatistics (MPG) modeling technique. For this purpose, micro-CT scan images of a real core is used to generate two micro-scale geological models (2D and 3D reference models, which are used as original training images) with three structures; matrix, fractures, and vugs. The structures in the reference models are also separated into matrix-fracture and matrix-vug to construct two other training images for each of the 2D and 3D original training images. The three training images are then used in MPG to generate multiple equiprobable models that mimic the original networks of the fractures and vugs. The models created using the original training images are called direct models. The others that are generated using the training images after separating the structures (matrix-fracture and matrix-vug), referred to as separable training images, are combined into fracture-vug-matrix models by superimposing the fracture networks from the matrix-fracture models on their corresponding matrix-vug models. These final three-structure models are called the combined models. The spatial continuity, connectivity, patterns reproduction, and flow performance of the generated models are compared with those of the reference models (original training images). The results show that, the separable modeling method produces better results when used in 2D modeling, however, that is not the case for 3D modeling. All the generated realizations preserved the structures and reproduced the spatial continuity of the reference models for 2 and 3D cases. In addition, the patterns are well reproduced in both cases. However, the connectivity and the flow performance of the traditional (direct) MPG method are found to be more accurate in the 3D case than those of the separable MPG method. These results proof that the separable MPG method is not suitable for real 3D naturally fractured vuggy reservoirs modeling applications. However, more detailed sensitivity analysis of the MPG parameters could provide new insights in utilizing this method for 3D reservoir modeling applications. "

                    "abstract": "The modeling and numerical simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoirs are extremely challenging due to non-Darcy flow in vugs and caves connected by fracture networks. The momentum balance of such flow has been shown to be better described by the Brinkman equation both physically and mathematically, and many methods have been proposed in the literature dealing with the steady-state Brinkman model. We carry Brinkman's idea one step further and propose a transient flow model which consists of the Brinkman equation and a generalized material balance equation, and the latter has proven to be exact in the fractured carbonate karst reservoir. Finite differences are implemented for the solution of the proposed transient flow model. This solution method is more straightforward, easier to derive and implement, and more apt to generalization from 2D to 3D cases than alternative techniques. Numerical simulation of the transient Brinkman model requires explicit solution of not only pressure at the center of each grid block, but also velocities at the interfaces between the blocks, which exaggerates the computational cost and makes the computational process more difficult and less stable. In this paper, we propose a simplified finite difference formulation of the transient Brinkman model, which significantly reduces the computational time of the simulation process, and improves accuracy and stability of the simulation results. We update our reservoir simulator with this new formulation and illustrate it with a complex 3D naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoir model. The results of this study form the foundation for future 3D multi-phase reservoir cases. "

In this paper, we present a single-phase transient flow model which is based on the Stokes-Brinkman equation and a generalized material balance equation. The generalized material balance equation proves to be exact in both cavities and porous media, and the Stokes-Brinkman equation mathematically combines Darcy and Stokes flow, thus allowing a seamless transition between the cavities and porous media with only minor amounts of perturbation introduced into the solutions. Finite differences are implemented for the solution of the proposed transient flow model. This solution method provides a smooth transition from standard multiple-porosity/permeability reservoir simulators and moreover, it is physically more straightforward, mathematically easier to derive and implement, and more apt to generalization from two-dimensional to three-dimensional cases than alternative techniques. Application of the derived transient flow model is shown by examples of three fine-scale 2-D geological models. The first two models, although simple, provide verification of the proposed transient flow model.

                    "abstract": "An extensive data collection, training, and field trial program was implemented to develop practices to mitigate a common form of bit damage in hard laminated formations. Analysis improved understanding of the physical phenomena causing the damage and a variety of operational practices and technical redesigns have resulted in reduced levels of bit dysfunction, increased bit life, as well as increased drill rate. In hard laminated formations, bit life is often limited by severe damage occurring in only the two outside cutter rows on the bit shoulder (Fig. 2). In 2014, the operator began a performance improvement program in the Greater Green River Basin, which included investigating the physical process through which this damage was occurring. High frequency downhole vibrations data was recorded on multiple wells at points throughout the BHA as well as at the bit. The data revealed that synchronous torsional oscillations (STO) were occurring, and these were enabling high lateral bit whirl. While the root cause is a form of stickslip, the damage observed has the appearance of whirl. Analysis showed that as the bit drilled the laminated interfaces, higher modes of STO may occur along with the basic primary torsional oscillation mode. STOs occur when the drillstring is rotated at specific speeds that cause higher frequency torsional resonance to develop in addition to the primary large torque and speed cycles that rig crews observe with stickslip. The high frequency oscillation within the drillstring had small amplitude, but it created sufficient loss of depth of cut that allowed the bit to move freely in the lateral direction, enabling high lateral vibrations. The effect is particularly pronounced in hard laminated formations where the depth of cut has already declined at each transition due to the increase in rock hardness. It has generally been observed by the industry that high levels of whirl are rarely seen simultaneously with high stickslip. The observations in the described case are significant in that they may explain those instances where they are seen together. Also, the operations personnel are generally not aware that primary and higher order torsional oscillations may be excited by specific rotary speeds and that new field practices are needed to identify and avoid these in real time. Field trials were conducted that included RPM step tests to determine non-resonant rotational speeds, WOB step tests to avoid the onset of full-stick, bits designed with depth-of-cut control to reduce torsional oscillation, roller reamers to ensure stabilizer drag wasn't contributing to stickslip, and extension of bit gauge length to reduce the lateral movement of the bit in response to lateral force from the BHA. Direct measurement, using high frequency downhole data, showed it is possible to achieve moderate reduction in bit dysfunction in hard laminated formations through these changes in practices and design. Greater gains might be expected with drillstrings having higher torsional stiffness than the 14,000 ft of 4 inch pipe used in these operations, or with less than the 5500ft of hard laminated formations. In other situations the gains would have been adequate to have enabled a bit to drill an entire interval without tripping. This work may have implications for operations in other unconventional plays, such as the Marcellus, Utica, Niobrara, Permian Basin, Haynesville, Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and Granite Wash, where laminated formations, small hole sizes, and small diameter drillpipe are common.

                    "abstract": "Bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs were assessed in field trials for their ability to achieve critical low inclination requirements, while simultaneously enabling high drill rates.  Because angle has historically been controlled by reducing weight on bit (WOB), these are often competing priorities.  The use of real time surveillance of mechanical specific energy (MSE) provided unique insights into the bit dysfunction that occurs with many practices used to control angle. These quantitative insights supported the development of BHA and operating practices that maintained low angle while also achieving major gains in drilling performance. The McGinness Hills field in Lander County Nevada is a geothermal operation with wells drilled in hard metamorphic and crystalline formations.  Wellbore inclinations must be maintained below 2.0 degrees in the critical 20 inch interval in order to allow use of lineshaft pumps, which is challenging in the required hole sizes and rock hardness.  Formation strengths are similar to petroleum operations in the Rockies and West Texas. Pendulum and packed-hole assemblies were tested, and straight motors and slick assemblies were used for corrections.  Well build rates were assumed to be controlled by the three-point curvature in the lower assembly and stabilizer placement was modified to control this curvature.  The effectiveness of the curvature control as WOB was increased was evaluated from inclination measurements.  Real time MSE analysis was used to manage bit operating performance and to determine the root causes of bit dysfunction. The results demonstrated that packed-hole assemblies could be designed that controlled inclination while enabling 2-3 times higher WOB, and that the use of pendulum assemblies should be eliminated.  Packed assemblies drilled 87% faster.  The increased WOB resulted in higher drill rates, major reduction in whirl and extended bit life, which are equally important performance objectives in hard rock drilling.  The use of MSE surveillance allowed the physical processes to be understood deterministically, so that the philosophical design principles can be applied in other petroleum and geothermal operations. Introduction The design and operating practices currently used to limit the inclination in vertical wells were largely developed in field operations prior to 1954.  The initial concepts were an intuitive and logical response to limit the flex that occurs in rotating assemblies to a level that preferential side-cutting from gravity could maintain the desired angle.  Slick assemblies with no stabilization dominated the industry until field experience and modeling in the early 1950’s showed “pendulums”, with 1-2 stabilizers, to be more effective (MacDonald and Lubinski, 1951).  In either case, it was necessary to limit WOB to maintain or reduce angle.

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a holistic model describing the relationship between the state of the hoop stress in a given well and the selection of lost circulation treatments. While some losses are vugular, the majority of lost returns events are due to the propagation of a fracture that develops when the borehole pressure overcomes the total hoop stress, which is the stress holding the hole closed. Although methods such as casing drilling, lost circulation pills or continuous fracture sealing fluids appear dissimilar, each stops losses by modifying the hoop stress. If a treatment does not modify the stress holding the hole closed, it does not change the pressure at which the borehole will open. This unifying concept is not always apparent to engineers and operations personnel since treatments are described to act in ways as diverse and seemingly unrelated as tip plugging, sealing, smearing, etc. Consequently, those who develop and execute new treatments may not be asking important questions that could further improve treatment performance and operational practices. In the proposed model, the potential state of the hoop stress is placed on a single pathway that is divided into four distinct regimes. At one end of the spectrum are those treatments that prevent losses by simply ensuring that the ideal hoop stress predicted by Kirsch is preserved. At the other end of the spectrum are severely depleted wells where treatments must achieve very large increases in hoop stress. Common industry treatments are categorized by the hoop stress regime in which they are applicable, and the conceptual limit to which each might enhance integrity is discussed. The authors' purpose in describing these concepts and treatments within a holistic hoop stress continuum is to improve treatment selection, facilitate field diagnostics, and highlight the need for further research in some areas.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The paper will discuss the role of digital data in a performance management process implemented by the operator in 2005. The Fast Drill Process (FDP) has resulted in an 80% worldwide increase in average drilling footage per day since its  implementation across 23 drill teams and numerous papers have described the workflow and specific operational practices (Dupriest, 2006, Dupriest et. al, 2010). However, the critical role of digital data within this process has not previously been discussed. Although FDP workflow is tailored to the operator's organization, there are many leanings discussed that are believed to be relevant to other data-driven field operations.  FDP is a continuous improvement workflow. As footage per day is increased, the next dominant factor limiting footage per day is identified and redesigned until some other factor becomes the limiter. The new limiter then becomes the object of redesign. Over a period of years, the pursuit of the next limiter has led to higher performance, but also to more complex operations. Continued gains have become increasingly dependent on the development of physics-based models and the collection of new types of data. We have observed a direct correlation between the level of data usage an operator can achieve at the rigsite and the drill team's performance.  This paper discusses some of the challenges that have arisen in deploying a data-driven workflow in an industry that has historically worked from empirical experience. Examples include actions taken to achieve the level of rigsite knowledge needed to sustain physics-based operations, steps taken to share critical data across global operations, the manner in which complexity impacts the use of digital data, and some of the specific types of performance limiters extended and new types of data that are being collected to support the physics-based models used to make the required real time decisions.  Introduction The volume and types of data that are being collected during drilling operations continues to increase. But new data does not result in new performance unless its existence actually changes the way the work is done. Consequently, a strategy to use data must begin with an understanding of the work, the people conducting the work, and the specific characteristics of the organization it is being implemented through. When developing a plan to use digital data, the starting point must be the question of \"to what purpose??? The manner in which data is used varies largely with the types of decisions that will be made with the information, particularly whether it is intended to maintain current practices or to change the practices.

                    "abstract": "In 2005, the operator implemented a workflow that ensured that drilling-performance limiters were identified, redesigned, and extended continuously. The use of mechanical-specific-energy (MSE) surveillance to address bit limiters and dysfunction has been published previously. The purpose of this paper is to discuss additional practices that have been developed to extend the nonbit performance limiters, particularly those related to borehole quality. There have been more than 40 nonbit performance limiters identified and redesigned globally. While these are diverse, those with the greatest global impact were found to be tied directly to borehole quality. Consequently, in 2008, the performance-management workflow was modified to increase awareness of borehole quality as a performance limiter. The result was that acceptable borehole quality became defined as that which would not limit footage per day. Quality is now redesigned to the \"economic limit of performance\" in the given interval. The economic limit of performance is a significantly higher standard than the common industry objective for borehole quality, which is to achieve low trouble time and to run casing successfully. The average drilling footage per day drilled by the 23 operations that have been active since the performance-management process was implemented has improved by approximately 63%. Instantaneous drill rates have typically increased 100-300%. Advances in bit and nonbit limiters appear to have contributed equally, and the majority of the gain in nonbit limiters has come from improved borehole quality. Other gains have come from related limiters, such as an increased understanding of the manner in which cuttings transport and tripping operations are controlled by borehole quality. The paper discusses the technical models that are used to understand the major borehole limiters, the engineering design, and the real-time practices that have been developed, as well as the field results.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The standard well control training drillers receive in the industry prepares them to respond to an influx that occurs during underbalanced conditions. The mechanism through which hydrocarbon may enter the wellbore following a vugular loss can differ from this. One potential result is that the influx may not be detected as early as that which occurs during a conventional underbalanced condition. The purpose of this paper is to provide a model to explain the unique mechanism through which kicks may occur following vugular losses, as well as effective recognition and response practices that are consistent with that model. When a loss occurs in a highly vugular zone the vugs offer no resistance to flow and the bottomhole pressure (BHP) will immediately fall to equal the pore pressure within the vug. The general belief that the BHP will not drop if drill weight mud is pumped continuously down the annulus is incorrect. Following the loss, the BHP then controls the pressure at any point in the mud column above the loss zone. The pressure at any point above will be approximately equal to BHP (pore pressure) minus the head of mud up to that point. In contrast, the pressure outside the wellbore in the carbonate will equal the same BHP minus a hydrocarbon gradient. Because the mud gradient in the wellbore will always be higher then the formation fluid gradient, the borehole pressure at all points above the loss zone will always become less than the formation pressure in the exposed carbonate, with the maximum underbalance being at the top. The influx that will occur will travel downward, displacing the mud to the loss zone. Once the interval is displaced to hydrocarbon the pressure gradients inside and outside the wellbore become the same and flow stops as there is no longer any differential to drive it. The entry of hydrocarbon at the top and the downward flushing of mud is referred to as a flow cell because it is initially a self-contained process. An important conclusion from understanding the manner in which the flow cell works is that any complete loss of returns in a carbonate may result in an influx and that this cannot be prevented by filling the annulus. The unique well control response in deepwater carbonates should then be to shut in as soon as any full loss of returns is observed.  This paper describes the flow cell and subsequent swapping mechanisms and recognition and response procedures to prevent an influx from traveling above the subsea stack before detection. Also described are unique challenges that the flow cell introduces and operational techniques that will allow the continued safe drilling of a subsea well in deep water with conventional marine riser and subsea BOP equipment.  Introduction When massive losses occur in vugular formations the well's behavior does not follow the conventional well control scenario. Gains are not seen in pit volumes despite hydrocarbon entry and kicks can go undetected until they have traveled some distance up the annulus. Once the kick is detected, backpressure cannot be held effectively to prevent further influx while circulating out the initial kick and annulus pressure trends and values appear to be unpredictable. It is also difficult to control the placement of fluids or pills. The most significant challenge is the inability to detect an influx as soon as it occurs. In deepwater wells the distance from the vugular zone to the subsea BOPs may be short. The challenge is illustrated in Fig 1. "

                    "abstract": "This paper discusses the results of a global campaign to increase the length of the gauge area of bits used on rotary-steerable systems (RSSs) to mitigate bit whirl and its undesirable effects. The desired steerability was achieved with lengths in excess of 4 in. with all RSS tools used. The modifications have resulted in reduced vibrations, significant improvement in drill rate, improved borehole quality, and reduced tool damage. When the operator's performance-management process was implemented, real-time and post-drill analysis of mechanical specific energy (MSE) suggested 40% of footage drilled worldwide was affected by bit whirl or lateral instability. One element in the programmatic response was an initiative beginning in 2006 to extend bit-gauge lengths to constrain side cutting and reduce the amplitude of whirl-induced patterns. The value of extended gauge lengths has been demonstrated in numerous papers. However, field implementation by the industry has not been uniform, and a significant issue has been concern that steerability would be reduced. The purpose of the initiative was to demonstrate that common build rates could be achieved with all RSS tools used by the operator with bits having a minimum gauge length of 4 in. In the subject wells over a 2-year period, normal build rates (2-4°/100 ft) were not affected with 4-in. gauges if the profile and aggressiveness were designed properly. The gauge profiles used to maintain steerability included full taper, full undercut, and partial undercut. While the desired steerability was achieved with both point-the-bit and push-the-bit RSS tools, specific modification required in the gauge profile varied with the RSS used, desired build rate, and drilling environment. Drill-rate performance and bit life also improved, but this was attributed partly to implementation of the performance-management process and specific rig-crew training. Extension of the gauge length is also known to benefit bent-motor operations (Norris et al. 1998); however, the effects of various gauge profiles are less certain, and motor operations are not discussed in this paper. The objective was not to determine the maximum build rates achievable but to simply confirm that gauge lengths of 4 in. or greater could be used as standard practice in normal operations. This paper discusses the rationale for the use of extended gauges, the modified profiles used to maintain steerability with various RSS tools, and the field performance achieved. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Borehole instability and stuck pipe while drilling coal can lead to significant non-productive time. This paper describes a drilling fluid developed to stabilize coals in a program that was previously unable to achieve all extended reach objectives. The fluid design principles are believed to apply broadly in stabilizing coals, fractured shale, and other cleated formations.  The rock mechanics that govern instability in coals is identical to shale. However, coal instability often does not respond to the same remediation used in shale, which is to simply raise the mud weight to reduce the compression hoop stress to below the strength of the rock. Despite using an optimum mud weight, hole breakout or borehole collapse may still occur when the coal cleats and natural fractures of the coal allow the drilling fluid filtrate to invade. This leads to a pressurization of the near-wellbore region and loss of the effectiveness of mud weight support for coal stability.  A fluid was developed based on the belief that the wellbore is stabilized with increased mud weight if the additional pressure acts specifically on the face of the borehole. This stabilization effect can be achieved by preventing pressure penetration into the near-wellbore region through coal cleats or natural fractures. The fluid design developed included bridging particles with a size distribution based on analysis of the coal cleat apertures, as well as filtration control material to effectively reduce the permeability of the bridge. Sealing alone does not provide stability and an analysis of the coal strength and in-situ stresses were conducted to select a mud weight that would stabilize the very weak coals.  The paper discusses the rock mechanics concepts, fluid design criteria for determining the allowed leakage rate when designing the bridging process, and the operational learnings from implementation. The use of the coal stabilization fluid and stability mud weight allowed the objectives to be achieved and contributed to record performance in this a narrow-margin drilling environment in Australia.  Introduction When drilling for hydrocarbons a number of formations have to be drilled before reaching the objective. These formations are as varied as shale, sandstone and carbonate, and sometimes coal seams. The recent years, however, have seen an increase in coal drilling due to an increased exploration into coal bed methane. Instability in coal is common, both in the overburden and within the productive interval. The high angles at which many extended reach wells are drilled contribute to both the incident rate and the consequence of instability. Several papers have been written on the experience in coal drilling and strategies to avoid or overcome these challenges. The practices used to drill coals vary, and many appear to be contradictory. One design decision that is often debated is whether it is generally more effective to increase or decrease the fluid density. Various authors have taken differing positions. The same concerns have also been debated by those drilling fracture shales, with similar logic and recommended practices. In both coals and fractured shale, field success is claimed with both higher and lower fluid densities. A comprehensive physics-based understanding of the failure process is required to explain the contradictory observations and develop design and field practices that are universally correct, rather than those that have been derived empirically and succeed only under specific local conditions.

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses a successful initiative begun six years ago to eliminate differential sticking across global operations. In the five year period from 2004 through 2008, there were only 3 differential sticking events in 3,476 wells drilled with the recommended practices. There were an additional 17 sticking events with designs that did not conform to recommended practices, and 14 of these were freed. The drilling environment was diverse. Overbalances in excess of 1,000 to 2,000 psi were common in multi-darcy rock and high angle, and depleted reservoirs have been drilled with overbalance as high as 7,800 psi in vertical wells.  The early focus of the Stuck Pipe Avoidance practices was the elimination of differential sticking. However, some level of sticking occurs routinely in drilling operations and these events only become problematic if the force required to initiate pipe movement exceeds what can be delivered to the stuck point. It is now accepted that sticking cannot be prevented and that elimination of sticking is not a proper design objective. The philosophical objective has now shifted from elimination of sticking to \"maintaining conditions that allow the pipe to be pulled free,?? assuming that it will become differentially stuck. The desire to maintain this ability to move the pipe has required the implementation of a range of practices, some of which were not common in the industry.  Changes were made in bottomhole assembly (BHA) design, fluid design, real-time cake shear strength recognition, and real-time cake remediation practices. A finite element (FE) model was also applied to redesign new systems or applications that lie outside the operator's previous experience. The stochastic model predicts cake growth and sticking force and the probability that it will be possible to deliver a force that can free the pipe for any given still-pipe time. The model inputs were calibrated through pullout tests with a variety of fluids to determine mechanical cake strength properties, the rate at which those properties develop, changes in the pressure transient through the cake as it matures, and the cake contact areas and geometry at any point in time.  Engineering and operations training also contributed greatly and allowed relatively uniform implementation to be achieved across a large, globally diverse operation in less than one year. A small number of non-compliant designs continued to be used and these contributed greatly to the incidence of stuck pipe in the first three years. Last year, there was only one incident of stuck pipe with a non-compliant design.  The paper describes the underlying sticking concepts, the engineering design and field practices used, the modeling capability, and the field results. "

They are the Braun and Burnham model and Wellington model. In these forward numerical simulations, we present the influence of the two reaction models on hydrocarbon production. The Braun and Burnham reaction model shows more vigorous kerogen and subsequent decomposition reactions and more hydrocarbon production than the Wellington model. A local sensitivity analysis identifies the reaction parameters with the highest influence on productivity, and the most sensitive outputs. A data-worth analysis identifies the most valuable observation data to be measured for the best prediction of total hydrocarbon production. We find that the most valuable observation data is the cumulative production of heavy oil in the Braun and Burnham model and of light oil in the Wellington model, respectively. Once we determine the maximum allowable prediction uncertainty and the expected measurement uncertainty, the observation data to be measured for the minimization of prediction uncertainty can be obtained.

Using a fine discretization describing the reactor assembly, the experimental process is faithfully replicated numerically. The multi-stage process of hydrate formation is subdivided in 7 steps. The experimental data from the continuously-monitored pressure and temperature during each step are used for comparison against the numerical predictions, the identification of the dominant processes and the determination of the associated parameters through a history-matching process that minimizes deviations between observations and simulation results. The results of this first-ever study on this subject demonstrate unequivocally that the hydration reaction is a kinetic (as opposed to an equilibrium) process, and that the spatial distributions of the various phases (aqueous, gas and hydrate) at the end of the formation process are strongly heterogeneous. This has serious implications in simulation studies of hydrate dissociation that assume uniform initial phase saturation distributions. The history-matching process indicates that (a) the system behaviour is sensitive to some flow parameters (porosity and irreducible water saturation) only during the first water injection, (b) it is insensitive to the sand intrinsic permeability during all steps of the study, and (c) thermal processes dominate after the first water injection, yielding estimates of the thermal properties of the sand and of time-variable key parameters of the kinetic reaction.

In this study, we use inverse modeling to determine oil shale grade and reaction parameters. The inversions are based on a forward model that simulates heat injection into a well. Temperature at the heating well is affected by a thermal skin effect as a result of a decrease of composite thermal conductivity around the heater due to the decomposition-induced porosity increase. Synthetic observations of heater temperature are generated from a forward simulation. Temperature difference and its derivative are used in synthetic inversions to estimate oil shale grade and parameters of active decomposition reactions with an error below 1%. The proposed methodology of inverse modeling is expected to successfully estimate the oil shale grade and reaction parameters without core sampling and subsequent surface experiments. "

For rigorous 3D coupled flow-geomechanical modeling, we employ a numerical method that can model failure by tensile and shear stresses, dynamic nonlinear permeability, dual continuum approach, and thermo-poro-mechanical effects. From numerical simulation, we find that the fracture propagation is not the same as propagation of the water front, because fracturing is governed by geomechanics whereas water saturation is determined by multiphase flow. At early times, the water front is almost identical to the fracture tip, suggesting that the fracture is mostly filled with the injected water. However, at late times, movement of the water front is retarded compared to fracture propagation, yielding a significant gap between the water front and the fracture top, filled with reservoir gas. During fracture propagation, the coupled flow-geomechanical models are transformed via a rock-physics model into electrical conductivity models. We employ a full 3D finite-element EM geophysical simulator to evaluate the sensitivity of the crosswell EM method to fracture propagation. It is shown that anomalous distribution of electrical conductivity is closely related to the injected water saturation, but not closely related to newly created unsaturated fractures. Our numerical modeling experiments demonstrate that the crosswell EM method can be highly sensitive to electrical conductivity changes that directly indicate the migration pathways of the injected fluid. Accordingly, the EM method can serve as an effective monitoring tool for monitoring the injected fluids during hydraulic fracturing operations. "

                    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the flow, thermal and geomechanical response of sloping oceanic accumulations of hydrates to stimuli that can induce dissociation, such as depressurization-induced gas production activities, with emphasis on the evaluation of the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. Using numerical simulation, we analyze the coupled flow, thermal, thermodynamic, chemical and geomechanical processes involved in the response of sloping hydrate accumulations exposed to dissociation-inducing stimuli associated with depressurization-based activities for the production of gas from the hydrate-bearing sediments. The study includes a sensitivity analysis of the system behavior to the angle of the slope in order to determine its effect on the system behavior, and cover the system long-term behavior following the cessation of the stimuli. We determine that gas production from hydrate-bearing media may cause subsidence that increases stresses along the well and reduces gas production, but does not appear to enhance the risk of hillslope stability while production continues. The risk of oceanic landslides increases slightly after the end of gas production as a result of the increase in the pressure in the reservoir where the hydrate (which imparts the bulk of mechanical strength to the unconsolidated oceanic sediments) is depleted or exhausted, but at no time is the system stability compromised for any slope angle. The paper provides an integrated quantitative analysis of the coupled processes that are involved in dissociating hydrates using themost advanced simulators, and makes significant contributions to the evaluation and risk assessment of potential problems associated with future production from oceanic hydrate deposits, in addition to providing insights that may lead to mitigation of the problems.

                    "abstract": "Due to its increasing abundance, cleaner and lower emissions upon combustion, natural gas (NG) has been considered as the best transition fuel away from coal and oil to a carbon-constrained world. Methane gas is the major component in NG accounting for 70-90%, and is also the major constituent found in natural gas hydrates (NGHs). The amount of CH4 preserved in NGHs is vast and estimated to be 20,000 trillion cubic meter (TCM) worldwide. This outweighs the proved NG reserve on earth, which is 865.4 TCM, and doubles the combined reserve of all fossil fuels. Thus, NGHs have been considered as a potential future energy source. Extensive geological surveys and drilling programs have been carried out during the past two decades at various countries (Canada, USA, Japan, S. Korea, India, China, etc.) to identify the location of these NGH reservoirs, to quantify the amount of gas deposited and to recover hydrate cores to analyze their thermophysical and geomechanical properties. Extensive research have also been carried out in laboratories to synthesis gas hydrate mimicking marine and permafrost conditions, and to study their fundamental behavior of formation and dissociation. In this study, we numerically analyzed an experiment of methane hydrate bearing sediment (P = 6.2 MPa) with hydrate saturation SH = 40% dissociation process induced by depressurization (P = 4 MPa) in a 1.0 L reactor with the production of water and gas. The simulation-predicted cumulative gas production shows an excellent agreement with the experimental measurement. In addition, from the evolution of phase saturation over time, it is revealed that hydrate dissociates from outer boundary to inner core. In addition, methane gas migrates to the reactor outer boundary first and accumulates to the upper section of the reactor mainly due to buoyance effect, while water drains down to the bottom of the reactor due to gravity. The parametric study on the fulids and thermal transport parameters (absolute permeability, k and HBS composite thermal conductivity, kθ) and the kinetic parameter (K°) concluded that the gas production process is predominated controlled by thermal and kinetic reaction paramters, while flow paramters does not play a significant role in the current smallscale reactor.

Although there are some general rules about the applicability of these fracture models, there are no guidelines for the a-priori selection of an appropriate model — generally, the fracture model is selected based on the preference and/or familiarity of the person performing the modeling, rather than some \"more technical\" criteria. In that light, this work presents an effort to provide guidance for fracture model suitability for cases from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Three Forks, and Wolfcamp formations. In this work, production data from multiple wells in the aforementioned reservoirs are history-matched using models commonly available in commercial reservoir simulators. We evaluate the ability of the equivalent continuum model (ECM), the dual porosity, the dual permeability, and the multiple interactive continuum model (MINC) to represent these wells. We determine that a correlation exists between the choice of the fracture model and the reservoir. However, the results of the study do not provide a sufficiently strong indication of model superiority which would support authoritative guidelines about applicability for a particular reservoir. Ultimately the choice of the most representative model depends on the particular well. The proposed recommendationsprovide guidance onthe appropriate fracture model to represent the studied reservoirs, thus enhancing their usefulness in the completion design process and the evaluation and prediction of production.

                    "abstract": "The understanding of proppant transport in fractures plays a critical role in estimating propped fracture dimensions and performance. Modeling of such processes is challenging because of the complex interactions between fluid, proppant particles and fracture geometry. Existing models generally assume vertical planar fracture geometry, whereas the reality in the subsurface maybe much more complex. In this study we use discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate that interactions between proppant particles and fracture side walls play an important role in proppant transport efficiency. To calibrate our numerical model, we conducted two validation simulations that describe particle settling tests and laboratory proppant transport experiments. Through scoping calculations, we determined the correct drag force model and matched both analytical solutions and experimental data for a wide range of flow regimes. We then constructed two hydraulic fracture simulation domains, one with a vertical planar fracture (as a base case), and the other with an inclined planar hydraulic fracture. In the main component of our study, we conducted proppant transport simulations using our benchmarked models in both domains and compared the proppant distribution results. By analyzing the velocity and trajectory of proppant particles during transport, we identified two different stages of the proppant transport process - a \"suspension\" stage and a \"settling\" stage. During the suspension stage, fluid drag and gravitational forces dominate, driving proppants further into the fracture. When the proppants collide with existing proppants dunes, the proppant particles lose momentum and become \"settled.\" Our results show that settled proppant are more difficult to be mobilized by fluid drag force, for the reason that kinetic energy is easily dissipated inside proppant dunes. Finally, we observed that proppant settles slower in inclined planar fractures, due to the supporting force from fracture side walls cancelling part of the gravitational force which act on the particle. This leads to a better proppant placement efficiency in inclined fractures. The objective of this work is to provide a better understanding of proppant transport behavior in inclined planar fractures by means of numerical simulation. A significant difference from prior (laboratory) experiments is the capability of our model to simulate proppant transport at field-scale flowrates. Such acapability is critical in understanding proppant transport and appropriately designing it by ensuring that the correct Reynolds number and flow regime are used in the design calculations. "

While the theory has been shown to converge to continuum mechanics in the theoretical limit, its behavior as a discrete numerical approximation with respect to classic problems has not been shown. In this study, we use standard analytical solutions to thoroughly test the numerical accuracy and rate of convergence of the spatial discretization obtained by peridynamics. We analyze the accuracy and rate of convergence of three different peridynamic constitutive responses: of these, two involve a state-based dilation, and the third is based on the estimation of the deformation gradient. Additionally, we study the choice of the peridynamic influence function in each of the constitutive responses. The peridynamic materials are solved in the linear elastic regime by solving a linear system of equations obtained by symbolically differentiating the force states. We test the methods against standard constant-strain solutions for uniaxial compression, isotropic compression, and simple shear. We also apply the methods to a finite material with a pressurized thin crack, using the Westergaard’s solution method to obtain an analytical displacement field for comparison. The two dilation-based peridynamic constitutive responses are found to only converge to one of the constant strain solutions, while the deformation gradient-based law converges in all cases with an appropriate choice of the influence functions. We show that a cubic influence function is the best choice of those considered in all methods. Only the deformation gradient-based model converges for all three linear deformation problems, but is less accurate than the dilation-based models for the thin crack problem because of instabilities. We demonstrate an ad hoc smoothing technique based on the influence function that is able to alleviate these instabilities and improve the accuracy of the deformation gradient-based model. "

However, the physically realistic simulation of mixed-hydrate simulation is not yet a fully solved problem.

In this work, we present a set of fast parametric relationships describing the thermodynamic properties and phase behavior of a mixed methane-carbon dioxide hydrate system. We use well-known, off-the-shelf hydrate physical properties packages to generate a sufficiently large dataset, select the most convenient and efficient mathematical forms, and fit the data to those forms to create a physical properties package suitable for inclusion in the TOUGH+ family of codes. The mapping of the phase and thermodynamic space reveals the complexity of the mixed-hydrate system and allows understanding of the thermodynamics at a level beyond what much of the existing laboratory data and literature currently offer.

                    "abstract": "This study investigates at high resolutions the system behavior caused by water invasion/imbibition during the short period of hydraulic fracturing in ultra-low permeability gas reservoirs, and during the subsequent long-term production period. The main objective is to assess the impact of this early water invasion/imbibition on the flow, fate and recovery of fluids during short- and long-term production from such reservoirs. The study accounts for all known flow and thermophysical processes and uses very fine discretization in order to capture the non-isothermal multi-scale system behavior in sufficient resolution. It focuses on two of the four general types of fractured systems (Types I and II), and describes complex processes and phenomena on length scales that cover the mm- to 15 m range. The high pressure during hydraulic fracturing, coupled with the generally low initial water saturation of such media, cause water imbibition into the matrix, with significant effects on the fluid flow behavior in this region. All key variables (pressure, temperature, phase saturations and relative permeabilities, capillary pressure, etc.) are monitored over time, and the effect on the fluid production rates is analyzed. The results of the study indicate that penetration of water into the matrix during hydraulic fracturing depends on the type of the fractured system. Flow in the fractures of Type II systems is fast, but water flow and redistribution into the matrix is slow and continues for a long time after the end of hydraulic fracturing, and water evaporation during production may have a significant impact. The phase saturations and relative permeabilities exhibit a complex behavior and vary both spatially and temporally in the matrix (Types I and II) and in the fractures (Type II). Gas production exhibits a complex behavior that is affected by both the evolving relative permeability to gas and the changing pressure and temperature regime. The magnitude of water injection/recovery volumes and the recovery pattern appear to be indicator of the type of reservoir fractured system. "

                    "abstract": "Oil shale, which is composed of abundant organic matter called kerogen, is a vast energy source. Pyrolysis of kerogen in oil shales releases recoverable hydrocarbons. Here, we describe the pyrolysis of kerogen with an in-situ upgrading process, which is applicable to the majority of oil shales. The pyrolysis is represented by six kinetic reactions resulting in 10 components and four phases. Expanding the Texas A&M Flow and Transport Simulator (FTSim), which is a variant of the TOUGH+simulator (Moridis 2014), we develop a fully functional capability that describes kerogen pyrolysis and accompanying system changes. The simulator describes the coupled process of mass transport and heat flow through porous and fractured media and includes physical and chemical phenomena of reservoir systems. The simulator involves a total of 15 thermophysical states and all transitions between them and computes a simultaneous solution of 11 mass- and energy-balance equations per element. The simulator solves the equations in a fully implicit manner by solving Jacobian matrix equations with the Newton-Raphson iteration method. To conduct a realistic simulation, we account for geological structure of oil-shale reservoirs and physical properties of bulk-oil shale rocks by considering phases and components in the pores. In addition, we involve interaction between fluids and porous media, diverse equations of state (EOSs) for computation of fluid properties, and numerical modeling of fractured media. We intensively reproduce the field-production data of Shell In-situ Conversion Process (ICP) implemented in the Green River formation by conducting sensitivity analyses for the diverse reservoir parameters, such as initial effective porosity of the matrix, oil-shale grade, and the spacing of the natural-fracture network. We analyze the effect of each reservoir parameter on the hydrocarbon productivity and product selectivity. The simulator provides a powerful tool to quantitatively evaluate production behavior and dynamic-system changes during in-situ upgrading of oil shales and subsequent fluid production by thoroughly describing a reservoir model, phases and components, phase behavior, phase properties, and evolution of porosity and permeability.

                    "title": "Impact of Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid Damage on Shale Gas Well Production Performance",
                    "abstract": "Much work has been done to accurately simulate shale gas production using horizontal well with hydraulic fractures. In general, these numerical studies have considered single-phase gas transport. However, following the fracturing, fluid-wall interactions can form a damaged zone nearby the fracture characterized by strong capillarity and osmosis effects. To understand the impact of fracturing fluid damage to well production performance, we present a new reservoir multi-phase flow model which includes these mechanisms of formation damage. In the simulation model, the shale matrix by the fracture is treated as a multi-scale porosity medium including interconnected organic, inorganic slit-shaped, and interlayer clay porosity fields. Prior to fracturing, the matrix holds the gas in the organic and the inorganic pore network, the water in the inorganic and the clay. Imbibition and osmosis mechanisms are included into an existing multi-scale advective-diffusive flow model to describe water-shale interactions following the fracturing. The reservoir flow simulator is fully implicit and based on the integral finite difference method. The simulation results show that, although fracturing is a rapid process, fluid-wall interactions continuing after fracturing could lead to important imbibition effect during the flowback and production, which allows water to penetrate into the inorganic pore network and displace the gas in-place near the fracture. Osmosis, on the other hand, takes part in the clay interlayer pores due to salt concentration difference between the fracturing fluid and the clay water, because clay in shale matrix acts as a semi-permeable membrane. This leads to pressure build-up in the clay interlayer pores. The pressure build-up, known as clay swelling pressure, exerts additional pressure into the shale matrix which can lead to significant permeability damage during the flowback and production. We measured the propagation speeds of the pressure waves associated with the capillarity and the osmosis. The new model is used to demonstrate the damage zone formation characteristics and its effect on the flowback dynamics. We also investigated effects of varying salinity contrast between the fracturing fluid and structural water, of varying clay content/type on the shale gas well production performance. Finally, the stress-dependence of the inorganic matrix permeability in the damaged zone is investigated. The new shale gas reservoir flow simulation model includes additional mechanisms that will allow the practicing engineer to gain insight into a particular case of production in the presence of water-shale interactions. The model can also be implemented into a simulation-based optimization process to design hydraulic-fracturing and flowback procedures for optimal gas production. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: We modeled microearthquakes (MEQs) for tensile failure of vertical fracture propagation by combining geophysics, flow, and geomechanics simulators while accounting for poromechanical effects. Each time fracturing occurred, we calculated the seismic moment tensor from the obtained displacement field and newly fractured area. Then, using this information, we modeled intensity, location, number of the events, and time of MEQs. We simulated various scenarios, taking single phase flow (i.e., water) in order to remove complex responses from multiphase flow. We first studied a synthetic reservoir having one single shale layer with two strong bounding layers and a horizontal well. The simulated MEQs reflected the propagation of the hydraulic fracture, where the magnitudes of most MEQs were between -1 and -3. Then, we simulated a vertical well in the more realistic geological model of the Arch Forth-Worth Basin, where the Barnett shale is located. We studied two scenarios: one in which the fluid was injected into the Lower Barnett shale and it only fractured into the injected layer, and one in which there was fluid migration from the injection point into the Upper Barnett Shale. The magnitudes of MEQ for these two scenarios were similar and mostly between -0.75 and 0.75 in strength. For all cases, the event locations of MEQs corresponded to the fracture propagation. Thus, the forward simulation of microearthquakes can be a useful to detect propagation of hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume. Additionally, we showed that under some reservoir conditions it is possible for fluid to fracture layers above the injection point without fracturing the targeted layer. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the energy industry for the last decade. This process entails pumping large amounts of sand and water down a well, where the increase in pressure creates a network of fractures that allow petroleum engineers to access trapped hydrocarbons. The operation is poorly understood, so the development of successful hydraulic fracturing methods has been too often a trial and error process. This poses monetary and environmental risks, and a general sense of mistrust towards the oil and gas industry. However, the basics of hydraulic fracturing dictates that a large planar fracture is created in a direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress. In addition to this, a significant number of shear failures (micro-earthquakes) are generated in the surrounding intact reservoir rock [1]. Furthermore, depending on the reservoir on which it is performed, hydraulic fracturing can cause fault reactivation and shear slip of existing natural fractures [2, 3]. The simultaneous combination of these phenomena makes the physics of the problem a difficult subject to study. Nevertheless, because the failure induced by perturbation of fluid pressure implies strong interaction between flow and geomechanics [4], we employed a coupled simulator to accurately predict and assess any risk derived from hydraulic fracturing a vertical well.

                    "title": "Numerical Investigation of Potential Cement Failure along the Wellbore and Gas Leak during Hydraulic Fracturing of Shale Gas Reservoirs",
                    "abstract": "Abstract: We investigated wellbore stability during hydraulic fracturing using the Mohr-Coulomb failure model and an intrinsic permeability step function for failure status. In order to assess the risk of failure, we varied the values of bottom-hole pressure, permeability multipliers for our permeability step function, and the cohesion values between the well casing and the surrounding cement to represent different quality levels of the cementing operation. Additionally, we studied shear failure for a homogeneous and a heterogeneous three shale layer reservoir. From numerical results, higher bottom-hole pressures increased the fracture propagation speed because it implied higher geomechanical loading. Furthermore, a higher permeability multiplier leads to a larger failed zone because higher permeabilities pressurize the failed zone faster. Also, simulations showed that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality. On the other hand, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and the evolution of long fractures along the vertical well, where they become a factor for potential contamination of aquifers. Moreover, simulations of heterogeneous shale reservoir showed how mechanical properties of the reservoir rock can help resist shear failure of the wellbore. Finally, a coupling strength sensitivity analysis of the steel-cement interface layer demonstrated that higher coupling strengths induce shear failure. Thus, high-quality cement, complete cementing, strong formation rock properties along the vertical well, and low poromechanical effects between fluid and geomechanics appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and contamination hazards to water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing. Introduction The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract enormous quantities of natural gas from previously thought uneconomic reservoirs [1], making shale gas production an important energy resource of the future [2, 3]. However, the extreme low permeability of the shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing to enhance productivity [4, 5]. At the same time, environmental impacts induced by hydraulic fracturing have been raised, for example, contamination of ground water, unstable growth of hydraulic fractures, seismic risks, reactivation of existing faults, and soil contamination due to proppant chemicals [6]. The potential environmental impacts have had a negative influence on public opinion, which is curbing and even halting the American shale gas revolution in its tracks. Dusseault et al. (2001) [7] studied compaction-induced shear failure of vertical wells by fluid production. Shear failure is one of the typical mechanisms of well instability. Incomplete cementing between the well and reservoir formations is considered one of the highest environmental risks of ground water contamination, as well as a catalyst for wellbore failure [6, 8]. Pressurization at the bottom of the well causes high shear stress along the vertical well and can result in shear slip at the contacting area between the well casing and the cemented zone if the contacting area is poorly cemented. Cracks from shear failure along the well can be a potential pathway connecting deep shale gas reservoirs to shallow aquifers with higher permeability. "

                    "abstract": "Shale reservoirs play an important role as a future energy resource of the United States. Numerous studies were performed to describe the storage and transport of hydrocarbons through ultra-small pores in the shale reservoirs. Most of these studies were developed by modifying techniques used for conventional reservoirs. The common pore-sized distribution of the shale reservoirs is approximately 1 to 20 nm and in such confined spaces that the interactions between the wall of the container (i.e., the shale and kerogen) and the contained fluids (i.e., the hydrocarbon fluids and water) may exert significant influence on the localized phase behavior. We believe this is because the orientation and distribution of fluid molecules in the confined space are different from those of the bulk fluid, causing changes in the localized thermodynamic properties. This study provides a detailed account of the changes of pressure/volume/temperature properties and phase behavior (specifically, the phase diagrams) in a synthetic shale reservoir for pure hydrocarbons (methane and ethane) and a simple methane/ethane (binary) mixture. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed to study the effect of confinement on the fluid properties. A graphite slab made of two layers is used to represent kerogen in the shale reservoirs. The separation between the two layers, representing a kerogen pore, is varied from 1 to 10 nm to observe the changes of the hydrocarbon-fluid properties. In this paper, the critical properties of methane and ethane as well as the methane/ethane mixture phase diagrams in different pore sizes are derived from the GCMC simulations. In addition, the GCMC simulations are used to investigate the deviations of the fluid densities in the confined space from those of the bulk fluids at reservoir conditions. Although not investigated in this work, such deviations may indicate that significant errors for production forecasting and reserves estimation in shale reservoirs may occur if the (typical) bulk densities are used in reservoir-engineering calculations.

The simulation results show that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality. Conversely, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and evolution of long fractures/cracks along the vertical well. Specifically, low cohesion between the well and cemented areas can cause significant shear failure along the well, while high cohesion does not cause shear failure. The Biot and thermal dilation coefficients strongly affect shear failure along the well casing, and low Young's modulus causes fast failure propagation. Still, for the high quality of the cementing job, failure propagates very little. When the hydraulic fracturing pressure is high or when permeability increases significantly, low cohesion of the cement can cause fast propagation of shear failure and of the resulting fracture/crack, but a high-quality cement with no weak zones exhibits limited shear failure that is only concentrated near the bottom of the vertical part of the well. Thus, high-quality cement and complete cementing along the vertical well appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and, consequently, against contamination hazards to drinking water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing operations.

From the numerical simulation, we find that tensile fracturing occurs discontinuously in time, which generates saw-toothed responses of pressure, the fracture aperture, and displacement, and that fracture propagation is sensitive to factors such as initial condition of saturation, a type of the injection fluid, heterogeneity, tensile strength, elastic moduli, and permeability models. Gas injection induces faster fracturing in shale gas reservoirs than water injection, for the same mass injection, because of high mobility of gas. However, water injection to highly water-saturated formations can contribute to fast pressurization and high mobility of water, resulting in large fracturing. For moderate initial water saturation, complex physical responses within the fracture result from strong nonlinear permeability and multiphase flow with gravity. Pressure diffusion and pressurization within the fracture are also affected by permeability. High intrinsic and high relative permeabilities result in fast fluid movement of injected fluid, followed by fast fracturing. High Young׳s modulus and high Poisson׳s ratio do not seem favorable to fracture propagation, although they are not significantly sensitive. For heterogeneity, a geological layer of high strength between near surface and above the shale gas reservoirs can prevent vertical fracture propagation, changing the direction of fracturing horizontally.

We simulated a case in which a horizontal injection well intersects a steeply dipping fault, with hydraulic fracturing channeled within the fault, during a 3-h hydraulic fracturing stage. Consistent with field observations, the simulation results show that shale-gas hydraulic fracturing along faults does not likely induce seismic events that could be felt on the ground surface, but rather results in numerous small microseismic events, as well as aseismic deformations along with the fracture propagation. The calculated seismic moment magnitudes ranged from about −2.0 to 0.5, except for one case assuming a very brittle fault with low residual shear strength, for which the magnitude was 2.3, an event that would likely go unnoticed or might be barely felt by humans at its epicenter. The calculated moment magnitudes showed a dependency on injection depth and fault dip. We attribute such dependency to variation in shear stress on the fault plane and associated variation in stress drop upon reactivation. Our simulations showed that at the end of the 3-h injection, the rupture zone associated with tensile and shear failure extended to a maximum radius of about 200 m from the injection well. The results of this modeling study for steeply dipping faults at 1000 to 2500 m depth is in agreement with earlier studies and field observations showing that it is very unlikely that activation of a fault by shale-gas hydraulic fracturing at great depth (thousands of meters) could cause felt seismicity or create a new flow path (through fault rupture) that could reach shallow groundwater resources.

As part of a long-term investigation of producing gas from methane hydrate, lab-scale gas production tests have been performed using natural cores from India's Natural Gas Hydrate Program 01 Expedition (NGHP-01), and from the Mount Elbert Stratigraphic Well on the North Slope, of Alaska. Prior to performing the gas production tests, a number of cores from the NGHP-01 were scanned using X-ray computed tomography (CT) to examine the gas hydrate-bearing sediment structure, which guided the selection of the core for the gas production test. Disseminated gas hydrate, gas hydrate in veins, and gas hydrate in nodules were observed or inferred from the CT data. Data from numerous core segments are presented here and in the supplemental information. In our gas production test, the gas hydrate in the NGHP-01 core was dissociated by warming the core to above the stability point, and then depressurizing the sample. A preserved sample of gas hydrate-bearing sandstone from the Mount Elbert Test Well was dissociated by depressurization. In both tests, the internal temperature of the sample was monitored in two locations and the density changes at high spatial resolution were measured using X-ray CT scanning. Although there were indications of dissociation in the NGHP-01 core, no gas was produced. The Mount Elbert sample contained two distinct regions having different porosity and grain size distributions. The gas hydrate dissociation occurred initially throughout the sample as a result of lowering the pressure below methane hydrate stability conditions. This initial depressurization stage in the experiment reduced the temperature to the methane hydrate equilibrium point, and the pressure was controlled so that the temperature remained above the ice point. After that, dissociation occurred from the outside into the core sample as a result of heat transfer from the controlled temperature bath surrounding the pressure vessel. Numerical modeling of the laboratory test results using TOUGH + HYDRATE yielded a gas production curve that closely matches the experimentally measured curve. "

                    "abstract": "We investigate coupled flow and geomechanics in gas production from extremely low-permeability reservoirs such as tight- and shale-gas reservoirs, using dynamic porosity and permeability during numerical simulation. In particular, we take the intrinsic permeability as a step function of the status of material failure, and the permeability is updated every timestep. We consider gas reservoirs with the vertical and horizontal primary fractures, using the single- and dynamic double-porosity (dual-continuum) models. We modify the multiple-porosity constitutive relations for modeling the double porous continua for flow and geomechanics. The numerical results indicate that the production of gas causes redistribution of the effective-stress fields, increasing the effective shear stress and resulting in plasticity. Shear failure occurs not only near the fracture tips but also away from the primary fractures, which indicates generation of secondary fractures. These secondary fractures increase the permeability significantly, and change the flow pattern, which, in turn, causes a change in the distribution of geomechanical variables. From various numerical tests, we find that shear failure is enhanced by a large pressure drop at the production well, a high Biot's coefficient, and low frictional and dilation angles. Smaller spacing between the horizontal wells also contributes to faster secondary fracturing. When the dynamic double-porosity model is used, we observe a faster evolution of the enhanced-permeability areas than that obtained from the single-porosity model, mainly because of a higher permeability of the fractures in the double-porosity model. These complicated physics for stress-sensitive reservoirs cannot properly be captured by the uncoupled or flow-only simulation, and, thus, tightly coupled flow and geomechanical models are highly recommended to describe accurately the reservoir behavior during gas production in tight- and shale-gas reservoirs and to design production scenarios smartly.

                    "abstract": "This paper introduces a fully coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics solver that can be applied to modeling highly heterogeneous porous media. Multiphase flow in deformable porous media is a multiphysics problem that considers the flow physics and rock physics simultaneously. To model this problem, the multiphase flow equations and geomechanical equilibrium equation must be tightly coupled. Conventional finite element modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics does not conserve mass locally since it uses continuous basis functions. Mixed finite element discretization that satisfies local mass conservation of the flow equation can be a good solution for this problem. In addition, the stabilized finite element method for discretizing the saturation equation minimizes numerical diffusion and provides better resolution of saturation solution. In this work, we developed a coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics solver that solves fully coupled governing equations, namely pressure, velocity, saturation, and geomechanical equilibrium equations. The solver can deal with full tensor permeability and elastic stiffness for modeling a highly heterogeneous reservoir system. The results of the numerical experiments are very encouraging. We used the solver to simulate a reservoir system that has very heterogeneous permeability and elastic stiffness fields and found that the numerical solution captures the complex multiphysics of the system. In addition, we obtained higher resolution of saturation solution than with the conventional finite volume discretization. This would help us make a better estimate of the numerical solution of complex multiphysics problems. "

                    "abstract": "Shale reservoirs play an important role as a future energy resource of the United States.  Numerous studies have been performed to describe the storage and transport of hydrocarbons through ultra-small pores in the shale reservoirs.  Most of these studies were developed by modifying techniques used for conventional reservoirs.  The common pore size distribution of the shale reservoirs is approximately 1-20 nm and in such confined spaces the interactions between the wall of the container (i.e., the shale and kerogen) and the contained fluids (i.e., the hydrocarbon fluids and water) may exert significant influence on the localized phase behavior.  We believe this is due to the fact that the orientation and distribution of fluid molecules in the confined space are different from those of the bulk fluid; causing changes in the localized thermodynamic properties. This study provides a detailed account of the changes of PVT properties and phase behavior (specifically, the phase diagrams) in a synthetic shale reservoir for pure hydrocarbons (methane and ethane) and a simple methane-ethane (binary) mixture.  Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed to study the effect of confinement on the fluid properties.  A graphite slab made of two layers is used to represent kerogen in the shale reservoirs.  The separation between the two layers, representing a kerogen pore, is varied from 1 nm to 10 nm to observe the changes of the hydrocarbon fluid properties.  In this paper, the critical properties of methane and ethane as well as the methane-ethane mixture phase diagrams in different pore sizes are derived from the GCMC simulations.  In addition, the GCMC simulations are used to investigate the deviations of the fluid densities in the confined space from those of the bulk fluids at reservoirs conditions.  While not investigated in this work, such deviations may indicate that significant errors for production forecasting and reserve estimation in shale reservoirs may occur if the (typical) bulk densities are used in reservoir engineering calculations. Introduction Over the past decade, the main focus of the petroleum industry has to develop the technology exploit shale reservoirs.  Unlike conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs, shale reservoirs have unique rock properties — in particular, ultra-low in-situ permeabilities (on the order of 1-100 nd is very common).  Shale reservoirs contain nano-scale sized pores, which leads to the ultra-low permeabilities, but also some very unusual phase behavior caused by \"confinement\" in very small pores. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to extract hydrocarbon fluids from shale reservoirs without substantial \"stimulation\" of the formation, and the current favored model is that of the multi-fractured horizontal well.  The ultra-low permeability nature of these reservoirs, combined with the requirement of significant reservoir stimulation to achieve commercial flowrates has led to the descriptor of \"unconventional reservoirs\" for shale gas and liquids-rich shale reservoirs. As noted, numerous studies have been performed to describe the storage and transport of hydrocarbons in shale reservoirs; in particular to improve reserves estimation and production forecasts.  Desorption-adsorption models (e.g., the Langmuir model) are added in numerical reservoir simulation and gas-in-place calculation to account for adsorbed gas in shales (Shabro et al. 2011; Ambrose et al. 2011; Ambrose et al. 2012; Das et al.).  In ultra-small pores, turbulent flow may develop and cause deviation from the conventional models (i.e., Darcy's equation).  Knudsen's number is used to characterize slip and no-slip flow and Knudsen diffusion and slip flow models are incorporated to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation (Freeman 2010; Shabro et al. 2011; Darabi et al. 2012, Fathi et al. 2012).  However, most of these studies were developed by modifying techniques used for conventional reservoirs — only a few of these studies consider the fundamental effects of pore size on hydrocarbon PVT properties and flow behavior (i.e., storage and transport of fluids).

Recently, the slot-drill (SD) completion technique was proposed as an alternative treatment method in such formations (Carter 2009). This paper documents the results of a comprehensive numerical-simulation study conducted to evaluate the production performance of the SD technique and compare its performance to that of the standard MSHF approach. We investigated three low-permeability formations of interest--namely, a shale-gas formation, a tight-gas formation, and a tight/shale-oil formation. The simulation domains were discretized with Voronoi-gridding schemes to create representative meshes of the different reservoir and completion systems modeled in this study. The results from this study indicated that the SD method does not, in general, appear to be competitive in terms of reservoir performance and recovery compared with the more traditional MSHF method. Our findings indicate that the larger surface area to flow that results from the application of MSHF is much more significant than the higher conductivity achieved by use of the SD technique. However, there may exist cases, for example, lack of adequate water volumes for hydraulic fracturing, or very high irreducible water saturation that leads to adverse relative permeability conditions and production performance, in which the low-cost SD method may make production feasible from an otherwise challenging (if not inaccessible) resource.

Mesh generation needs to trend toward ever more general applications. To that end, we have developed MeshVoro, a tool that is based on the Voro++ (Chris H. Rycroft, 2009. Chaos 19, 041111) library and is capable of generating complex three-dimensional Voronoi tessellation-based (unstructured) meshes for the solution of problems of flow and transport in subsurface geologic media that are addressed by the TOUGH (Pruess, K., Oldenburg C., Moridis G., 1999. Report LBNL-43134, 582. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA) family of codes. MeshVoro, which includes built-in data visualization routines, is a particularly useful tool because it extends the applicability of the TOUGH family of codes by enabling the scientifically robust and relatively easy discretization of systems with challenging 3D geometries. We describe several applications of MeshVoro. We illustrate the ability of the tool to straightforwardly transform a complex geological grid into a simulation mesh that conforms to the specifications of the TOUGH family of codes. We demonstrate how MeshVoro can describe complex system geometries with a relatively small number of grid blocks, and we construct meshes for geometries that would have been practically intractable with a standard Cartesian grid approach. We also discuss the limitations and appropriate applications of this new technology. "

                    "abstract": "Production of low-viscosity liquids (including condensates) from tight reservoirs (such as shales) is severely restricted by the ultra low-permeability of such formations, limiting production to a very small fraction (usually less than 5 percent) of the liquids-in-place. In this study, which is part of a wider investigation, we evaluate by means of numerical simulation several possible strategies to enhance low-viscosity liquids production from such reservoirs. These strategies include (a) physical displacement processes, (b) non-thermal processes to reduce the viscosity and the critical saturation of the liquids, (c) thermal processes, (d) enhanced reservoir stimulation, (e) novel well configurations and (f) combinations thereof. The objectives of this effort are to (1) to remove from further consideration potential production strategies that hold limited (if any) promise, and (2) to identify production strategies that appear to have potential for further study and development. We first determine the baseline production performance of such reservoirs corresponding to several reference production regimes that involve minimal or no reservoir stimulation, standard displacement fluids (H2O or CH4), standard well configurations and no thermal treatment. We then evaluate the efficiency of several production strategies: (a) traditional continuous gas flooding using parallel horizontal wells and using the currently abundant shale gas, (b) water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding, (c) huff-and-puff injection/production strategies using lean gas/rich gas in a traditional (single) horizontal well with multiple fractures, (d) flooding using appropriate gases (e.g., CO2, N2, CH4) using appropriate well configurations (mainly horizontal), with the viscosity reduction resulting from the gas dissolution into the liquids, and (e) thermal processes, in which the viscosity reduction is achieved by heating, possibly to the point of liquid vaporization and transport through the matrix to the production wells as a gas. Our study includes an analysis of the sensitivity of the liquids production to the main parameters defining each of the strategies listed above in an effort to determine the critically important parameters and factors that control the production performance and efficiency.

We study the system response at two time scales: a short period (14 days) that corresponds to the duration of the planned field test, and a prolonged production period that continues to the point of hydrate exhaustion and/or reservoir abandonment. The data describing the geologic model and the system properties were obtained from earlier geophysical studies and the analysis of cores obtained from experimental wells at several locations in the Ulleung Basin. Gas hydrate accumulations at this site typically occur in deep water (2157 m) but close to the ocean floor (with their tops 140 mbsf), and are usually characterized by alternating mud (nearly hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis of the short-term production tests focuses on the expected gas production rate and the possibility of subsidence during the limited time of the planned test. The long-term study aims to address the issue of feasibility of long-term production from the hydrates at the test site in terms of production rates and the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. We investigate several well operation regimes. We evaluate the sensitivity of the system to various flow, thermal, and geomechanical properties, and we account for the interdependence of flow and geomechanical properties. We estimate possible subsidence under production and we determine the conditions that have the potential to lead to wellbore and formation failure, thus defining the envelope of well operations and production conditions that maximize safe gas production.

                    "abstract": "Oil shale, an organic-rich sedimentary rock, is an abundant energy resource in the United States. Because few oil shale deposits occur in shallow formations, application of an in-situ process is necessary for thermal decomposition and subsequent oil and gas production. An earlier investigation indicated that cylindrical or planar in-situ electric heaters were more efficient than flowing superheated steam through created fractures. This study investigates the efficiency of a steam-soak (huff-and-puff) process instead of heating with a continuous steam flow stream. There are challenges in the thorough description of in-situ upgrading process because the kerogen decomposition involves of a series of complex and sensitive reactions, and results a large number of fluid and solid products. Expanding the Flow and Transport Simulator (FTSim), we developed a fully implicit capability that describes the decomposition of kerogen in the oil shale and the resulting system changes with minimal simplification and assumptions. The decomposition process is represented by 6 kinetic reactions (resulting in 10 components and 4 phases), involves coupled processes of mass transport and heat flow, and accurately accounts for phase equilibrium and phase transition thermodynamics. We applied our simulator to find a successful strategy for hydrocarbon production using steam that flows in vertical fractures created by multistage transverse fracturing in a horizontal (MTFH) well. In the first stage (injection) of the process, superheated steam is first injected into the hydraulic fractures heating the oil shale. In the second stage (production), steam injection ceases, and oil and gas from the kerogen decomposition are produced after a “rest” period. The energy efficiency associated with this huff-and-puff procedure is higher than that obtained when the formation is heated continuously. We analyzed the sensitivity of production to the duration of the injection and production phases, the fracture length, the fracture spacing, and the position and penetration of the injection and production wells. The ability of our simulator to describe fluid and heat flow inside the fractures and the matrix of the system allows the evaluation of diverse factors affecting productivity and energy efficiency that are essential for the optimization of in-situ upgrading process of oil shales.

The RealGasH2O EOS option describes the non-isothermal two-phase flow of water and a real gas mixture in gas reservoirs, with a particular focus in ultra-tight (such as tight-sand and shale gas) reservoirs. The gas mixture is treated as either a single-pseudo-component having a fixed composition, or as a multicomponent system composed of up to 9 individual real gases. The RealGas option has the same general capabilities, but does not include water, thus describing a single-phase, dry-gas system. In addition to the standard capabilities of all members of the TOUGH+ family of codes (fully-implicit, compositional simulators using both structured and unstructured grids), the capabilities of the two codes include coupled flow and thermal effects in porous and/or fractured media, real gas behavior, inertial (Klinkenberg) effects, full micro-flow treatment, Darcy and non-Darcy flow through the matrix and fractures of fractured media, single- and multi-component gas sorption onto the grains of the porous media following several isotherm options, discrete and fracture representation, complex matrix–fracture relationships, and porosity–permeability dependence on pressure changes. The two options allow the study of flow and transport of fluids and heat over a wide range of time frames and spatial scales not only in gas reservoirs, but also in problems of geologic storage of greenhouse gas mixtures, and of geothermal reservoirs with multi-component condensable (H2O and CH4) and non-condensable gas mixtures. The codes are verified against available analytical and semi-analytical solutions. Their capabilities are demonstrated in a series of problems of increasing complexity, ranging from isothermal flow in simpler 1D and 2D conventional gas reservoirs, to non-isothermal gas flow in 3D fractured shale gas reservoirs involving 4 types of fractures, micro-flow, non-Darcy flow and gas composition changes during production.

The T+M simulator can model the initial fracture development during the hydraulic fracturing operations, after which the domain description changes from single continuum to double or multiple continua in order to rigorously model both flow and geomechanics for fracture–rock matrix systems. The T+H simulator provides two-way coupling between fluid-heat flow and geomechanics, accounting for thermo-poro-mechanics, treats nonlinear permeability and geomechanical moduli explicitly, and dynamically tracks changes in the fracture(s) and in the pore volume. We also fully account for leak-off in all directions during hydraulic fracturing. We first test the T+M simulator, matching numerical solutions with the analytical solutions for poromechanical effects, static fractures, and fracture propagations. Then, from numerical simulation of various cases of the planar fracture propagation, shear failure can limit the vertical fracture propagation of tensile failure, because of leak-off into the reservoirs. Slow injection causes more leak-off, compared with fast injection, when the same amount of fluid is injected. Changes in initial total stress and contributions of shear effective stress to tensile failure can also affect formation of the fractured areas, and the geomechanical responses are still well-posed.

It is expected to result in a significant improvement in reserve estimates, and increases in production by increasing efficiency and reducing uncertainty. "

                    "abstract": "We investigate the feasibility of production from a marine hydrate accumulation that has the properties and conditions of the UBGH2-6 site at the Ulleung basin in the Korean East Sea. The 20 m-thick system is in deep water (2160 m) but close to the ocean floor (with its top at 140 mbsf), and is characterized by alternating mud (near hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis indicates that production from such a hydrate accumulation is feasible, but the production rates are generally modest. The production rate Qp peaks at about 1.45 ST m3/s=4.4 MMSCFD at about t=1 year, and continuously declines afterward. Sensitivity analysis indicates that cumulative production increases with a declining initial hydrate saturation, an increasing intrinsic permeability of the sand layers and an increasing thermal conductivity of the porous media, while the effect of porosity is non-monotonic: production initially increases with a decreasing porosity, but the trend is later reversed. However, the sensitivity to these parameters is limited, and does not alter the overall predictions of modest production potential. The geomechanical situation appears challenging, as significant subsidence (exceeding 3.5 m at a depth of 20 m below the sea floor, and 1.5 m at the top of the hydrate deposit) is estimated to occur along a large part of the wellbore, and yielding and failure within the 20 m-thick system are possible early in the production process. However, there is significant uncertainty in the predictions of the geomechanical system behavior because they are not based on measured system properties but only on estimates/assumptions from analogs.

                    "abstract": "Various analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical models have been proposed to characterize rate and pressure behavior as a function of time in tight gas and shale gas systems featuring horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fractures. Despite a few analytical models, as well as a small number of published numerical studies, there is currently little consensus regarding the large-scale flow behavior over time in such systems, particularly regarding the dominant flow regimes and whether or not reservoir properties or volumes can be estimated from well performance data. We constructed a fit-for-purpose numerical simulator which accounts for a variety of production features pertinent to these systems—specifically ultra-tight matrix permeability, hydraulically fractured horizontal wells with induced fractures of various configurations, multiple porosity and permeability fields, and desorption. These features cover the production mechanisms which are currently believed to be most relevant in tight gas and shale gas systems. We employ the numerical simulator to examine various tight gas and shale gas systems and to identify and illustrate the various flow regimes which progressively occur over time. We perform this study at fine grid discretization on the order of 1 mm near fractures to accurately capture flow effects at all time periods. We visualize the flow regimes using specialized plots of rate and pressure functions, as well as maps of pressure and sorption distributions. We use pressure maps to visualize the various flow regimes and their transitions in tight gas systems. In a typical tight gas system, we illustrate the initial linear flow into the hydraulic fractures (i.e., formation linear flow), transitioning to compound formation linear flow, and eventually transforming into elliptical flow. We explore variations of possible shale gas system models. Based on diffusive flow (with and without desorption), we show that due to the extremely low permeability of shale matrix (a few nanodarcies), the flow behavior is dominated by the extent of and configuration of the fractures. This work expands our understanding of flow behavior in tight gas and shale gas systems, where such an understanding may ultimately be used to estimate reservoir properties and reserves in these types of reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "We have conducted numerical simulation studies to assess the potential for injection-induced fault reactivation and notable seismic events associated with shale-gas hydraulic fracturing operations. The modeling is generally tuned toward conditions usually encountered in the Marcellus shale play in the Northeastern US at an approximate depth of 1500 m (~4500 ft). Our modeling simulations indicate that when faults are present, micro-seismic events are possible, the magnitude of which is somewhat larger than the one associated with micro-seismic events originating from regular hydraulic fracturing because of the larger surface area that is available for rupture. The results of our simulations indicated fault rupture lengths of about 10–20 m, which, in rare cases, can extend to over 100 m, depending on the fault permeability, the in situ stress field, and the fault strength properties. In addition to a single event rupture length of 10–20 m, repeated events and aseismic slip amounted to a total rupture length of 50 m, along with a shear offset displacement of less than 0.01 m. This indicates that the possibility of hydraulically induced fractures at great depth (thousands of meters) causing activation of faults and creation of a new flow path that can reach shallow groundwater resources (or even the surface) is remote. The expected low permeability of faults in producible shale is clearly a limiting factor for the possible rupture length and seismic magnitude. In fact, for a fault that is initially nearly-impermeable, the only possibility of a larger fault slip event would be opening by hydraulic fracturing; this would allow pressure to penetrate the matrix along the fault and to reduce the frictional strength over a sufficiently large fault surface patch. However, our simulation results show that if the fault is initially impermeable, hydraulic fracturing along the fault results in numerous small micro-seismic events along with the propagation, effectively preventing larger events from occurring. Nevertheless, care should be taken with continuous monitoring of induced seismicity during the entire injection process to detect any runaway fracturing along faults. "

                    "abstract": "Low to ultralow permeability formations require \"special\" treatments/stimulation to make them produce economical quantities of hydrocarbon and at the moment, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing (MSHF or MHF) is the most commonly used stimulation method for enhancing the exploitation of these reservoirs. Recently, the slot-drill (SD) completion technique was proposed as an alternative treatment method in such formations (Carter 2009). This paper documents the results of a comprehensive numerical simulation study conducted to evaluate the production performance of the SD technique and compare its performance to that of the standard MSHF approach. We investigated three low permeability formations of interest, namely a shale-gas, a tight-gas, and a tight/shale-oil formation. The simulation domains were discretized by using Voronoi gridding schemes to create representative meshes of the different reservoir and completion systems modeled in this study. The results from this study indicated that the SD method does not, in general, appear to be competitive in terms of reservoir performance and recovery compared to the more traditional MSHF method. Our findings indicate that the larger surface area to flow that results from the application of MSHF is much more significant than the higher conductivity achieved using the SD technique. However, there may exist cases, e.g., lack of adequate water volumes for hydraulic fracturing, or very high irreducible water saturation that leads to adverse relative permeability conditions and production performance, in which the low-cost SD method may make production feasible from an otherwise challenging (if not inaccessible) resource. Introduction Shale gas and other low/ultralow permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs have recently emerged as very important energy sources. Such reservoirs, which are often referred to as \"unconventional\" resources, have now become the hub of exploration and production (E&P) activities in several areas, but mainly in North America. As at 2005, more than 25 percent of the daily natural gas production in the United States was derived from unconventional reservoirs (Naik 2005). The SD is a completion technique that can be used to recover hydrocarbons from such low permeability reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "The exploitation of unconventional reservoirs complements the practice of hydraulic fracturing, and with an ever-increasing demand in energy, this practice is set to experience significant growth in the coming years. Sophisticated analytic models are needed to accurately describe fluid flow in a hydraulic fracture, and the problem has been approached from different directions in the past 3 decades--starting with the work of Gringarten et al. (1974) for an infinite-conductivity case, followed by contributions from Cinco-Ley et al. (1978), Lee and Brockenbrough (1986), Ozkan and Raghavan (1991), and Blasingame and Poe (1993) for a finite-conductivity case. This topic remains an active area of research and, for the more-complicated physical scenarios such as multiple transverse fractures in ultratight reservoirs, answers are currently being sought. Starting with the seminal work of Chang and Yortsos (1990), fractal theory has been successfully applied to pressure-transient testing, although with an emphasis on the effects of natural fractures in pressure/rate behavior. In this paper, we begin by performing a rigorous analytical and numerical study of the fractal diffusivity equation (FDE), and we show that it is more fundamental than the classic linear and radial diffusivity equations. Thus, we combine the FDE with the trilinear flow model (Lee and Brockenbrough 1986), culminating in a new semianalytic solution for flow in a finite-conductivity vertical fracture that we name the \"fractal-fracture solution (FFS).\" This new solution is instantaneous and comparable in accuracy with the Blasingame and Poe solution (1993). In addition, this is the first time that fractal theory is used in fluid flow in a porous medium to address a problem not related to reservoir heterogeneity. Ultimately, this project is a demonstration of the untapped potential of fractal theory; our approach is flexible, and we believe that the same methodology could be extended to different applications. One objective of this work is to develop a fast and accurate semianalytical solution for flow in a single vertical fracture that fully penetrates a homogeneous infinite-acting reservoir. This would be the first time that fractal theory is used to study a problem that is not related to naturally fractured reservoirs or reservoir heterogeneity. In addition, as part of the development process, we revisit the fundamentals of fractals in reservoir engineering and show that the underlying FDE possesses some interesting qualities that have not yet been comprehensively addressed in the literature.

In order to analyze coupled flow and geomechanics more rigorously we employ two-way coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, and compare the results with those from one-way coupling used in previous studies, where two-way coupling accounts for changes in pore volume induced by geomechanics, while one-way coupling does not. We find clear differences in the variables of flow and geomechanics between one-way and two-way couplings in this field case (e.g., pressure and effective stress). Using geomechanical properties used previously for the PBU-L 106 C unit, we find that the effective stresses are within the elastic region, located away from the Mohr–Coulomb yield function for both vertical and horizontal well production scenarios. This indicates that there is little danger in geomechanical instability and failure. We also investigate vertical displacement to assess well stability, using two-way coupling. The results from the vertical well scenario show small vertical displacement, from which we anticipate that the vertical well will be stable and safe. On the other hand, the horizontal well scenario causes larger subsidence for a given simulation time because of higher production rates. Even in the case that the hydrates are completely dissociated and the aqueous phase pressure is equilibrated with the constant bottom hole pressure, the estimates of the maximum vertical displacement and strain are 73 cm and 2%, respectively, which do not appear to be a danger of potential well failure. Based on the results and analyses, the horizontal well production is feasible for gas production from the hydrate layers of Unit C in the PBU-L 106 site. But the reservoir model used in this study is relatively generalized. Thus, a specific reservoir model for the site will be required for higher accuracy in the future, after we obtain accurately measured geomechanical data and failure models. "

                    "abstract": "We conducted numerical modeling of coupled multiphase fluid-flow, thermal, and geomechanical processes during gas production from an oceanic hydrate deposit to study the geomechanical performance and wellbore stability. We investigated two alternative cases of depressurization-induced gas production: (1) production from horizontal wells in a Class 3 deposit (a hydrate layer sandwiched between two low-permeability layers); and (2) production from vertical wells in a Class 2 deposit (a hydrate layer with an underlying zone of mobile water). The analysis showed that geomechanical responses around the wellbore are driven by reservoir-wide pressure depletion, which in turn, depends on production rate and pressure decline at the wellbore. The calculated vertical compaction of the relatively soft sediments and increased shear stress caused local yielding of the formation around the well assembly for both the horizontal and vertical well cases. However, the analysis also showed that the extent of the yield zone can be reduced if using overbalanced drilling (at an internal well pressure above the formation fluid pressure) and well completion that minimizes any annular gap between the well assembly and the formation. Our further analysis indicated that the most extensive yield zone would occur around the perforated production interval of a vertical well, where the pressure gradient is the highest. In the field, such yielding and shearing of the sediments could lead to enhanced sand production if not prevented with appropriate sand control technology. Moreover, our analysis shows that the vertical compaction of the reservoir can be substantial, with subsidence on the order of several meters and vertical compaction strain locally exceeding 10%. In the field, such substantial compaction strain will require appropriate well design (such as slip joints or heavy wall casing) to avoid tensile or buckling failure of the well assembly. "

                    "abstract": "Coupled flow and geomechanics play an important role in the analysis of gas-hydrate reservoirs under production. The stiffness of the rock skeleton and the deformation of the reservoir, as well as porosity and permeability, are directly influenced by (and interrelated with) changes in pressure and temperature and in fluid- (water and gas) and solid- (hydrate and ice) phase saturations. Fluid and solid phases may coexist, which, coupled with steep temperature and pressure gradients, results in strong nonlinearities in the coupled flow and mechanics processes, making the description of system behavior in dissociating hydrate deposits exceptionally complicated. In previous studies, the geological stability of hydrate-bearing sediments was investigated using one-way coupled analysis, in which the changes in fluid properties affect mechanics within the gas-hydrate reservoirs, but with no feedback from geomechanics to fluid flow. In this paper, we develop and test a rigorous two-way coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, in which the solutions from mechanics are reflected in the solution of the flow problem through the adjustment of affected hydraulic properties. We employ the fixed-stress split method, which results in a convergent sequential implicit scheme. In this study of several hydrate-reservoir cases, we find noticeable differences between the results from one- and two-way couplings. The nature of the elliptic boundary value problem of quasistatic mechanics results in instantaneous compaction or dilation over the domain through loading from reservoir-fluid production. This induces a pressure rise or drop at early times (low-pressure diffusion), and consequently changes the effective stress instantaneously, possibly causing geological instability. Additionally, the pressure and temperature regime affects the various phase saturations, the rock stiffness, porosity, and permeability, thus affecting the fluid-flow regime. These changes are not captured accurately by the simpler one-way coupling. The tightly coupled sequential approach we propose provides a rigorous, two-way coupling model that captures the interrelationship between geomechanical and flow properties and processes, accurately describes the system behavior, and can be readily applied to large-scale problems of hydrate behavior in geologic media.

In this study a huff-and-puff method is used to producing gas from the hydrate accumulation. We simulate numerically the hydrate dissociation and gas production by alternately injecting hot water and producing fluids at a vertical well. The simulations show the gas production rate in huff-and-puff operations is very small (50–140 m3/d), and unacceptable for commercial production. The calculation also indicated secondary hydrates forms at the very early period of injecting operations, and then gas is released due to the thermal stimulation of hot water, but the amount of released gas in the injection periods of hot water is much smaller than that converts into secondary hydrates. In the production operations, much of gas is released from the hydrates due to a small depressurization at the well, but the released gas can not produce effectively due to the small pressure gradient, and thus remains in the reservoir and converts into secondary hydrates in the next operation of injecting hot water. The study provides an insight into the production potential of the Shenhu hydrate accumulations through the huff-and-puff method, and a basis for the analysis of the economic feasibility of gas production from that area.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Various models featuring horizontal wells with multiple fractures have been proposed to characterize flow behavior over time in tight and shale gas systems. Currently, only very little is known about the effects of nonideal fracture patterns and coupled primary-secondary fracture interactions on reservoir performance in unconventional gas reservoirs.  We developed a 3D Voronoi mesh-maker that provides the flexibility to accurately represent various complex and irregular fracture patterns. A numerical model was developed based on such fracture concepts to assess the potential performance of unconventional gas reservoirs. We conducted simulations using up to a half-million cells and considered production periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the expected life of wells and reservoirs. Our aim is to account for a wide range of flow regimes that can be observed in irregular fracture patterns, and to fully assess even slight nuances in flow behavior.  We investigated coupled primary-secondary fractures, with multiple vertical hydraulic fractures intersecting horizontal secondary \"stress-release\" fractures. We studied irregular fracture patterns to show the effect of fracture angularity and nonplanar fracture configurations on production. The results indicate that the presence of high-conductivity secondary fractures results in the highest increase in production, while, contrary to expectations, strictly planar and orthogonal fractures yield better production performance than nonplanar and nonorthogonal fractures with equivalent propped fracture lengths.  Introduction Various analytical and semi-analytical solutions have been proposed to model flow in shale-gas and tight-gas reservoirs. Gringarten (1971) and Gringarten et al., (1974) developed some of the early analytical models for flow through domains involving a single vertical fracture and a single horizontal fracture, while more accurate semi-analytical models for single vertical fractures were developed much later (Blasingame and Poe Jr., 1993). Prior to the development of models for multiply-fractured horizontal wells (Medeiros et al., 2006), it was common practice to represent these multiple fractures with an equivalent single fracture.  Several other analytical and semi-analytical models have been developed since Bello and Wattenbarger (2008); Mattar (2008); Anderson et al., (2010). Although these models are much faster than numerical simulators, they generally cannot accurately handle the very highly nonlinear aspects of shale-gas and tight-gas reservoirs because these analytical solutions address the nonlinearity in gas viscosity, compressibility and compressibility factor with the use of pseudo-pressures (an integral function of pressure, viscosity and compressibility factor) rather than solving the real-gas flow equation. Other limitations include the difficulty in accurately capturing gas desorption from the matrix, multiphase flow, multidimensional heterogeneities, unconsolidation, and several non-ideal and complex fracture networks (Houze et al., 2010).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Few attempts have been made to model shale gas reservoirs on a compositional basis. Multiple distinct micro-scale physical phenomena influence the transport and storage of reservoir fluids in shale, including differential desorption, preferential Knudsen diffusion, and capillary critical effects. Concerted, these phenomena cause a measureable compositional change in the produced gas over time.  We developed a compositional numerical model capable of describing the coupled processes of diffusion and desorption in ultra-tight rocks as a function of pore size. The model captures the various fracture configurations believed to be induced by shale gas fracture stimulations. By combining the macro-scale (reservoir-scale fractures) and micro-scale (diffusion through nanopores) physics, we show how gas composition changes spatially and temporally during production.  We compare our numerical model against measured gas composition data obtained at regular intervals from shale gas wells. We utilize the characteristic behavior illustrated in the model results to identify and to define features in the measured data. We present a workflow for the integration of measured gas composition data into production data analysis tools in order to develop a more complete well performance diagnostic process.  The onset of fracture interference in horizontal wells with multiple transverse hydraulic fractures is shown to be uniquely identified by distinct fluctuations in the flowing gas composition. Using these measured composition data, the timescale and durations of the transitional flow regimes in shales are quantified, even for high levels of noise in the rate and pressure data. Reservoir properties are inferred from the integration of the compositional shift analysis of this work with modern production analysis.  This work expands the current understanding of well performance for shale gas to include physical phenomena that lead to compositional change. This may be used to optimize fracture and completion design, improve well performance analysis and provide more accurate reserves estimation.  This work demonstrates a numerical model which captures multicomponent desorption, diffusion, and phase behavior in ultra-tight rocks. We identify and validate diagnostic trends via high-resolution composition, saturation and pressure maps. We provide a workflow for incorporating measured gas composition data into modern production analysis. "

We take the technique further and use ground-based hyperspectral imaging to identify the presence of dolomite bodies along weathered and irregular shaped cliff faces. Dolomite bodies hosted in limestone successions, common in for example Khuff and Arab Formations in the Middle East, represent a challenging feature with respect to the characterisation and exploration of hydrocarbon reservoirs. For example, dolostones interfingered with limestones are present in the Ghawar and South Pars fields (Dasgupta et al., 2002; Ehrenberg, 2006; Ehrenberg et al., 2007). Detailed descriptions of fracture related dolomite bodies in the Ghawar field have been published by Cantrell et al. (2001), whereas Jones et al. (2011) recognized dolomite bodies in the North Field in Qatar. Other studies showed lithofacies controlled dolomitization in the Arab Formation (Clark et al., 2004; Honda et al., 1989). The exceptional importance of dolomite bodies is based on a potential increase of porosity of 13% or more (Weyl, 1960) compared to the non-dolomitized host rock. However, due to their commonly sub-seismic size these potentially highly porous zones often stay undetected on seismic profiles and thus require careful investigation. In this study, the distribution and shape problem has been approached by delineating dolomite bodies hosted in Lower Khuff outcrop analogues in the Central Oman Mountains by applying hyperspectral remote sensing. We examine the degree of precision of the remote sensing detection and characterisation of dolomite bodies at varying distances to the cliff face and assess its impact on a 3D geocellular model. "

                    "abstract": "The emergence of liquid-rich and gas shale reservoirs presents major strategic opportunities and challenges for the oil and gas industry. Accurate estimation of Stock Tank Oil and Gas Initially In Place (STOIIP & GIIP) is one of the priority tasks before defining the reserves. An accurate method is proposed to calculate hydrocarbon volumes using high-resolution geological models taking advantage of huge improvements made during last decade in the field of characterization and geological modeling of unconventional reservoirs. This exact method provides fluids in place in reservoir and surface conditions with an extended black-oil formulation including condensates. The physic including the equilibrium between gravity and eventually capillary forces and adsorbed gas is fully respected using, for each lithofacies, the most accurate available geological description with 3D porosity distributions, Langmuir isotherms (Langmuir, 1918), capillary pressure curves, and thermodynamic data. Adsorbed and liquid-rich gases are considered. This method calculating hydrocarbons in place is the natural endpoint of any workflow devoted to the geological modeling of newly discovered reservoirs, particularly suited to heterogeneous reservoirs. The knowledge generated by this calculation has significant impact on fracturation programs to increase the recovery rate and field development planning. Introduction The characterization of volume of fluids in place in shale reservoir is a challenging task for many reasons, in particular because of the adsorbed gas which is a way of trapping gases in geological formations. The adsorption capacity of a gas on a rock depends on many parameters such as temperature, pressure, gas type and rock type. Shale gas is generated in source rocks, which are usually made of clay with high organic matter content. However, the organic content depends on the maturity of the organic matter from which they come from. Also, the maturity of the organic matter itself depends on the temperature history during the reservoir formation. Thus, in the same sedimentary basin, conventional reservoir can be formed from hydrocarbon expelled of unconventional reservoir. This is the case in the United States, where sedimentary basins that produce large quantities of unconventional hydrocarbons were already conventional oil and gas basins exploited for their conventional hydrocarbons. As for conventional reservoirs, there are large uncertainties on many parameters of the geological model. For shale reservoirs, another source of uncertainty is being added due to specific parameters related to them. Shale makes a wide variety of highly differing formations. All these formations differ from conventional reservoirs, and shale rock characteristics can differ from shale to shale, and even within the same shale. "

                    "abstract": "Production from shale reservoirs is receiving more attention from the petroleum industry. However, there are many complexities associated with optimal production of shale reservoirs. One complexity is the unclear fluid-phase behavior in shale nanopores. In the shale nanopores, the interaction between the pore wall and fluid molecules can significantly change the fluid-phase behavior from the bulk (unconfined) condition. Therefore, the type of pore material can influence the fluid-phase behavior. There have been several recent efforts to model the confined fluid-phase behavior in shale reservoirs. However, the effect of pore material on fluid-phase behavior in shale reservoirs has not been addressed in the previous studies. In this paper, to have a better understanding of phase diagrams in different shale environments, we perform molecular simulations with three materials (two inorganic minerals and one kerogen) and two types of nanopores (slit and cylinder) to model the confined-phase behavior of pure fluids (methane and propane) and one ternary fluid (C1/C3/nC5). From the pure-fluid simulations in the pores of three diameters (4, 7, and 10 nm), confined liquid densities are decreased, whereas vapor densities are increased in the slit and cylinder pores. When pore diameters are increased, critical points are shifted to low densities and high temperatures. Critical temperature and density under confinement can deviate as high as 15 and 60%, respectively, from the original values in bulk. Molecular simulations are conducted for the ternary fluid in the slit and cylinder pores at 160°F. Under confinement, there is a large shift in the nC5 composition of the vapor phase in the ternary diagrams, whereas only small changes have been observed in the ternary diagrams of liquid phase. The density difference between two phases is reduced. Additional tests are performed at one typical shale temperature (290°F) for this ternary fluid in both nanopore types. Phase separation is observed in the slitpore tests, although only one phase is formed in the tests of the cylinder pores. Because the cylinder pore has more adsorption surface area compared with the slit pore, a stronger adsorption effect is introduced in all tests of the cylinder pores. Based on the comparison of all results (pure fluids and ternary fluid) from the three materials, the calcite pores provide a stronger confinement effect on fluids, and the other two materials have a similar confinement effect on the phase diagrams.

                    "abstract": "The improved oil recovery of unconventional shale reservoirs has attracted much interest in recent years. Gas injection, such as CO2 and natural gas, is one of the most considered techniques for its sweep efficiency and effectiveness in low permeability reservoirs. However, the uncertainties of fluid phase behavior in shale reservoirs pose a great challenge in evaluating the performance of gas injection operation. Shale reservoirs are featured with macro-scale to nano-scale pore size distribution in the porous space. In fractures and macropores, the fluid shows bulk behavior, but in nanopores the phase behavior is significantly altered by the confinement effect. The integrated behavior of reservoir fluids in this complex environment remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate the nano-scale pore size distribution effect on the phase behavior of reservoir fluids in gas injection for shale reservoirs using a multi-scale equation of state modeling. A case of Anadarko Basin shale oil is used. The pore size distribution is discretized as a multi-scale system with pores of specific diameters. The phase equilibria of methane injection into the multi-scale system are calculated. The constant composition expansions are simulated for oil mixed with various fractions of injected gas. Bubble point, swelling factor, criticality and fluid volumetrics are studied in comparison to the behavior of the bulk fluid. It is found that fluid in nanopores becomes supercritical with injected gas, but lowering the pressure below bubble point will turn it into the subcritical state. The swelling factor is slightly higher with nanopores, and bubble point is lower than the bulk. The degree of deviation depends on the amount of injected gas. "

                    "abstract": "An understanding of the phase behavior of hydrocarbons is important in the petroleum reservoir simulation. However, fluid phase behavior in a shale reservoir is substantially different from conventional behavior. Since fluids are stored inside nanopores of shale rocks, there is a strong interaction between the pore boundary and fluid molecules. Due to this interaction, the fluid molecules are distributed heterogeneously inside the nanopores and the phase diagram is shifted under confinement. Advanced theoretical procedures such as molecular simulations are needed to properly model the heterogeneous molecular distribution inside the shale nanopores. Previous molecular simulation studies of nanoconfined hydrocarbon phase behavior have been limited to single pore size models. However, shale rocks usually have a wide pore size distribution (PSD) and single pore-size models are not accurate enough to represent a real shale system. In this work, to understand the PSD effect on the phase behavior, a recently proposed molecular simulation method, gauge-GCMC, is used to generate phase diagrams based on two types of cylindrical models (single pore and multiple pores, including one based on Eagle Ford shale rock). In single pore tests, the pore diameter is changed from 4 to 10 nm. Our results for multi-pore systems show that with an increasing pore size, the phase equilibrium properties approach the bulk values. Also, smaller pores cause a more significant shift in the phase diagram. Our results show that the small pores are filled before the large ones, which means that liquid will first be condensed in the small pores. In the Eagle Ford case, the pore model is designed by discretizing PSD data from experiments. The results show that it is possible to use a single pore model with a 10 nm diameter to represent the pore system of this shale sample. "

                    "abstract": "Compositional simulation is often required for modeling complex oil recovery processes, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (Chen and Reynolds, 2016, Dai et al., 2014). Flash calculation using Equation of State (EOS) is very CPU expensive in compositional simulation. Conventional approaches for initial guess of K-values usually have several levels of limitations. This paper reports our research motivated to provide trustworthy initial guess for flash calculation and further improve flash performance in isothermal processes. Reservoir fluid composition changes are categorized into two different scenarios: (a) slightly varying or constant composition changes in depletion process; and (b) sharp varying composition in gas injection process. Scenario (a) is reasonably parameterized as a compositional space of K-value and vapor mole fraction varied with pressure. Considering the actual simulation of gas injection process, a compositional space is defined via introducing a key pseudo composition as a controlling variable in addition to pressure. Flash calculation is formulated through direct solution of those non-linear equations in phase-split calculation, and solved by combining successive substitution iteration (SSI) and Newton-Raphson (NR) method. Using interpolation from the constructed compositional space, it is found that the initial guess of K-values for flash calculation are always obtained with safeguard. A variety of fluid samples has been applied for testing this new flash technique. The results show that initial guesses of K-values based on Wilson’s correlation results cause much more flash iterations and even failures in some gas injection examples. On the other hand, the proposed method shows significant advantages in reducing the number of flash iterations in all examples. In addition, the SSI procedure in flash can even be bypassed and only NR procedure and a simple Rachford-Rice Equation Preconditioning is sufficient. "

                    "abstract": "The phase behavior of reservoir fluids plays a fundamental role in predicting well performance and ultimate recovery. Currently, the uncertainty in phase behavior is one of the greatest challenges in developing unconventional shale resources. The complex phase behavior is attributed to the broad range of pore sizes in shale. In macro-scale geometries such as fractures and macropores, the fluid behavior is bulk-like; in nano-scale pores, the fluid behavior is significantly altered by confinement effects. The overall phase behavior of fluids in porous media of mixed pore sizes is yet to be understood. In this paper, we present a multi-scale fluid phase behavior study. A pore-size-dependent equation of state (EOS) is used to describe the fluid by the confining pore diameter. The EOS confinement parameters for fluid-pore wall surface interaction are determined by experimental results from differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal adsorption of species C1~C14. The multi-scale phase equilibria are simulated by directly minimizing the total Helmholtz free energy. A modified Eagle Ford oil is used for the case study. Constant composition expansions (CCE) of dual-scale (bulk and 15 nm) and triple-scale (bulk, 15 nm, and 5 nm) systems are simulated. The first bubble emerges from the bulk region at a lightly suppressed \"apparent\" bubble point pressure. Below the bubble point, the liquid saturation in the bulk region drops sharply, but the fluids in the nanopores are undersaturated throughout the multi-stage expansions. In the end, large amounts of intermediate to heavy hydrocarbons are retained in nanopores, implying a significant oil recovery loss in shale. The confinement effect also leads to near-critical phase behavior in small-scalenanopores (<5 nm). "

                    "abstract": "A great amount of hydrocarbon pore volume in unconventional petroleum reservoirs is distributed in pores of very small sizes, ranging from a nanometer to 100 nm pores. In such a small pore size, fluid-rock interactions play a dominant role in determining the phase behavior of hydrocarbons, which can lead to significant deviations in phase behavior, and significant errors in reserves estimation and reservoir simulations regularly performed by commercial simulators. In our research, we investigated the fluid phase behavior of hydrocarbon liquids when confined in nano-sized pores. For this end, we employed state of the art technology called lab-on-a-chip technology to mimic shale rock media in a nanofluidic chip. This novel method gives us the ability to directly visualize hydrocarbon liquid inside nano-sized pores and measure fluid properties. Using nanofluidic chips as a nano-scale PVT cell, we have been able to measure the bubble point temperature and its changes under confinement effect in pore sizes of 10 nm, 50 nm and 100 nm. We have performed experiments for binary mixtures of hydrocarbons (pentane/hexane, pentane/heptane) and a ternary hydrocarbon mixture (pentane/hexane/heptane). The results of our study shows that at 10 nm pores, the confinement has a significate effect on alteration of hydrocarbon phase behavior by increasing the bubble point temperature. On the other hand, the quantity of such effects on bubble point temperature is almost negligible at pore sizes of 50 nm and 100 nm. As a conclusion, confinement effect is significant in form of molecule-pore interactions, which leads to a significant effect on bubble point temperature. Furthermore, molecule–wall interactions that lead to alteration of phase behavior of hydrocarbons do not have a significant influence on the common molecule–molecule interactions at pore size of 50 nm and 100 nm, leading to bubble point temperatures close to those of bulk media.

                    "abstract": "Predicting asphaltene precipitation and its deposition in the porous media is key in understanding costly productivity impairment caused by formation damage. This work presents the development and application of a compositional reservoir simulator including the effects of asphaltene precipitation on production. Precipitation from the liquid mixture occurs as its solubility is reduced either by changes in pressure (natural depletion), or by composition (mixing with another fluid, such as in gas injection). Our approach represents asphaltene as the dense liquid phase computed from a three-phase flash (vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium VLLE) using the Peng Robinson equation of state. The multi-phase and multi-component reservoir simulator developed in this study uses a volume-based formulation, with pressures calculated implicitly and compositions explicitly (IMPESC approach). A cubic equation of state solves a three-phase flash to determine the number of phases co-existing in equilibrium. As asphaltene precipitates and deposits in the rock, the model dynamically calculates new porosities and permeabilities to represent the reduced pore space and effective flow path. We validated our model by matching experimental asphaltene precipitation data while predicting the expected phase behavior envelope and response to key thermodynamic variables (i.e. fluid composition, asphaltene molecular weight and its characterization in terms of pseudo critical properties). Previous modeling techniques were computationally inefficient, exhibit thermodynamic inconsistencies, and/or required special laboratory experiments to characterize the fluid. Our three-phase VLLE flash algorithm coupled with the reservoir model provides superior thermodynamic predictions compared to existing commercial techniques. This model offers the robustness and speed of a flash calculation while maintaining thermodynamic consistency, enabling efficient optimization of reservoir development strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of asphaltene precipitation on productivity.

Due to strong surface-fluid interactions and complex pore geometries in shale nanopores, PVT properties of fluids in shale are altered from those of conventional reservoirs and cannot be described by bulk-phase thermodynamics. To our best knowledge, the experimental data for hydrocarbon phase behavior in shale systems is severely absent. The experimental difficulty lies in introducing the nanoporous environment and finding an effective technique to study the fluid-nanoporous media system. In this work, we investigate the phase change of mixtures of hydrocarbons in nano-scale capillaries using a thermal laboratory technique, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which probes the thermal properties by measuring the heat exchange evolution of a sample during a temperature ramp. Porous media controlled-pore glasses (CPGs) are applied to model the nano-porous structure of shale reservoirs. CPGs (pore diameters 4.1 and 37.9 nm) infiltrated with hydrocarbons (octane and decane binary mixtures) are subjected to DSC. It is observed that at 37.9 nm the bubble point shift is negligible, but at 4.1 nm two distinct vaporization incidents occur with deviations as great as ∖xB120 K relative to the bulk. The unusual observation of bubble points for mixtures in 4.1 nm pores suggests compositional heterogeneity in the nanopore. The bubble point is modeled using Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) with the capillary pressure considered. The flash calculation is performed based on isofugacity and an interfacial tension model is accommodated. The modeling gives an exaggerated bubble point temperature shift and does not match the experimental results. This suggests the poor accuracy of the PR EOS/capillary pressure model in describing the behavior of nanoconfined fluid mixtures. "

In this paper, we apply a metaheuristics algorithm known as the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) to determine optimal well location for maximum well productivity. The ICA is an evolutionary algorithm that mimics socio-political imperialist competition. This algorithm uses an initial population that consists of colonies and imperialists that are assigned to several empires. The empires then compete with each other, which cause the weak empires to collapse and the powerful empires to dominate and overtake their colonies. We compared the ICA performance with that of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) as well as the genetic algorithm (GA) in the following four optimization scenarios: 1) a vertical well in a channeled reservoir, 2) a horizontal well in a channeled reservoir, 3) placement of multiple vertical wells, and 4) placement of multiple horizontal wells. In all four scenarios, the ICA achieved a better solution than the PSO and GA in a fixed number of simulation runs. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses for three important parameters (revolution ratio, assimilation coefficient, and assimilation angle), and the results of these analyses showed that the recommended ICA default parameters generally led to acceptable performances in our examples. However, to obtain optimum performance, we recommend tuning the three main ICA parameters for specific optimization problems. "

Molecular simulation has shown promising results in modeling phase behavior under confinement. In this study, we present a novel molecular simulation method for studying the confinement effect on the phase behavior of multicomponent systems. We validate our method by comparing the phase diagrams of pure and binary hydrocarbon systems with experimental data (where available) and the simulation results from other techniques. We also apply the proposed method in modeling the phase behavior of a ternary system (C1/C3C5) under a 4 nm slit pore confinement. Our results show that critical density increases under confinement in binary and ternary systems, and the confinement effect produces in a significant shift in the composition of the critical point. Heavier components have a higher concentration in the adsorbed layers than that of lighter components, which results in significant phase density differences under confinement. "

However, the complete understanding of the production mechanisms in shale reservoirs (micro to macro scales) and the closely interaction between natural fractures and the overall production profile at reservoir scales are in the infancy stages of their developments. In this paper we are particularly interested in extending the robustness and computational effectiveness of the Lattice Boltzman Method (LBM) applied to fractured porous media simulation. In this paper we propose a novel approach for modeling of shale reservoirs can seamless integrate rock-fluid behavior at small scales with the well-reservoir interaction at macro scales. This is done by exploring further the advantages of physical-based premises of the LBM by including the recent developed non-uniform induced permeability field concept in order to simulate fracture media, which model variation of permeabiliry around hydraulic fracrures by a function of the distance away from the fracture. In our numerical studies, based on a single well reservoir with a planar fracture, we indicate that this approach is more consistent with the physics of shale production, as it does not rely on such formulas as Langmuir isotherm and Klinkenberg's formula, which have been originally derived for low-density gases.

                    "abstract": "Fracture acidizing is a well-stimulation technique used to improve the productivity of low-permeability reservoirs and to bypass deep formation damage. The reaction of injected acid with the rock matrix forms etched channels through which oil and gas can then flow upon production. The properties of these etched channels depend on the acid-injection rate, temperature, reaction chemistry, mass-transport properties, and formation mineralogy. As the acid enters the formation, it increases in temperature by heat exchange with the formation and the heat generated by acid reaction with the rock. Thus, the reaction rate, viscosity, and mass transfer of acid inside the fracture also increase. In this study, a new thermal-fracture-acidizing model is presented that uses the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate reactive transport. This method incorporates both accurate hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics at the solid/liquid interface. The temperature update is performed by use of a finite-difference technique. Furthermore, heterogeneity in rock properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, and reaction rate) is included. The result is a model that can accurately simulate realistic fracture geometries and rock properties at the pore scale and that can predict the geometry of the fracture after acidizing. Three thermal-fracture-acidizing simulations are presented here, involving injection of 15 and 28 wt% of hydrochloric acid into a calcite fracture. The results clearly show an increase in the overall fracture dissolution because of the addition of temperature effects (increasing the acid-reaction and mass-transfer rates). It has also been found that by introducing mineral heterogeneity, preferential dissolution leads to the creation of uneven etching across the surfaces, indicating channel formation. "

The lattice Boltzmann method simulates fluid flow by defining a system with microscopic flow characteristics. In this method, the fluid consists of fictitious particles (mass fractions). These particles propagate (stream) and collide. The method assumes discretization of the physical system in both space and time. In space, the particles are allowed to move on lattice nodes. Interaction (possible collision) of particles is evaluated at these time steps. The interaction step is designed in such a way that the generalized Navier-Stokes equation is valid for the time-average motion of the particles. The focus of this work is the formulation of precise boundary conditions on the surface of fractures and the wellbore. In addition, the set of dimensionless parameters that govern the evolution of the pressure profile is redefined. Pressure profiles are presented visually throughout this paper to provide the reader insight how such a product would be utilized by the petroleum engineer. Most importantly, the methodology is tested against commercial software and results show excellent agree-ment for both homogenous and heterogenous reservoir cases.

It involves taking several factors into account, including geological uncertainty, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. Most research on well placement optimization under uncertainty has assumed static uncertainty in the reservoir parameters, until the introduction of the pseudohistory concept. The pseudohistory concept incorporates the field's probable history and results in the determination of optimal locations of future wells with greater certainty. This approach, however, requires an excessive number of simulations and may not be practical for optimization of a reservoir model having a large number of geological realizations. In this study, we use an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to perform history matching of the PUNQ-S3 reservoir model using data from six production wells over an eight-year period. This is followed by well placement optimization using a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with pseudohistory matching, carried out over two years, following the placement of the first future well. Thus, this approach not only provides increased certainty in optimal well placement but also, using EnKF as a history matching method, requires only a single “best estimate” realization for objective function evaluation during GA optimization. As a result, the total time taken to find the optimal well locations is significantly reduced. We illustrate this through comparison with the previous research. "

Emulsified acids have been used primarily in acid fracturing and matrix acidizing. The delayed nature of emulsified acids is useful in generating longer etched fractures or deeper wormholes. To predict the penetration depth of the wormholes or the length obtained from an acid-fracturing treatment, diffusion-coefficient values need to be estimated. This paper discusses the reaction kinetics of dolomite disks with emulsified acids formulated using a cationic emulsifier. The emulsified acid systems were prepared using 15 wt% HCl and 0.7 acid volume fraction. The emulsifier concentration was varied from 0.5 to 2.0 vol%. Emulsified-acid reaction rates and, hence, acid diffusivity were measured using a rotating disk apparatus at 230°F. Disk-rotational speed was varied from 100 to 1,500 rev/min. Samples of the reacted acid were collected and analyzed using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry to measure calcium and magnesium concentrations. The dolomite core samples reacted slowly with emulsified acid. Emulsions with low emulsifier concentrations (0.5 vol%) had average droplet sizes of 8.118 lm and achieved a diffusion coefficient of 1.413x10-8 m2/s. While emulsions prepared with higher emulsifier concentration (2.0 vol%) had a smaller droplet size (2.82 lm), they achieved a diffusion coefficient of 8.367x10-10 cm2/s. Reaction of dolomite with emulsified acid at 230°F was found to be mass-transfer limited. Compared with calcite, the dissolution rate of dolomite in emulsified acids was lower by one order of magnitude, and the diffusion coefficient of acid was lower by two orders of magnitude. "

Production from some reservoirs results in asphaltene precipitation in the wellbore region, leading to production loss and need for cleanup. Fluid injection can also lead to injectivity loss due to asphaltene precipitation. There are also desirable processes in which precipitation of asphaltene can lead to \"in-situ?? upgrading of heavy oil recovery. Reservoir compositional models that are currently in use rely on cubic equations of state for asphaltene precipitation. The cubic equations, despite their relative reliability in describing reservoir fluids phase behavior, become unreliable in asphaltene-rich phase description. A number of non-cubic equations of state have been introduced to overcome the shortcomings of cubic equations. The cubic-plus-association equation of state (CPA-EOS) is perhaps the method of choice in modeling asphaltene precipitation in compositional modeling. When there is no asphaltene precipitation, the CPA-EOS becomes the standard cubic equation.  In this work we implement the CPA-EOS in compositional modeling and introduce a simple technique to speed up considerably the root finding. Our efficient algorithm makes the additional cost from CPA-EOS insignificant. We also derive the basic equations for the total compressibility and total potential molar volume in our implementation of the CPA-EOS compositional modeling. Our new algorithm is introduced in a simple finite difference code. This work introduces a general framework for widespread use of the CPA-EOS in compositional modeling. "

                    "abstract": "CO2 is one of the byproducts of natural gas production in Qatar. The high rate of natural gas production from Qatar's North Field (world's largest non-associated gas field) has led to the production of significant amounts of CO2. The release of CO2 into the atmosphere may be harmful from the perspective of global warming. In this work, we study the CO2 sequestration potential in Qatar's Aruma aquifer. The Aruma aquifer is a saline aquifer in the southwest of Qatar. It occupies an area of approximately 1985 km2 on land (16% of Qatar's total area). We have developed a compositional model for CO2 sequestration in the Aruma aquifer on the basis of available log and flow test data. We suggest water production at some distance from the CO2 injection wells as a possible way to control the pore pressure. This method increases the potential for safe sequestration of CO2 in the aquifer without losing integrity of the caprock and without any CO2 leakage. The water produced from this aquifer is considerably less saline than seawater and could be a good water source for the desalination process, which is currently the main source of water in Qatar. The outcome of the desalination process is water with higher salinity than the seawater that is currently discharged into the sea. This discharge can have negative long-term environmental effects. The water produced from the Aruma aquifer is considerably less saline than seawater and can be a partial solution to this problem. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Determining optimum location of wells is a crucial step in field development. A realistic geological model is an important factor in finding an accurate optimum well location. Usually history matching is used to come up with a realistic geological model. However, there is no unique solution to the history matching problem. Often several geological models could match the history data. This introduces some risk associated with the results of well placement optimization algorithm.  In this work, we present a new modified genetic algorithm (GA) for well-placement optimization under geological uncertainty. The inputs of the algorithm are possible geological models, and the level of risk that the user can accept. In the algorithm, the classic GA is modified so that: 1) in evaluating the fitness value (cumulative production or net present value) of each individual (well location) all the possible geological models provided by users are evaluated, 2) upon convergence of the algorithm, the output is one optimum well location as the fittest individual taking into account all the provided geological models, and 3) this optimum well location is selected based on the input user-defined level of risk. Most current available algorithms in the literature do not allow the user to input the risk factor desired and individual weights for each realization. The risk-constrained algorithm will provide different optimum well locations depending on the level of risk the user wants to take. All these features make the new algorithm much more efficient and applied than current well-placement algorithms in the literature for handling geological uncertainty.  We present the application of the risk-constrained algorithm to a horizontal well-placement optimization in a gas condensate reservoir, Qatar's North Field, with multiple possible permeability fields and with different user-defined risk factors.  Introduction Well placement in reservoirs is one of the most important steps in field development. Depending on the reservoir geological and fluid properties, the production strategy could be to optimize gas production, maximize condensate production or find an economic balance between the fluids for gas condensate reservoirs. Some gas condensate reservoirs, besides heterogeneity in reservoir properties such as permeability, porosity, etc., have variation in initial fluid composition. Over the production lifetime of the reservoir, the composition, condensate and gas production will change, affecting both the near wellbore and wellbore flow conditions. The economic benefits of condensate production can be higher than crude oil production when compared on a per barrel basis, but the well planning for a horizontal gas well which encounters condensate production can lead to wellbore blockage and decreased gas production. Vertical wells are more vulnerable to the negative wellbore effects of condensate blockage than horizontal wells (Miller et al. 2010). With most of the proven natural gas reserves classified as associated or wet gas (E.I.A. 2010) it is crucial to consider condensate production and try to find the right production balance.  In well placement optimization, an efficient algorithm is essential for computational feasibility. The algorithm must also be able to find global optima or a set of optimums, while avoiding getting stuck on a set of local extrema. This requires a stochastic, as opposed to a deterministic, approach to the problem. The global optima requirement generally cancels all calculus-based, hillclimbing methods as the main solvers. Also, the algorithm must be a generalized answer to the problem to allow a wide variety of applications. The generalization characteristic of the algorithm requires the ability to handle varying types and numbers of parameters. "

                    "title": "Identifying the Optimum Wettability Conditions for the Near-Wellbore Region in Gas-Condensate Reservoirs",
                    "abstract": "Abstract The problem of condensate blocking in low permeability gas-condensate reservoirs is greatly affected by the rock-fluid interactions and capillary trapping. Many publications suggest wettability alteration to gas-wetting as a permanent solution to the problem. In this work, we present a simulation study on the optimum wettability conditions for maximum gas-condensate well productivity enhancement. Most of the work in this area focuses on reversal of wetting conditions from liquid-wetting (contact angle of 0 degree) to gas-wetting (with contact angle around 150 degrees). On the experimental side, chemicals are tested in its ability to change wettability. On the simulation side, research shows that changing the wettability to gas-wetting in the near wellbore region results in better productivity than the original liquid-wetting state. Our work investigates various states of wettability ranging from liquid-wetting to gas-wetting and its effect on gas-condensate well productivity. We also study the effect of reservoir permeability, reservoir pressure and treatment radius on the well productivity enhancement by wettability alteration.  Introduction The problem of condensate blocking in gas-condensate reservoirs has been widely discussed in the literature. Many publications present cases where the gas production rate is severely reduced due to condensate accumulation around the wellbore (Afidick et al., 1994; Barnum et al., 1995; El-Banbi et al., 2000). Other publications present methods that can be used to alleviate this problem including solvent injection (Al-Anazi et al., 2005) and hydraulic fracturing (Sognesand, S., 1991; Baig et al., 2005). These methods usually have limited success as it provides only a temporary solution to the problem.  An alternative method based on wettability alteration was suggested by researchers at the Reservoir Engineering Research Institute about 10 years ago (Li and Firoozabadi, 2000; Tang and Firoozabadi, 2002; Tang and Firoozabadi, 2003; Fahes and Firoozabadi, 2007; Wu and Firoozabadi, 2010). This method is based on reducing the liquid-wetting of the rock surface to enhance liquid mobility and reduce the accumulation of liquid condensate. A few other research groups at universities and companies have also been investigating this method (Bang et al., 2010; Ahmadi et al., 2010; Al-Anazi et al., 2007; Zheng and Rao, 2010). Pilot tests were also conducted in recent years (Butler et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2008).  In a pilot test in 2008 led by a team at Stanford University, a highly pressured tight gas-condensate reservoir was stimulated using wettability alteration (Liu et al., 2008). The permeability was 0.083 md and the reservoir pressure was 9688 psi. A temporary enhancement in the gas production rate was achieved but it was not sustained. The authors believe that the low permeability of the reservoir could be one of the main reasons for the failure. In another field application in 2009, a team from Trueblood Resources Inc., The University of Texas at Austin and 3M Company conducted a chemical treatment for a gas-condensate reservoir (Bang et al., 2010). The average permeability was 20 md and the reservoir pressure was 2971 psi. The gas production rate increased by a factor of three compared to the rate before treatment.  In this study, we show that the permeability is not the main parameter that determines the success of the treatment. The design of the treatment to optimize the gas end-point relative permeability is the main factor that controls the success of the stimulation procedure. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Well placement within a reservoir is a significant and difficult step in the reservoir development process. Determining the optimal well location is a complex problem involving many factors including geological considerations, reservoir and fluid properties, economic costs, and technical ability. The most thorough approach to this problem is that of an exhaustive search, in which a simulation is run for every conceivable well position in the reservoir. Although thorough and accurate, this approach is typically not used in real world applications due to the time constraints from the excessive number of simulations.  This paper suggests the use of a genetic algorithm applied to the horizontal well placement problem in a gas reservoir to reduce the required number of simulations. The objectives are to identify the optimized well placement and then to determine the benefit of optimization. Performance of the genetic algorithm was analyzed through different case scenarios. The genetic algorithm approach is used to evaluate the effect of well placement in heterogeneous and anisotropic reservoirs on reservoir recovery. The wells are constrained by surface gas rate and bottom-hole pressure for each case.    We apply this technique to find the optimal horizontal well location in a gas condensate reservoir in Qatar's North field.  The research provides evidence that well placement optimization is an important criterion during the reservoir development phase for horizontal wells in gas reservoirs, but it is less significant to vertical wells in a homogeneous reservoir. It is also shown that genetic algorithms are an extremely efficient and robust tool to find the optimal location.  Introduction To produce a gas condensate reservoir, well placement is a critical issue. The goal is to avoid condensate blockage, and it can be achieved by reducing the drawdown with favorite well structure and orientation (Miller, et al, 2010). In well placement optimization, an efficient algorithm is essential for computational feasibility. The algorithm must also be able to find global optima or a set of optimums, while avoiding getting stuck on a set of local extrema.

Genetic algorithms (GA) can provide robust search in complex spaces (Goldberg 1989). A reservoir is a perfect model for a \"complex space,?? providing an optimal basis for the GA to showcase its benefits over other methods. A reservoir can have thousands of local minima and maxima, making deterministic approaches extremely difficult to implement. This study uses a genetic algorithm to determine the effect on gas production of horizontal well placement in gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Natural gas is an important source for global energy. It will play a more important role in the future due to increasing energy demands, existing constraints in oil production, and environmental concerns for other fossil fuel types. Much of the current gas reserves can be found in gas-condensate reservoirs. These reservoirs, from a recovery and deliverability standpoint, can have significant differences from oil reservoirs. When the pressure, either in the wellbore or in the reservoir, drops below the dew point pressure, a liquid condensate phase appears and reduces gas production significantly. Several methods have been suggested to handle the condensate blockage problem: hydraulic fracturing, wettability alteration, Huff ‘n' Puff gas injection, and nonconventional wells. In this work, we study the application of horizontal wells in a giant gas-condensate reservoir (North Field-Qatar) to reduce the condensate blockage. We try to address a critical question of what fraction of increased gas production in a horizontal well is due to increased formation contact and what fraction results from condensate blockage reduction. Horizontal wells have smaller drawdown pressures than vertical wells, which leads to a delay in reaching the dew point pressure compared to vertical wells. Our results indicate that once the dew point pressure is reached and oil saturation is formed in the reservoir, the magnitude of oil saturation buildup in the near wellbore is lower in a horizontal well than a vertical well. The ratio of horizontal well PI to vertical well PI increases after the dew point. The fact that the PI increased after reaching the dew point indicates that this increase in productivity index is directly due to the ability of the horizontal well to reduce condensate blockage in the near wellbore. The PI in the vertical well case is decreasing significantly once the dew point pressure is reached, while the PI in the horizontal well seems to remain steady even after the dew point pressure is reached.  Introduction Much of the 6,183 trillion cubic feet of worldwide gas reserves can be found in gas-condensate reservoirs. For this reason gas condensate reservoirs are important to today's energy supply/demend problem. Some of the largest gas-condensate reservoirs in the world include the Arun Field in Indonesia, the Cupiagua Field in Colombia, the Karachaganak Field in Kazakhstan, the North Field in Qatar which borders with the South Pars Field in Iran, and the Shtokmanovskoye Field in the Russian Barents Sea. All of these large gas condensate fields have one thing in common: condensate blockage. Condensate blockage occurs due to the formation of liquid phase around the wellbore as pressure decreases below dew -point pressure. Production performance can decrease dramatically if these condensate banking effects are not understood at the start of field development.  The initial producing gas-oil ratio, the gravity of the stock-tank liquid, and the color of the stock-tank liquid are three fluid properties that can be used in the field to determine what type of fluid is in a reservoir. Retrograde gases exhibit a lower GOR limit of 3,300 scf/stb and an upper GOR limit of 150,000 scf/stb. Retrograde gases have stock-tank liquid gravities between 40° and 60° API, and can be lightly colored, orange, brown, greenish, or water-white in color. Retrograde gases are referred to as retrograde gas-condensates, retrograde condensate gases, gas condensates, and condensates (McCain 1990). "

Often, broad possibilities and constrains on computational resources limit the scenarios that can be considered. When dealing with heterogeneities, the intuitive engineering judgment may not be sufficient, and use of optimization algorithms becomes necessary in finding a favorable production plan.  Although there have been extensive publications on optimization algorithms for oil reservoirs, there is little research aimed at gas or gas condensate reservoirs. In this work, we studied optimization of horizontal well placement in gas condensate reservoirs. One of the current challenges in development of gas condensate fields is condensate blockage. As pressure decreases condensate accumulates around the wellbore, leading to significant reduction in gas production. Horizontal wells can effectively solve this problem. However, due to their high cost, and complex phase behavior determining optimum locations cannot be based only on intuitive judgments.  Here we present a horizontal well-placement optimization method for gas condensate reservoirs based on a modified genetic algorithm. Unlike oil reservoirs, the cumulative production in gas reservoirs does not vary significantly (although the variation is not economically negligible) and there are possibly more local optimums. Therefore the possibility of finding better production scenarios in subsequent optimization steps is not much higher than the worse case scenarios, which delays finding the best production plan. In this work, we use a cumulative distribution function to magnify the difference between production scenarios. As a result of this change we were able to find the best scenario with considerably fewer simulations. We apply the modified algorithm to a section of Qatar's North Field, a gas condensate field with the world's largest gas reserves. Our results show that this method can efficiently find the optimum horizontal well locations and can lead to valuable increase in gas and condensate production.

                    "abstract": "CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) was started in 1950. Low sweep efficiency and early breakthrough issues were associated with the CO2-EOR system. Foam-EOR was introduced to improve the sweep efficiency instead of polymers to avoid formation damage caused by polymers. Foam stability reduces in high-salinity environments, high-temperature formations (>212°F), and in contact with crude oil. The present study the using of nanoparticles and viscoelastic surfactants (VES) to improve foam mobility control for EOR application. This paper study the CO2-foam stability with using alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) as a foaming agent and the change on the mobility-reduction factor (MRF) for different foam solutions by adding nanoparticles and VES. To achieve this objective, foam-stability for different solutions was measured at 77 and 150°F using high-pressure view chamber (HPVC). Interfacial tension measurements were conducted to investigate the destabilizing effect of crude oil on the different foam systems. Coreflood experiments were conducted using Buff Berea sandstone cores at 150°F, saturated initially with a dead-crude oil. The CO2 foam was injected with 80% quality as tertiary recovery mode. The oil recovery and the pressure drop across the core were measured for the different foam solutions. Adding silica nanoparticles (0.1 wt%) of size 140 nm and viscoelastic cocamidopropyl betaine surfactant (cocobetaine VES) (0.4 wt%) to the AOS (0.5 wt%) solution improves both foam stability and MRF. In contact with crude oil, unstable oil-in-water emulsion formed inside the foam lamella that decreased foam stability. A weak foam was formed for AOS solution, but the foam stability increased by adding nanoparticles and VES. The interfacial tension measurements revealed positive values for the spreading and the bridging coefficients. Hence, the crude oil spread over the gas-water interface, and lamella films were unstable due to the bridging of oil droplets. The oil recovery from the conventional waterflooding (as a secondary recovery before foam injection) was 48% of the original oil-in-place. From the series coreflood experiments, AOS was not able to enhance the oil recovery. However, more oil was recovered in the presence of nanoparticles (12 %) and VES (18%). Nanoparticles and VES were able to improve the foam stability for AOS solution. Adding nanoparticles is highly recommended for EOR applications, particularly at high temperatures. "

                    "abstract": "Invasion of mud filtrate while drilling is considered as one of the most common sources of formation damage. Minimizing formation damage, using appropriate drilling fluid additives that can generate good-quality filter cake, provides one of the key elements for the success of the drilling operation. This study focuses on assessing the effect of using different types of nanoparticles (NPs) with Ca-bentonite on the formation damage and filter cake properties under downhole conditions. Four types of oxide NPs were added to a suspension of 7 wt% of Ca-bentonite with deionized water: ferric oxide (Fe2O3), magnetic iron oxide (Fe3O4), zinc oxide (ZnO), and silica (SiO2) NPs. The NPs/Ca-bentonite suspensions were then used to conduct the filtration process at a differential pressure of 300 psi and 250°F, using a standard filter press. Indiana limestone disks of 1 in. thickness were examined, as the filter medium, to simulate the formation in the filtration experiments. Computed-tomography (CT) scan technique was used to characterize the deposited filter cake and evaluate the formation damage that was caused by using different fluid samples. The results of this study showed that the filtrate invasion is affected by the type of NPs, which is also affecting the disk-porosity. Using 0.5 wt% of Fe2O3 NPs with the 7 wt% Ca-bentonite fluid showed a higher potential to minimize the amount of damage. The average porosity of the disk was reduced by 1.0%. However, adding 0.5 wt% of Fe3O4, SiO2, and ZnO NPs yielded a disk-porosity decrease by 4.7, 13.7, and 30%, respectively. The decrease in the disk-porosity after the filtration is directly proportional to the volume of invaded filtrate. Compared to that of the base fluid, the best reduction in the filtrate invasion was achieved when adding 0.5 wt% of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs by 42.5 and 23%, respectively. The results revealed that Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 NPs can build better Ca-bentonite-platelet structure and thus, a good-quality filter cake. This is due to their positive surface charge and stability in suspensions, as demonstrated by zeta potential (ζ-potential) measurements, which can minimize formation damage. Increasing the concentration of Fe3O4 NPs from 0.5 to 1.5 wt% showed an insignificant variation in the filtrate invasion, spurt loss, and filter cake permeability; however, an increase in the filter cake thickness as well as the amount of damage created was observed. The 1.5 wt% of ZnO NPs showed a better performance compared to the case having 0.5 wt% of ZnO NPs, but in the meanwhile it showed the lowest efficiency when compared to the other types of NPs. This could be due to their surface charge and suspensions’ instability. Results of this work are useful in evaluating the drilling applications using Ca-bentonite based fluids modified with NPs as an alternative to the commonly used Na-bentonite. Additionally, it might help in understanding the NPs/Ca-bentonite interaction for providing more efficient drilling operations and less formation damage. "

                    "abstract": "Proppant diagenesis has been introduced recently as a damaging mechanism to the fracture conductivity in shale formations. The mechanism was used to explain the low values of the field-measured fracture conductivity as well as the long-term decline of the lab-measured API conductivity data. Previous studies revealed the presence of a diagenetic overgrowth on the proppant surface and around the embedment crater after being exposed to high-temperature and/or high-stress conditions. The objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate the diagenesis of bauxite proppant in calcite rich Eagle Ford shale fractures. The interaction between the proppant and the formation was studied by aging its mixture in a deionized water for prolonged period of time at elevated temperature of 325°F to accelerate the involved reactions. Aluminum-based bauxite proppant of 20/40 mesh-size was mixed with a crushed Eagle Ford shale sample of 50/100 mesh-size. The mixture was aged at 325°F and 300 psia for three weeks. The surfaces of the proppant and the formation were examined for mineral overgrowth and dissolution using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The supernatant fluid was analyzed for cations’ concentrations using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and the sulfate ion concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer. The proppant and Eagle Ford formation were then aged separately at the same conditions to explain the sources of the leached ions and the observed overgrowth materials. The results show the diagenetic activity that could result from the use of bauxite proppant in Eagle Ford shale fracturing. The ICP results indicated the potential dissolution of the proppant at high temperature. The observed overgrowth materials were identified as calcium sulfate, calcium zeolite, and iron-calcium zeolite. The calcium sulfate was found to be explicitly sourced from the Eagle Ford dissolution-precipitation mechanism. The SEM/EDS results indicated the presence of calcium zeolite after aging both cells: the proppant/formation mixture and the formation alone. The iron-calcium zeolite was found on the proppant surface as a result of the fluid/proppant/shale interactions. The study contributes to the understanding of the damaging mechanisms to the fracture conductivity in the Eagle Ford shale formation. Results impact the choice of proppant and fluid for fracturing optimization and long-term production sustainability in the Eagle Ford shale reservoirs. "

                    "title": "Bio-Oil Dispersants Effectiveness on AsphalteneSludge During Carbonate Acidizing Treatment",
                    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing is a remedial well stimulation that done to overcome formation damage near wellbore or improve the permeability. Although acidizing treatments are proven and abundant there is still inherit from formation damage when pumped. Acid-induced asphaltene sludging is becoming an increasing cause of oil well stimulation Failure. The objective of the paper is to evaluate the performance of coconut oil as a bio-oil dispersant against commercial dispersants in preventing asphaltene sludge while acidizing carbonate cores with 15 wt.% HCl and a chelating agent. A Kuwaiti crude oil was used in this study has an API of 38° and 2% asphaltene content. The crude oil was characterized by a variety of analytical techniques including total acid and base numbers (TAN, TBN), saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltene analysis (SARA), density, viscosity and elemental analysis. Indiana limestone cores were used with average porosity of 16% and permeability ranges (9-13) md. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the mineral and clay content in the cores. Sludge tests were used to examine the acid and oil compatibility using anaging cell under 500 psi and 160°F with oil to an acid ratio of 1:1. Coreflooding experiments under reservoir condition were done with the selected two acid systems, 15 wt. % HCl and achelating agent. Indiana limestone cores with a permeability of 7-12 md were initially saturated with the crude oil then acid was injected until breakthrough. The injected acid volume was recorded and CT-scan imaging of the cores after the acid treatment was used to evaluate the structure and the propagation of the wormhole. The effluent fluids were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and pH measurements. The results for a Kuwaiti crude oil showed the formation of 13 wt% sludge with 15 wt% HCl and it increased to 19 and 30 wt% with increasing acid concentrations to 20 and 28 wt%, respectively. The presence of iron(III) in the system increased the sludge precipitation to 17.8 wt% at 15 wt% HCl and 3,000 ppm iron concentration. The sludging decreased to 7.5 wt% by adding 300 ppm coconut oil to the system. The formation of asphaltene sludge in the carbonate acidizing retards the wormhole propagation. Hence, the injected acid volume to the breakthrough decreased from 1 to 0.4 by adding 300 ppm coconut oil to the acid system. A conical wormhole was formed with the injection of 15 wt% HCl, comparing to a uniform wormhole in the presence of coconut on the acid system. In the case of stimulating the cores with achelating agent (20 wt% GLDA), the coconut oil exceeds the expectations with the minimum pore volume needed to breakthrough compared to the GLDA alone or with the chemical dispersant B. This study concluded that the use of dispersant can help reduce the asphaltene sludge and create better acid propagation through the core. The results can be employed to design the optimum acid formulation and create the desired wormhole in carbonate formations. "

                    "title": "Experimental Evaluation of Sand Porosity in Eagle Ford Shale Fractures",
                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is the main stimulation method used to economically produce from shale formations. The method requires the injection of a fracturing fluid at a pressure which is high enough to fracture the formation, and as a result, improves the well productivity. A proppant is pumped with the fracturing fluid to prevent the closure of the induced fractures after the treatment. The proppant inside the fracture is subjected to a high earth closure stress, which causes proppant crushing, embedment, and compaction mechanisms. The subsequent reduction of the fracture width and proppant porosity reduces the fracture conductivity and could be crucial to the success of the fracturing treatments. The objective of this study is to experimentally evaluate the reduction of the propped fracture width and proppant porosity between two Eagle Ford shale samples under stress conditions. An experimental model of propped fracture in Eagle Ford shale was prepared using outcrop samples. Sand proppant of the size 20/40, 40/70, and 100-mesh were tested at the concentrations of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 lb/ft2. A high-pressure core holder with modified fittings was used to subject the fracture model to different closure stress values up to 8,000 psia. A new method was used to evaluate the change in the propped fracture width and proppant porosity as a function of closure stress. The fracture width was measured by the consecutive imaging of the fracture under stress using a digital borescope and an image analysis software. The change in the proppant porosity was calculated at each stress and post-experiment sieve analysis was done to quantify the crushed proppant due to the applied stress. The fracture width and the equivalent proppant porosity under stress were found to be a function of the proppant size and concentration. The proppant porosity under stress was found to be directly proportional to the proppant concentration and inversely proportional to the proppant size. The reduction in fracture width and proppant porosity due to stress ranged from 3.66 to 22.03% and from 5.29 to 39.85% respectively. The crushing of sand proppant was found to be as high as 28.03% at 8,000 psia and 0.2 lb/ft2 proppant concentration, and reduced by increasing its concentration or decreasing its size. The propped fracture width and proppant porosity under stress can be used as inputs to well production models, reservoir simulation models, and fracture design calculations. The results can also be used in the proppant selection process to improve the fracture conductivity and maximize the well productivity of Eagle Ford shale formations. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic Fracturing has been used successfully in the oil and gas industry to enhance oil and gas production. Recent years have seen the great development of tight gas, coalbed methane, and shale gas. Different fluids were used as fracturing fluids in shale and sandstone formations, including the use of CO2, N2 and CO2 foam, slick water, crosslinked solutions, and oil-based fracturing fluids. The objective of this study is to develop an experimental setup to measure the breakdown pressure to initiate the fractures in shale and tight sandstone cores. This study investigated the effect of injection flow rate, temperature, fluid viscosity, and fluid type on the breakdown pressure of different rock cores. 5 wt% KCl brine, slick water with a friction reducer, linear gel systems were used as a fracturing fluid. Kentucky, Scioto, Bandera, and Berea sandstone cores were used. Also, Mancos, Marcellus, and Barnett shale cores were used in this study. Finally, the behavior of the breakdown pressure was examined as a function of the back pressure (0, 100, 300 psi). The preliminary results show that the breakdown pressure increased as the injection flow rate increased. Where the breakdown pressure increased from 438 to 1,000 psi as the flow rate increased from 5 to 10 cm3/min in case of 5 wt% KCl with Kentucky sandstone cores. The breakdown pressure increased in Marcellus shale to 1,800 psi in case of 5 wt% KCl at 5 cm3/min. As the fluid viscosity increased the breakdown pressure increased, it increased to 1,115 psi in case of 2 gptg friction reducer (5 cp) comparing to 5 wt% KCl (1.1 cp) case at 5 cm3/min. A straight line relationship was found between the breakdown pressure and the logarithmic scale of the fluid viscosity. This study will give recommendations for the fluid viscosity, type, and the injection flow rate that will improve the efficiency of the hydraulic fracturing operation. "

                    "abstract": "The two-scale model for simulating carbonate acidizing has gained substantial attention recently. Five studies dealt with matching experimental data studying regular acid. Four studies considered limestone samples, while the fifth examined one dolomite core with face dissolution. The previous work only considered the pore volume (PV) to breakthrough (PVBT) to match experimental results. Researchers assumed linear kinetics for hydrochloric acid (HCl) carbonate reaction and relied on changing Carman-Kozeny exponents to match experimental data. Unlike previous studies, experiments were performed on 6-in.-long and 1.5-in.-diameter vuggy-dolomite cores at two sets of temperatures (150 and 200°F) and acid concentrations (15 and 20 wt% HCl). Computed tomography (CT) was used to scan the cores when dry, wet, and after acidizing. Porosity distribution calculated from the dry and wet scans was used to build a rectangular model with the cylindrical core inscribed inside. Nonlinear reaction kinetics were applied. The acid-reaction rate and diffusion coefficient were modified on the basis of X-ray-fluorescence (XRF) results and effluent chemical analysis. Wormhole 3D shape and experimental PVBT were used to assess the quality of model results. The tuned model was used to simulate a hypothetical 18-in. core as well as large-scale radial experiments to assess its prediction capabilities, and finally the model was used to predict the dolomite-acidizing performance under field conditions. The simulation runs emphasize that the exclusion of the wormhole shape and branching from the matching process results in an unrealistic match. It is important to simulate the cylindrical shape of the core using the actual porosity distribution to capture the wormhole growth, which is increasingly important when the wormhole propagates near the core perimeter. The present study highlights that matching parameters using experimental data yields a trustworthy model that matches both PVBT and wormhole spatial propagation. Accordingly, there is no need for excessively changing the Carman-Kozeny correlation exponents to match the dolomite-acidizing experiments. The current model accurately matches the wormhole propagation inside the core along with the PVBT. This model can be tuned using a few acidizing experiments and then can be used to generate an acid-efficiency curve with a high degree of confidence, thus avoiding the extra experimental cost. The current model was able to match two sets of experiments and follow the experimental trend of longer cores and large-scale radial experiments. It was used to predict acid performance under field conditions. The results show that the optimal PVBT under field conditions is always lower than the one predicted under laboratory conditions; the acid depth of penetration has a significant effect on the acid-efficiency curves; and the vertical flow of acid should be considered in acid-job design.

                    "abstract": "The production and transportation of highly viscous heavy and extra-heavy crude oils are two of the paramount concerns in the oil and gas industry due to logistical difficulties and costs. Viscosity is highly sensitive to asphaltenes content of heavy oils and bitumen. Asphaltenes, which are the most polar and aromatic components of heavy oil, have high propensity toward self-association, thus increasing viscosity significantly. The present work proposes a new type of plant-based solvent that contains functionalized molecules that can interact with asphaltenes at the molecular level and modify viscosity. Effects of solvent on the viscosity of tested crude oil and functional groups of asphaltenes were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively by viscosity measurements and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. Sensitivity of asphaltenes aromaticity and stacking to solvent were evaluated by curve deconvolution and fitting routines of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of solid asphaltenes. The proposed solvent is a plant-based, non-hazardous substitute to the conventional hazardous solvents, e.g., toluene, that provides efficient viscosity reduction. Asphaltenes critical concentration in the heavy oil was delayed by adding the solvent, requiring more precipitating agent to separate asphaltenes from oil. Furthermore, asphaltenes aromaticity decreased by the addition of solvent. Its application also increases asphaltenes solubility in the oil and decreases asphaltenes precipitation and deposition. "

                    "abstract": "Sandstone stimulation faces multiple challenges due to the heterogeneity of the formation and the sensitivity of its clay minerals. Fines migration results in lowering the formation productivity and complicates the stimulation process. Multiple field studies showed that treatment of fines migration is critical and can result in permanent damage of the wellbore. This study aims to locate, quantify, and describe the damage resulting of fines migration damage and its stimulation in sandstone formations and examine the impact of the clay content and its nature on the stimulation process. This work is structured to evaluate the stimulation of fines migration damage in Bandera, Berea, and Kentucky sandstones. Fines migration was induced by injecting deionized water to trigger the mobilization of the clay minerals in the core. Both HCl or formic acid, and mud acid stages were injected following the fines migration induction. The new formation damage evaluation methodology utilizes computed tomography (CT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) scanning before and after the fines migration induction and its stimulation. The data from CT and NMR were combined and processed to generate a 3D representation of the cores pore structure, which gives an insight on how the clay nature impacts the stimulation process and the pore system. The developed technique exhibited an excellent ability to visualize the core porosity distribution and the changes in the pore structure following the fines migration damage and the acid treatment. The 3D representation succeeded to assess the magnitude and the location of the formation damage due to fines migration and its stimulation. The injection of deionized water in the studied formations resulted in a different petrophysical responses, which came matching the prediction built on the mineralogy and porosity mapping using computed tomography data. These changes in pore structure prevailed as a controlling variable of the acidizing process. The stimulation of the damaged cores at 150 and 250°F resulted in the deposition of the alumino silicates toward the core outlet. These deposits are attributed to the acid leaching of the aluminum and iron ions from the alumino silicate structures. The high temperatures resulted in the deposition of alumino silicates closer to the injection point. The enhancement in permeability noticed in all of the studied formations showed to be due to the induction of narrow channels in between heavily deformed pore structures. This work added to the sandstone stimulation technology a new tool to assess the true impact of acid stimulation on fines migration damage. The high level of resolution of tracking the changes in the pore structure lay the road to optimize the treatments to enhance the productivity and lower the cost. This technique has a potential as a formation evaluation technique to evaluate other types of formation damage, such as fracturing fluids and water blockage. "

                    "abstract": "Removing oil-based mud (OBM) filter cake is a difficult task. Low removal efficiency of filter cake may result in pay zone damage, including drilling fluid filtrate incompatibilities with reservoir fluids, fines migration, and undesirable change of permeability. This paper proposes a cost-effective and single-stage application of a new surfactant/oxidant system to enhance the removal efficiency of OBM filter cake. A qualitative wettability experiment was performed to test wetting property of OBM emulsion before and after being cleaned by non-ionic surfactants. Phase behavior of the new surfactant/oxidant system was also shown when the variables were the concentration and type of coated persulfates. Filter press simulated various high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) well conditions in laboratory to form and remove the OBM filter cakes. Average permeability ratio (Kfinal / Kinitial) of Berea sandstone disks was calculated by static filtration test to show the degree of formation damage. Surfactant used in the new removal system ensures OBM emulsion to be water-wet and promotes it to flow more easily in contact with the rock surface. Coated persulfate can be circulated out of wellbore after the removal work, based on its low density and tightly coated property. HP/HT filter cake removal tests indicate the optimized new system can disperse and remove the filter cake by up to 98 wt% removal efficiency. The optimized surfactant/oxidant system affects the formation permeability slightly because Kfinal / Kinitial ratio is consistent in the 0.99~1.09 range. With optimized formulation and soaking time, the cleaning solutions will benefit the oilfield industry significantly by removing OBM filter cake under challenging well conditions. Cost-Effective and single-stage application of the new removal system makes the oilfield industry more efficient and economical to remove OBM filter cake. The new surfactant/oxidant system minimizes the effects of drilling fluid on formation properties, based on its compatibility with OBM emulsions, quick removal steps, high removal efficiency, and acceptable Kfinal / Kinitial results.

                    "abstract": "In recent years, viscoelastic surfactants (VES) seemed like an optimum solution for fracturing fluids. The technology was introduced to replace heavily damaging polymers. VES low thermal stability, high cost, and incompatibility with acid additives limited its application in the field. This work aims to investigate the crosslinking of the VES micelles using different shapes of silica and iron oxide nanoparticles to reduce the VES loading and extend its thermal stability. This work utilized surfactant templating and ultrasonicated co-precipitation methods to produce a specifically tailored mesoporous silica and magnetite nanorods respectively, which were mixed with an anionic VES using ultrasonic bathing. Both spherical and rod-shaped particles of silica and iron oxides were examined to investigate the particle size, shape, and surface charge impact on the degree and the strength of the VES micellization. The studied particles physical properties were assessed using zeta potential, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The rheological performance of the VES mixtures were evaluated at 280 and 350°F through various shearing and heating ramps. The mixture microstructure was investigated using a polarizing microscope before and after the heating process. The produced network between the VES micelles and the nanoparticles were examined using TEM to describe its nature. The interaction between the nanoparticles and the anionic VES is controlled by the VES concentration, the particle shape, and the temperature range. Although the spherical particles failed to cross link the VES at a concentration of 2 wt%, it succeeded to extend the thermal stability of the VES at a concentration of 4 wt% up to 350°F. The nanorods succeeded to enhance and extend the thermal range of the VES system at only 2 wt% VES. Both shapes of particles performed similarly at 4 wt% VES and up to 280°F. The addition of 7 pptg of silica nanorods extended the thermal stability of the 4 wt% VES, which exhibited and held an apparent viscosity of 200 cp for 2 hours. The addition of rod-shaped particles contributed to stronger micelle to micelle entanglement, especially at VES concentration of 2 wt%. The nanoparticles resulted in secondary networking that contributed positively to the viscosity of the mixture. The rod-shaped particles showed lower thermal stability at 350°F. They maintained 50 cp compared to the total failure of the VES by itself with 10 cp at 350°F. The polarizing microscopy, the TEM, and the DLS analysis showed that the enhancement in the apparent viscosity comes from closely packed structures of nanoparticles in surfactant strings. This research shows the importance of the selected nanoparticle size, shape, and surface charge on the rheological performance of VES. It lays out a route to synthesize custom built nanoparticles to accommodate the chemistry of surfactants for higher performance and lower cost. This work has implementations in both self-diverting acid systems and fracturing fluids. "

                    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, low salinity waterflooding has emerged as a successful tertiary recovery method. Several mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the effect of the low salinity waterflooding. Fines migration in clay containing sandstones is amongst the main reasons attributed to the success of this technique. The effect resulting from the migration of fines helps homogenize the flow pattern of the waterfront, thus achieving better displacement efficiency. Little or no attention has been given to the effect of water blockage on multilayered reservoirs. The present work aims to study the effect of low salinity waterflooding on multilayered clay-rich sandstone reservoirs. Parallel coreflood experiments were used to investigate the effect of low salinity waterflooding on multilayered reservoirs. Clay-rich Bandera sandstone cores were used for the experiment. Cores from two different blocks were used to obtain a contrast in the absolute permeability. All cores were saturated with the same high salinity formation water and then displaced with oil to reach initial water saturation. The cores were then aged at the reservoir temperature for 21 days. Three parallel coreflood experiments were used to compare the high salinity waterflooding to the low salinity waterflooding in both secondary and tertiary modes. Core effluent and CT scan were used to evaluate the recovery from all experiments. The high salinity waterflooding shows heterogeneous water invasion, and more oil was recovered from the higher permeability core. Alternatively, the low salinity waterflooding in secondary mode showed a more homogeneous recovery regime, as the water blockage kept the waterfront advancement even between cores. Finally, the application of low salinity waterflooding in tertiary mode slightly improved the recovery from both cores equally. This work is the first to emphasize the benefits of low salinity waterflooding in multilayered clay-rich sandstones. The conclusions from this work suggest a diversion effect to occur allowing for higher displacement efficiencies in multilayered clay-rich reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Friction reducers (FRs) represent an essential component in any slickwater-fracturing fluid. Although the majority of previous research on these fluids has focused on evaluating the friction-reduction performance of chemical components, only a few studies have addressed the potential damage these chemicals can cause to the formation. Because of the polymeric nature of these chemicals—typically polyacrylamide (PAM)—an FR can either filter out onto the surface of the formation or penetrate deeply to plug the pores. In addition, breaking these polymers at temperatures lower than 200°F remains a problem. The present study introduces a new FR that replaces the linear gel with an enhanced proppant-carrying capacity and reduced potential for formation damage. Friction-reduction performance, proppant settling, breakability, and coreflood experiments using tight sandstone cores at 150°F were conducted to investigate a new FR (FR1). The performance of the new FR was compared with two different FRs: a salt-tolerant polymer that is a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylamido-methylpropane sulfonate (FR2), and a guar-based polymer (FR3). Different breakers were used to examine the breakability of the three FRs, including ammonium persulfate (APS), sodium persulfate (SPS), hydrogen peroxide (HP), and sodium bromate (SB). The friction reduction of the new chemical was higher than 70% in fresh water or 2 wt% potassium chloride (KCl) in the presence of calcium chloride (CaCl2) or choline chloride. The presence of 1 lbm/1,000 gal of different types of breakers did not affect the frictionreduction performance. The friction reduction of 1 gal/1,000 gal of the new FR1 was also higher than that of the guar-based FR3 at a load of 4 gal/1,000 gal at the same conditions. The results show that the new FR is breakable with any of the tested breakers. Among the four tested breakers, APS is the most-efficient breaker. Static and dynamic proppant-settling tests further indicated a superior performance of FR1 for proppant suspension compared with a PAM FR (FR2). Coreflood experiments showed that FR1 did not cause any residual damage to the core permeability when APS was used as a breaker, compared with 10% and 9% damage when FR2 and FR3 were tested, respectively. Coreflood tests also showed that FR1 is breakable using SB with only 2.5% damage, whereas FR2 and FR3 resulted in 47% and 41% damage, respectively. The results also show that higher salinity does not affect the breakability of the new FR. The proposed FR shows higher friction-reduction performance and better proppant-carrying capacity with no formation damage, compared with the conventional counterparts. Hence, FR1 is a viable choice for application in fracturing formations with proppants. "

                    "abstract": "The possibility of improving wellbore stability of shale by adjusting its wettability was investigated. First, an optimized surfactants combination (0.2 wt% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) plus 0.1 wt% sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)) was screened out that could effectively reduce the surface tension of the water-based mud (WBM) or fresh water, and increase the contact angle with shale. Then, regular tests on viscosity, filtration, lubrication, water activity, and special tests on linear swelling, rolling recovery rate, temperature tolerance, salts, and active cuttings tolerance, along with pressure transmission test (PTT) of shale were conducted to evaluate the performance of the optimized surfactants combination. Results show that the WBM's surface tension could be decreased from 45.1 to 20.0 mN/m and the contact angle on the shale could be increased from 34.5 to 63.5°. The optimized surfactants combination could also improve the WBM's performance to inhibit shale hydration. The WBM in the presence of the optimized surfactants combination had good tolerance to a pollutants complex (0.8 wt% CaCl2, 0.8 wt% MgCl2, 5 wt% sodium bentonite, and 10 wt% NaCl) and could withstand a high temperature of 130 °C. Foaming phenomenon could be avoided by adding surfactants in the last step. PTT results show that compared with 4 wt% NaCl, the optimized surfactants combination could effectively retard the pore pressure transmission in shale and reduce its permeability by 98.6%. The addition of CTAB to the WBM or fresh water, hydrolyzed CTA+ cation adsorbs on the surface of shale via an ionic bond, forming a hydrophilic base toward shale and a lipophilic base toward the WBM or water, thus, increasing the contact angle with shale and improve wellbore stability in shale.

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is a key treatment for economical production from shale formations. High surface pressure is used to fracture the formation, and proppant is pumped to prevent fracture closure after the pressure is removed. The ability of proppant to maintain high fracture width and permeability controls the flow of the hydrocarbon fluids towards the wellbore, and, hence, the behavior of different proppants at in-situ conditions is critical to the success of fracturing operations in shale formations. The objective of this paper is to experimentally evaluate the performance of two widely used proppants in Marcellus shale at elevated stress conditions. A proppant-crushing test between two samples of Marcellus shale was performed to evaluate the proppant performance at different closure stress values up to 10,000 psia. Two types of proppants were tested: sand and sintered bauxite at different concentrations. This work used a digital microscope to measure the width of the fracture at each closure stress; a series of photographs of the propped fracture were taken, and an image analysis software was used for fracture width measurements. The amount of crushed proppant and induced formation fines due to embedment were also quantified after each test. The results indicate that with partial monolayer proppant, both proppants experience a significant reduction in the fracture width at elevated closure stresses, reaching as high as 48% at 10,000 psia. Proppant physical properties were found to affect the initial fracture width even though the proppant concentration was the same. The use of multiple layers of bauxite proppant reduced the loss of fracture width to 14% at 10,000 psia closure stress. Results reveal that sand proppant shows a high degree of crushing at 0.05 and 0.25 lb/ft2 proppant concentrations. On the other hand, the use of bauxite results in a higher amount of formation fines due to proppant embedment, which could cause severe damage to the fracture conductivity. The paper contributes to the understanding of how proppants behave at in-situ conditions of shale hydraulic fractures. Results can be used to optimize proppant and fluid selection, and reduce the sources of damage to fracture conductivity to maximize well productivity. "

                    "abstract": "One of the important functions of drilling fluids is to form a filter cake, which minimizes leakoff of drilling fluids into the formation. Drilling-fluid invasion can cause formation damage, but good-quality filter cake can reduce such damage. This research focuses on the laboratory techniques and performance results of testing innovative calcium-bentonite-based drilling fluids containing nanoparticles (NPs) for minimizing formation damage during drilling in harsh environments. A rotational viscometer was used to measure the rheological properties of the tested fluids. Zeta-potential measurements were conducted at different NP concentrations to assess their stability and to investigate the role of charge potential. Indiana limestone outcrop disks were examined as the filter media for both static and dynamic filtration (up to 350°F and 500 psi) using a filter press. The filter cakes were examined using a computed-tomography (CT) scan and scanning-electron-microscopy energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to measure the concentrations of key ions in the filtrate fluids. A reduction of 43% in the filtrate-fluid volume was achieved when adding 0.5 wt% of ferric oxide NPs compared with that of the base fluid. However, using silica NPs led to an increase in the filtrate volume and filter-cake thickness. Using 0.5 wt% of ferric oxide NPs provided less agglomeration and reduced the filter-cake permeability. In addition, the SEM-EDS and ICP-OES analysis showed a replacement of the cations dissociated from the bentonite by NPs, which promoted the formation of a rigid clay-platelet structure. The produced filter cakes consisted of two layers, as indicated by the CT-scan analysis. Increasing the concentration of NPs resulted in an increase in the fluid loss and filter-cake thickness. At a higher NP concentration (2.5 wt%), a third layer of NPs was observed, which adversely affected the filter-cake characteristics, as demonstrated by CT-scan analysis and SEM-EDS elemental mapping. Furthermore, the NP-bentonite fluids had stable rheological properties at different temperatures (up to 200°F) and NP concentrations. In addition, aging these fluids at 350°F for 16 hours showed minor changes in the rheological properties. This research work provides an experimental evaluation of improved calcium-bentonite-based fluids using NPs under downhole conditions. The ferric oxide NPs have the potential to enhance the properties of calcium bentonite, as a low-cost alternative, to perform well in an application where the higher-value sodium bentonite is commonly used, which could provide more-efficient drilling operations and less formation damage.

                    "title": "Evaluation of Eco Friendly Bio-Oil Dispersants on the Inhibition of Asphaltene Precipitation in a Kuwaiti Crude Oil",
                    "abstract": "Asphaltene precipitation, flocculation and deposition are vital problems that may cause serious damage to reservoirs, wells, and production facilities. Asphaltene precipitation may occur during primary depletion or acidizing jobs as well as after the injection of rich gas or carbon dioxide. The Organic deposition removal is considered a costly workover job with the current oil prices. The solvents that are usually used are toluene and xylene, which are considered carcinogenic and toxic chemicals. The use of dispersion to inhibit the organic deposition is essential and can be expensive, as it is required for the life of the well. The objective of this paper is to compare the effectiveness of two chemical dispersants and deasphalted oil against vegetable oils (coconut oil and andiroba oil) on the inhibition of asphaltene precipitation. A Kuwaiti crude oil sample was used in this study with an API of approximately 38° and asphaltene content of 2 wt%. The crude oil was characterized by a variety of analytical techniques including: Total acid number (TAN), Total base number (TBN), water content, Saturates, Aromatic, Resins, and Asphaltene analysis (SARA), density, viscosity and elemental analysis. Dispersants and vegetable oils were analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the functional groups. An Asphaltene dispersants test was carried out at different concentrations of 150, 300 and 500 ppm and temperatures of 25 and 70°C to evaluate the dispersant efficiency and limitations. The results of this study showed that the dispersant should be designed based on understanding the asphaltene structure and interaction mechanism. Temperature greatly affects the blended dispersant performance due to the relation of asphaltene solubility and temperature; therefore designing optimum concentration must be taking into account. Employing the deasphalted oil as solvent to mitigate asphaltene precipitation can be desirable from economical perspective. Coconut oil performs very well as an asphaltene dispersant when paired with DAO at a concentration of 500 ppm or solely at 25°C. The results can be employed in designing and optimizing dispersants that are environmental friendly and cost effective. "

                    "title": "Low-Carbon-Steel Corrosion at High Temperatures by Aminopolycarboxylic Acids",
                    "abstract": "Aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCAs) have been used in a variety of applications ranging from textiles to pharmaceuticals. They are also commonly used in the oil-and-gas industry for scale removal, standalone stimulation, and iron control. Because of the common-place usage of APCAs, it is important to understand the corrosion that can result from the use of APCAs and the methods that can be applied to reduce corrosion damage resulting from their use. The objective of this work is to evaluate the corrosion rate of APCAs on low-carbon steel at high temperatures and to determine the mechanism of corrosion. At high temperatures, conventional acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) are extremely corrosive, lack penetration, and have sludging tendencies. Several organic acids such as formic acid and citric acid were proposed to overcome these shortcomings. However, these organic acids have displayed problems with solubility and compatibility. Chelating agents show good dissolving power, low corrosion, low sludging tendencies, and excellent iron control, and have been successfully used to replace HCl in certain applications. Furthermore, some of them are easily biodegradable and environmentally friendly. To study the mechanism of corrosion at high temperature, N-80 coupons were exposed to APCA solutions for 12 hours in the absence of corrosion inhibitors (CIs). At 350°F, the corrosion rate of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), L-glutamic diacetic acid (GLDA), hydroxyethyl ethylene triacetic acid (HEDTA), and methylglycine diacetic acid (MGDA) had corrosion rates of 1.07, 0.754, 0.974, and 0.76 lbm/ft2, respectively. When the temperature was lowered to 300°F, the corrosion rates of each chelating agent decreased to 0.858, 0.724, 0.803, and 0.642 lbm/ft2 for EDTA, GLDA, HEDTA, and MGDA, respectively. The addition of a 1-vol% sulfur-containing CI to HEDTA and MGDA tests at 350°F caused a significant decrease in corrosion rates to 0.0102 and 0.00561 lbm/ft2, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanism of the APCA corrosion of low-carbon steel was found to be a combination of chelant-enhanced dissolution and cathodic reduction of the APCA. Chelant-enhanced dissolution involves the dissolution of the oxide layer on the surface of the metal, and is accelerated at high temperatures by reductive dissolution. Cathodic reduction of carboxylic-acid groups of APCAs was determined to be responsible for the corrosion of the bare metal layer. "

                    "abstract": "This study demonstrates the application of an alternative numerical-simulation approach to effectively describe the flow field in a two-scale carbonate-matrix-acidizing model. The modified model accurately captures the dissolution regimes that occur during carbonate-matrix acidizing. Sensitivity tests were performed on the model to compare the output with experimental observations and previous two-scale models in the literature. A nonlinear reaction-kinetics model for alternative acidizing fluids is also introduced. In this work, the fluid-field flow is described by the Navier-Stokes momentum approach instead of Darcy’s law or the Darcy-Brinkman approach used in previous two-scale models. The present model is implemented by means of a commercial computational-fluid- dynamics (CFD) package to solve the momentum, mass-conservation, and species-transport equations in Darcy scale. The software is combined with functions and routines written in the C programming language to solve the porosity-evolution equation, update the pore-scale parameters at every timestep in the simulation, and couple the Darcy and pore scales. The output from the model simulations is consistent with experimental observations, and the results from the sensitivity tests performed are in agreement with previously developed two-scale models with the Darcy approach. The simulations at very-high injection rates with this model require less computational time than models developed with the Darcy approach. The results from this model show that the optimal injection rate obtained in laboratory coreflood experiments cannot be directly translated for field applications because of the effect of flow geometry and medium dimensions on the wormholing process. The influence of the reaction order on the optimal injection rate and pore volumes (PVs) of acid required to reach breakthrough is also demonstrated by simulations run to test the applicability of the model for acids with nonlinear kinetics in reaction with calcite. The new model is computationally less expensive than previous models with the Darcy-Brinkman approach, and simulations at very-high injection rates with this model require less computational time than Darcy-based models. Furthermore, the possibility of extending the two-scale model for acid/calcite reactions with more-complex chemistry is shown by means of the introduction of nonlinear kinetics in the reaction equation.

                    "abstract": "A new in-situ generated HCl acid was developed to overcome the fast reaction rate and high corrosion rates of 15 wt% regular HCl acidizing system. The objectives of this work are to: (1) examine the reaction rate of the new in-situ generated HCl with calcite at 100, 150, and 200℉, and (2) compare the reaction rate of 15 wt% regular HCl with the new in-situ generated HCl. The rate of the reaction of 15 wt% HCl and the new in-situ generated HCl was measured using the rotating disk apparatus (RDA). Calcite disks were used with the specifications of 1.5 in. the diameter and 0.65 in. thickness. The effects of disk-rotational speed (200-1,200 rpm) and temperature (100-200℉) were investigated. Calcium concentrations were measured in the samples collected from the RDA, which were used to calculate the rate of dissolution. The disk surface after the tests was analyzed using Scanning-Electron-Microscope–Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Experimental results showed that the rate of dissolution at 100 and 150°F was controlled mainly by the rate of mass transfer of the acid to the surface. By increasing the temperature to 200℉, the overall rate of reaction for the in-situ generated HCl was mass transfer limited up to 800 rpm and surface limited above 800 rpm. Based on the dissolution rate results, the diffusion coefficient, the activation energy, and the reaction rate constant at 100, 150, and 200°F were determined for the new developed in-situ generated HCl and were compared to 15 wt% regular HCl. This study will assist in developing a more cost-effective and efficient design of acid treatments through a slower reaction rate of the in-situ generated HCl. This new in-situ generated acid system reacts slower and more efficient compared to regular HCl in carbonate and sandstone reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in coal seams combines CO2 storage with enhancing methane (CH4) recovery. The efficiency of CO2 sequestration depends on the coal-formation properties and the operating conditions. This study investigated the effects of the sodium chloride (NaCl) salinity of coal-seam water, injection flow rate, injected-gas composition, and CO2 state (formation pressure) on CO2 sequestration in coal formations. Coreflood tests were conducted on nine coal cores to simulate the injection of CO2 into coal formations. The change in the effective water/coal permeability after CO2 injection was measured. A commercial simulator was used to match the pressure drop across the core from the experimental study by adjusting the relative permeability curves. Moreover, permeability dynamic measurements were conducted to estimate the absolute permeability reduction caused by coal swelling. The effective water permeability in the tested coal decreased during CO2 injection because of its adsorption onto the coal surface, coupled with a reduction in the relative water permeability. As salt concentration increased, the change in the pressure drop across the core increased, but this effect decreased as the formation pressure increased. Higher formation pressure and lower nitrogen (N2) concentrations led to further permeability reduction as a result of the higher CO2 adsorption onto the coal surface. Furthermore, as the injection flow rate increased, the contact time of CO2 at the coal surface decreased. Hence, the CO2 adsorption to the coal matrix decreased, and thus the difference in the effective water permeability slightly decreased. CO2 injectivity in fully water-saturated formations increased initially as the gas relative permeability increased, then the injectivity decreased as a result of matrix swelling and absolute permeability reduction. Moreover, the water salinity in coal formations decreased the overall gas relative permeability and increased the water relative permeability. Similar behavior occurred in the presence of N2. It is derived from these observations that the injection of CO2 into highly volatile bituminous coal seams for CO2 sequestration purpose is more efficient as the salt concentration increases, especially at high injection pressures.

                    "abstract": "The optimal injection rate for wormhole propagation and face dissolution at low injection rates during carbonate matrix acidizing is well-established. However, little research is documented on the subject of how the presence of oil affects this process. This study demonstrates the impact of oil saturation on wormhole characteristics while acidizing reservoir and outcrop cores under reservoir conditions (200°F). Coreflood experiments at flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 20 cm3/min were performed to determine the optimal acid-injection rate for wormhole propagation when acidizing homogeneous limestone reservoir cores, low-permeability Indiana limestone cores, and homogeneous dolomite cores with dimensions of a 3- and 6-in. length and a 1.5-in. diameter. The experimental work involved acidizing cores saturated with water, oil, and waterflood residual oil by use of 15-wt% regular hydrochloric acid (HCl). The viscosity of the crude oil used was 3.8 cp at 200°F. Computed-chromatography (CT) scans enabled the characterization of wormholes through the cores. The concentrations of the calcium and magnesium ions in core effluent samples were measured with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and the effluent samples were titrated to determine the concentration of the acid. At injection rates of 0.5 to 20 cm3/min, 15-wt% HCl was effective in creating wormholes with minimal branches for cores with residual oil saturation (ROS). Compared with brine- and oil-saturated cores, those at ROS took less acid volume to breakthrough. In addition, the efficiency of regular acid improved with increased acid-injection rates in the presence of residual oil. A decrease in the acid pore volume (PV) to breakthrough for oil-saturated cores was observed at high acid-injection rates, which could be attributed to viscous fingering of acid through oil. Unlike brine-saturated and oil-saturated cores, cores at ROS showed no face dissolution at low acid-injection rates. The conclusions of this work highlight the impact of oil saturation on matrix characteristics while acidizing carbonate rocks. "

                    "abstract": "Because any increase in hydrocarbon recovery helps the petroleum industry respond to the ever-increasing demand for energy, increasing recovery from both conventional and unconventional reservoirs is the primary goal of developing new completion strategies. This paper introduces a new completion strategy, called Complex Toe-to- Heel Flooding (CTTHF), that increases oil recovery from sandstone formations. It then confirms the viability of CTTHF by using a commercial reservoir simulator to compare CTTHF to conventional waterflooding and Toe-to- Heel waterflooding. Finally, it presents several different methodologies for implementing CTTHF successfully, efficiently, and cheaply. CTTHF improves reservoir management and enables better oil recovery than do other methods. It begins with the injection of a highly viscous slug near the toe of a horizontal well to form an impermeable barrier. An appropriate plug is then set to separate the perforations used to inject the barrier from the rest of the well. Then, the entire horizontal section of the well is perforated and a suitable packer is set to separate the horizontal section into a flooding zone (the perforations immediately heel-side from the plug) and production zone. The flooding zone is then used to create an injector hydraulic fracture into which water is injected to flood oil towards the production zone. As the flood material to oil ratio increases, the packer can be moved heel-ward. The oil is produced from the annulus through dual tubing completion or by any other convenient method, and the flood material can be either liquid or gas, depending on the application. Though CTTHF is more complex than conventional strategies, it enables better recovery and can be implemented using a variety of completion techniques and technologies. Because the location of the packer can be changed, moreover, CTTHF minimizes the production of flood material. It is also compatible with dual tubing, coil tubing, and annulus production, and its design can be optimized using a variety of tubes, plugs, and packers. "

They consist of solid particles with specific strengths and are used to keep the fractures open to enhance well production. They can be natural sand or artificial ceramic materials. Most ceramic proppants are alumina-based, using kaolin and bauxitic clays as the raw materials. The acid resistance of the fracturing proppant is an essential property. Acids are sometimes needed to clean the fracture by removing scale and clays that reduce the fracture conductivity. In this study, several experiments were conducted using a see-through cell, and an aging cell with 10 wt% HCl, mud acids (6.0 wt% HCl, 1.0 wt% HF and 12.0 wt% HCl, 3.0 wt% HF), i.e., (6:1 and 12:3), and formic (HCOOH), trisodium salt of N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (Na3-HEDTA) and HF mixtures up to 350 °F. The effects of varying acid system, temperature, soaking time, static and dynamic conditions were examined. The supernatant of solubility tests was analyzed with Fluorine Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (19F NMR) to identify the reaction products. Key elements concentrations were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). A Zeiss Axiophot microscope was used to acquire images for the proppant particles to study particle shape and effect of acid solubility. Proppants were then analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The proppant was sieved before and after the experiments. The residual solids were dried and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. Effects of acid dissolution on mechanical performance of the proppants were also tested using an automated load frame. The results show that bauxite has a minimal solubility of 0.5 wt% in 10.0 wt% HCl. The proppant is readily soluble in different mud acids, 56.0 wt% dissolved in some cases. The amount dissolved increases with temperature, soaking time, acid concentration, and dynamic conditions. The fines generated and the changes in grain size distribution are detrimental to the proppant conductivity. 19F NMR showed aluminum fluoride complexes with different mud acids due to the high Al/F affinity. XRF showed that the solubility of the proppant occurs mainly in mullite and maghemite due to their high reactivity. Crush resistance test shows a direct relationship between solubility and mechanical strength of bauxite. Assessing solubility effects will help to better design acid treatments without jeopardizing the integrity of the proppant. "

Thus, new foaming agents are required to stabilize foam without causing formation damage. Nanoparticle-stabilized foams offer promise as suitable substitutes for polymers as they do not damage the formation.

Experimental outcomes of this work show that the addition of nanoparticles to alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) and guar-gum solutions can considerably enhance CO2 foam stability. Polymer/surfactant solutions such as guar-gum/AOS generate foams with half-life time significantly shorter than that of the surfactant-nanoparticle dispersion like AOS-SiO2. That is, under same conditions, polymer-surfactant based foams are less stable compared to surfactant-nanoparticle based foams. "

                    "abstract": "CO2-foam has been used as a fracturing fluid to develop unconventional resources and specifically for water-sensitive reservoirs. CO2-foam not only reduces formation damage by minimizing the quantity of aqueous fluid which enters the formation, but also reduces the water consumption for environmental conservation purposes. CO2-foam as a hydraulic fracturing fluid provides for rapid cleanup during flowback. Although it is common to use surfactants to generate and stabilize foams, they tend to degrade at high temperatures (>212°F) and in high-salinity environments. The present work evaluates new foaming solutions that incorporate nanoparticles to investigate the mobility-control performance when such foams are used as hydraulic fracturing fluids. Of special interest in this work is the study of mobility reduction factor (MRF) of CO2 foam, generated with polymer-based solution, e.g., guar gum, in the presence and absence of nanoparticles, to assess the apparent fluid viscosity at high temperature and high salinity. To achieve this objective, coreflood tests were conducted on different Buff Berea sandstone cores at both 77 and 250°F. CO2 gas was injected with the different solutions simultaneously to generate foam with 80% quality. The pressure drop across the core was then measured to estimate the MRF. Results show that alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) improves the MRF by 300% compared to NaCl solution. Adding silica nanoparticles and guar-gum to the AOS solution improves both foam stability and MRF. At 250°F, the AOS solution retained foam stability, while the MRF increased to 28 compared to that of at 77°F. Choice of surfactant concentration is a critical parameter in generating stable foam. However, the economical use of surfactants is limited by various factors such as surface adsorption, process cost, surfactant loss, and surfactant degradation at high-temperature reservoirs. Nanoparticle solutions can be employed to improve CO2 foam stability as well as MRF factor. Adding nanoparticles is highly recommended for hydraulic fracturing applications, particularly in fracturing stimulation at high-temperatures. "

Further augmentation of asphaltene dosage leads to formation of asphaltene micro-aggregates that are detrimental to oil rheological behavior. However, a more detailed and comprehensive interpretation is required to determine the contribution of each mechanism in aforementioned steps. In the present work, asphaltene samples from a light crude oil have been accordingly fractionated by various precipitants and analyzes chemically in various solvents by none-fragmenting techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Influences of heteroatoms on asphaltene precipitation mechanisms and molecular weight were assessed by conducting elemental analysis. Sensitivity of asphaltene constituents stacking to extraction methods were evaluated by curve deconvolution and fitting routines of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of solid asphaltenes. Finally, asphaltene precipitation onsets were determined for various asphaltene samples and conditions by using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technique. Results of the current study reveal the substantial impacts of various precipitants and solvents on asphaltene aromaticity and its propensity toward self-association. Also, the results indicate that alteration of the extraction methods is conducive to variation in asphaltene molecular weights as well as precipitation onset points. Alteration of critical aggregate concentration (CAC) and critical micelle concentration (CMC) were observed from NIR results and were used to determine asphaltene stability. Current study proposes further understanding of asphaltene self-association and aggregation mechanisms. Concrete understanding of these mechanisms leads to designing more efficient asphaltene dispersants and heavy oil viscosity modifiers to prompt higher oil recovery and facilitate transportation processes.

                    "abstract": "CO2 foam has been used for different oil and gas applications such as hydraulic fracturing and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Foam is used as a fracturing fluid to develop unconventional reservoirs and specifically water-sensitive reservoirs. It is also employed as an EOR fluid to control fluids mobility and improve sweep efficiency. Moreover, using foam as a hydraulic fracturing fluid provides rapid cleanup during flowback. Although it is common to use surfactants to generate and stabilize foams, they tend to degrade at high-temperatures (>212°F) and in high-salinity environments. Adding nanoparticles is a new technique to stabilize CO2 foams that supports the proppant-carrying requirements for fracturing fluids. The present work evaluates new foaming solutions that incorporate nanoparticles to investigate the mobility-control performance when these foams are used as hydraulic fracturing fluid. This study specifically investigates the effect of nanoparticles on the stability of alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) foam and the corresponding mobility-reduction factor (MRF), which indicates the apparent fluid viscosity at high-temperature and high salinity. To achieve this objective, foamability and foam stability tests were conducted at 77 and 150°F. Foam stability was studied for various solutions using a high-pressure view chamber (HPVC) setup to find the optimal solution, at which higher foam stability in the CO2 foam system can be reached. Coreflood tests were also conducted on different Buff Berea sandstone cores at both 77 and 250°F. CO2 gas was injected with the different solutions simultaneously to generate foam with 80% quality. The pressure drop across the core was then measured to estimate the MRF. The results of this work show that foam half-life decreases as the temperature increases from 77 to 180°F. Nanoparticle-based foams are more stable over time compared to those stabilized by surfactant. AOS, as an anionic surfactant, improves the MRF by 300% compared to brine alone. Adding silica nanoparticles to the AOS solution improves the foam stability and increases the MRF eight-fold. At 250°F, the AOS solution retained foam stability, while the MRF increases to 28 compared to foam at room temperature. Surfactants may degrade at high temperatures, and hence, cannot be used to stabilize foam. Protecting surfactants from being degraded and improving the foam stability is of great importance and can be achieved by adding nanoparticles to the solution. Nanoparticle solutions can be used to improve CO2 foam stability. Adding nanoparticles is highly recommended for hydraulic fracturing applications, particularly in fracturing stimulation at high-temperatures. "

                    "abstract": "Proppants are solid particles with specific mechanical strength that are widely used in hydraulic-fracturing operations. Their main purpose is to keep fractures open and increase well production. They can be naturally occurring sand grains or synthetic ceramic proppants. The acid resistance of fracturing proppants is an important property because acids are used during the hydraulic-fracturing process to remove the scale and clays that affect fracture conductivity. These acids affect proppants that are already present in the fracture, as well. Industry measures acid solubility of proppants according to the API RP 19C (2008)/ISO 13503-2 (2006) standard. This measurement produces a solubility number, but gives no guidance on the expected final effect of acid dissolution on the mechanical performance of tested proppants or on how acid-solubility values vary as a function of time, temperature, and dynamic conditions. This study investigates factors affecting the interactions of regular mud acid [hydrofluoric acid (HF)/hydrochloric acid (HCl) = 3:12] with sand and clay-based proppants under downhole conditions. Experiments were conducted by use of an aging cell at temperatures up to 300°F. The effects of varying temperatures, soaking times, and static and dynamic conditions were examined. The supernatant of solubility tests was analyzed with fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (19F-NMR) to identify the reaction products. Total aluminum, iron, silicon, titanium, and calcium concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical-emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). A Zeiss Axiophot microscope was used to acquire images for the proppant particles to study particle shape and effect of acid solubility. Proppants were then analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). After the solubility tests, the proppants and the residual solids were dried and analyzed by use of scanning-electron microscopes (SEMs) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) capabilities. Effects of acid dissolution on mechanical performance of the proppants were also tested through use of an automated load frame. The results show that sand proppants are readily soluble in regular mud acid, with a maximum recorded solubility of 10 wt%. The amount dissolved increases with temperature, soaking time, and dynamic conditions. Clay-based proppants are also soluble in mud acid, with much higher acid solubility than that seen in sand proppants. The proppant packs show more compaction for clay-based proppants than for sand proppants before and after acid exposure. Understanding the effects of acid on natural and synthetic proppants will improve production by promoting the design of acidizing regimens used during hydraulic-fracturing operations. "

                    "title": "Corrosion Rates of Cr- and Ni-Based Alloys With Organic Acids and Chelating Agents Used in Stimulation of Deep Wells",
                    "abstract": "Acid treatments of deep wells completed by use of chromium (Cr) -based tubulars represent a real challenge to the oil industry. On one hand, Cr-based tubulars are used to protect against carbon dioxide (CO2) corrosion, but on the other hand, the protective layer [chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3)] dissolves in hydrochloric acid (HCl). This makes protection of Cr tubulars during acidizing very challenging, especially at high temperatures. At temperatures greater than 200°F, there is a need to add corrosion-inhibitor intensifiers, most of which depend on heavy metals [copper (Cu) or antimony (Sb)] or are not effective at temperatures greater than 300°F [e.g., potassium iodide (KI)]. Over the last decade, a new chelant was developed, glutamic acid N, N-diacetic acid (GLDA), which can dissolve carbonate minerals from both carbonate and sandstone formations. This chelant can form wormholes in carbonates (both calcite and dolomite) and does not destabilize clay particles present in sandstone formations. In the present paper, the corrosion rate of GLDA solutions is compared with that of other chelants and simple organic acids that are used for carbonate dissolution, such as hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), acetic acid, and formic acid. All corrosion tests were conducted at high temperatures and pressures and extended for up to 6 hours at temperature and pressure. The Cr and nickel (Ni) -based coupons representing tubular metallurgy were examined thoroughly after the tests, and the spent fluids were analyzed for key cations [Cr, Ni, molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn)]. Compared with formic acid, acetic acid, and even HEDTA, GLDA is much less corrosive to Cr-13 alloys. The results of this work show that GLDA at 20 wt% causes almost no corrosion with Cr-13 up to 300°F. Unlike GLDA, HEDTA was found to be corrosive at a pH = 3.8, and requires attention when used in wells completed with CR-13-based tubulars. On more-corrosion-resistant Cr- or Cr-Ni-based alloys, such as super CR-13, Duplex-2205, Inconel-625, and Incoloy-925, the corrosion rate of GLDA is still far below the acceptable limit of 0.02 to 0.05 lbm/ft2 up to 350°F. In wells with corrosive sweet and sour gases, tubulars consisting of low-carbon steel, Cr-based steel, or corrosion-resistant Cr-Ni alloys can be effectively protected by a combination of GLDA with a minimal amount of a suitable corrosion inhibitor. Because of its favorable environmental profile, this mixture meets all the Oslo-Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Northeast Atlantic (OSPAR) requirements for use in the North Sea. On the basis of these results, GLDA solutions can be used to stimulate carbonate and sandstone wells completed with Cr- and Ni-based tubulars, while maintaining the integrity of the tubulars. "

The objective of this work is to give the reader a better understanding of scale removal methods by chelating agents in oil field applications.

Results were obtained through a variety of tests including compatibility, dissolution, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP), Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). At high temperatures, conventional acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) show severe corrosion, lack of penetration and sludging characteristics.

Based on these shortcomings, chelating agents are often used and show good dissolving power, low corrosion, low sludging tendencies, excellent iron control, and some are highly degradable and environmentally friendly. In addition, chelating agents are commonly used to dissolve most oil field scales that are both insoluble in HCl and detrimental to production.

                    "abstract": "Viscoelastic surfactant (VES)-based acid systems are used in acid-diversion applications. However, high- temperature, interaction of the VES and Fe(III) (as a contaminant), addition of alcohol-based additives, and chelating agents all interfere with the apparent viscosity of the VES-based acid and reduce its effectiveness. This paper introduces a new VES-based acid system that can be used for diversion in high-temperature formation matrix acidizing. This VES-based acid system exhibites high thermal stability in the presence of Fe(III) contamination and chelating agents. Also, this work elucidates the reaction mechanisms between VES, Fe(III), and two chelating agents (hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), and Glutamic acid diacetic acid (GLDA)) in spent acids. To study the rheological properties of the VES-based acid, three different formulations of spent acid (20 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl), 5 vol% VES) were examined. By comparing the apparent viscosity of the three samples as a function of temperature, the same trend (similar viscosity at same temperatures) was illustrated. Moreover, the effect of chelating agents and Fe(III) on VES viscosity in spent acids was investigated. To understand the VES interaction with Fe(III) in spent conditions, a compatibility test was conducted on the live VES-acid and Fe(III) system. The results showed that the maximum concentration of the Fe(III), which is compatible with live VES-based acid, is 5,000 ppm; however, at higher Fe(III) concentrations, the VES interacted with the Fe (III) and precipitated. Rheological measurements were conducted on the spent VES based system with different Fe(III) concentrations as a function of temperature (80-400°F) at pH in the range of 4-5. At Fe(III) concentrations lower than 6,000 ppm, the apparent viscosity of the VES-based solutions increased in temperatures below 150°F as the Fe(III) concentration was increased. At higher temperatures (150-400°F), the maximum viscosities reduced with iron concentration, but generally they exhibited excellent thermal stability (150 cp at 400°F). The spent VES-based solution, when combined with 6,000 ppm Fe(III), entirely loses its viscosity. Experimental results indicated that the first peak of apparent viscosity of the VES-based solution increases at low concentrations (0.010 mol/L) of the chelating agents, HEDTA and GLDA, but for both chelating agents at higher concentrations (0.053 and 0.107 mol/L), the apparent viscosity reduces. Inclusively, the apparent viscosity remained above 140 cp with the highest concentration of chelating agents in the temperature range of 80-400°F. Furthermore, both chelating agents were added (1:1 molar to Fe(III)) to VES-based acid solutions with Fe(III) concentrations of 5,000 and 6,000 ppm. The results demonstrated that the negative impact of the chelating agents on the apparent viscosity does not superimpose on the negative effect of Fe(III). Chelating agents rebuilt the viscosity of the VES-based solution with 6,000 ppm Fe(III). For the 5,000 ppm Fe(III) solution, they reduced the apparent viscosity at lower temperatures (150°F) and increased the maximum apparent viscosity over a temperature range of 150-250°F. "

                    "abstract": "Successful matrix acidizing of carbonate reservoirs depends on the selection of optimal stimulation fluids. Because of the rapid reaction rate and corrosive nature of HCl in downhole conditions, other alternatives are much in demand. Organic acids, particularly methanesulfonic acid (MSA), offer a viable alternative to HCl in terms of being less reactive as well as less corrosive and environmentally benign. However, MSA is expensive. To reduce the cost, this study proposes to use blend of HCl and MSA for carbonate stimulation, while enhancing the properties of HCl. Coreflood studies were performed and the results were compared to those obtained by equivalent concentrations of the individual acids. Three different ratios of HCl and MSA were used to conduct coreflood experiments on 6-in. long Indiana Limestone cores at 250°F. The volume of acid required to reach breakthrough was recorded, and the cores were analyzed using CT scans. Wormhole structures were identified, and their tortuousities were determined. The effluent samples were analyzed for pH, calcium concentration, and unconsumed acid concentration. Coreflood studies indicated that 5:5 wt% HCl:MSA blend was the most suitable candidate for matrix acidizing among the three blends tested (2.5:7.5 and 7.5:2.5 wt% HCl:MSA being the other two blends investigated). At the optimum injection rate of 7.5 cm3/min, both 2.5:7.5 and 5:5 wt% HCl:MSA mixture required lesser pore volumes (PVs) of acid to reach breakthrough, compared to their individual acid controls. A single, straight, and dominant wormhole was observed with no branching and less tortuousity in both the cases. The control experiments with equivalent concentrations of HCl and MSA required higher PVs of acid to reach breakthrough with branching during wormhole propagation. Calcium ion dissolution was least for the 5:5 wt% mixture among the three blends tested. Higher unconsumed acid concentration was noted in case of 5:5 wt% compared to 2.5:7.5 wt% blend, thus promising greater penetration depth with the same PV of acid. On the other hand, the wormhole formed by the acid blend of 7.5:2.5 wt% HCl:MSA required almost the same PV of acid to reach breakthrough as its corresponding HCl control, and it was more enlarged and tortuous than its corresponding MSA control. 5:5 wt% HCl:MSA blend creates deeper wormholes and retards the HCl reaction with the rock matrix. Major advantages rendered by the new acid mixture include: (1) deeper wormholes that will ultimately result in enhanced well productivity, and (2) cost effectiveness in carbonate stimulation compared to standard systems currently used in the market.

Over the past few years, nanoparticles (NPs), among other additives, have been investigated to address these challenges. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of using ferric oxide NPs on the filter cake properties in downhle drilling environments. Having an efficient filter cake is an important property of the drilling fluid and can affect the success of drilling operations. This research focuses oncharacterizatingthe filter cakes produced by Ca-bentonite-based drilling fluid contains ferric oxide NPs at downhle conditions. A combination of computed-tomography (CT) scan and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was used in filter cake characterization. The effect of NP concentration, fluid preparation method, and filtration condition were studied. A HP/HT filter press was used to perform the filtration process at conditions up to 350°F and 500 psi. Indiana limestone core disks were used to simulate the filter media. The experimental results showed that the ferric oxide NPs improve the filter cake and filtration properties of Ca-bentonite-based drilling fluid in the presence of polymer and other additives. Low NP concentration is preferred for obtaining a good cake quality with the best characteristics obtained at 0.3–0.5 wt% NPs. Furthermore, this drilling fluid can withstand conditions up to 500 psi and 350°F. Cake properties of 0.151 in. thickness, 6.9 ml filtrate volume, and 0.428 µd permeability was obtained at such conditions. The addition of NPs to the drilling fluid improved the filter cake properties under both static and dynamic filtration. SEM-EDS analysis confirmed the efficiency of using NPs to form a smoother/less porous filter cake morphology. Moreover, sonication for one hour and hydration for 16 hours are recommendedfor better preparation of these fluids. This research provides an experimental evaluation of using ferric oxide NPs with Ca-bentonite-based drilling fluid to produce high-quality filter cake at downhole conditions. The characteristics of the filter cake gererated confirmed the efficiency of such fluids. "

                    "abstract": "Matrix acidizing has long been used for permeability and productivity enhancement purposes in oil and gas wells. In sandstone reservoirs, a preflush is needed to dissolve carbonate minerals so that HF is not consumed in the main step on carbonate minerals. The preflush step also prevents the potential precipitation of the reaction products of HF. HCl has been an important component in preflush; however, it has high corrosion and reaction rates, especially in high pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) wells. An acidizing system that is comparable to HCl in terms of availability and price is needed; however, the shortcomings associated with HCl, such as its fast reaction rate and high corrosion rate, must be addressed in the development of similar systems. Therefore, this study investigates the effectiveness of a new in-situ generated HCl acid that offers a slower reaction and corrosion rate in high-temperature reservoirs. The new in-situ generated HCl acid treatment was used to acidize two types of sandstone cores (Grey Berea and Bandera) and two type of carbonate cores (limestone and dolomite). X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on the sandstone cores to determine the mineralogy to design a better treatment. Coreflood experiments were conducted at 250 and 300°F to study the impact of the treatment on the permeability of sandstone cores. Acid injection rates were set at 1 and 5 cm3/min in the case of the sandstone treatments and 1 and 2 cm3/min for the carbonate stimulation. The effluent samples were collected every quarter pore volume to further analyze the ability of acid to dissolve carbonate and oxide minerals. Porosity profiles and wormhole propagation were determined before and after acid treatment using Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Superior stimulation results were achieved at 250 and 300°F with the in-situ generated acid system. However, 15 wt% regular HCl caused 79% damage to the Berea core at 300. The new acid system resulted in positive stimulation results (kf/ki ranging from 1.7 to 2.7) in both Grey Berea and Bandera sandstone cores without any sign of fines migration or sand deconsolidation. In the case of carbonate stimulation, more PV of acid was needed to reach breakthrough if 15 wt% regular HCl was used as a treatment fluid. The wormhole propagation was more efficient in the case of the new acid system. Face dissolution was observed when using 15 wt% regular HCl in carbonate acidizing. The corrosion rate of low-carbon steel (L-80 and C-95) and chrome-based tubular (Cr-13) was significantly less than that noted with 15 wt% regular HCl at 300. This study will assist in developing a more cost-effective and efficient design of acid treatments with minimal impact to the formation's integrity. This new in-situ generated acid system efficiently removes carbonate and oxide minerals in HP/HT sandstone reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Fracturing fluids are commonly formulated with pond water to ensure reliable rheology. However, pond water is becoming more costly, and in some areas, it is difficult to obtain. The use of produced water in hydraulic fracturing has gained increased attention in the last few years, because it could solve freshwater-acquisition difficulties and reduce disposal costs. A major challenge, however, is its high content of total dissolved solids (TDSs), which could cause formation damage and negatively affect fracturing-fluid rheology. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using produced water to formulate crosslinked-gel-based fracturing fluid. This paper focuses on the compatibility of produced water with the fracturing-fluid system and the effect of salts on the fluid rheology. Produced-water samples were analyzed to determine concentrations of key ions. The fracturing-fluid system consisted of natural guar polymer, borate-based crosslinker, biocide, surfactant, clay stabilizer, scale inhibitor, and pH buffer. Compatibility tests of the fluid system and its components were conducted at different ion concentrations. Apparent viscosity of the fracturing fluid was measured with a high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) rotational rheometer. All rheology tests were conducted at 300 psia and 180°F with a 3-hour test duration. Further investigations to study the effect of adding chelating agents to the fluid system were also carried out. Results indicate the potential of untreated produced water to cause precipitates and, hence, formation damage. Precipitates were successfully prevented by diluting the produced water with fresh water. Divalent cations were found to be the main source of precipitation, and reduced amounts of each ion were determined to prevent precipitations. The separate and combined effects of Na, K, Ca, and Mg ions on the viscosity of the fracturing fluid were also studied. Regardless of the concentration of monovalent cations, divalent cations reduced fluid viscosity by up to 100 cp. Monovalent cations reduced the viscosity of fracturing fluid only in the absence of divalent cations, and showed no effect in the presence of Ca and Mg ions. The use of chelating agents has reduced the precipitation of divalent cations and enabled the formulation of fracturing fluid at higher Ca and Mg concentrations. Some chelating agents showed the ability to complex with the boron ion and/or reduce the system’s pH value; consequently, viscosity measurements indicated the breaking of the fluid viscosity after the addition of the chelating agent. This paper contributes to the understanding of the main factors that enable the use of produced water for hydraulic-fracturing operations. Maximizing the use of produced water could reduce water-disposal costs, mitigate environmental impacts, and solve freshwater-acquisition challenges. "

Although water-based fluids are widely used in the oil industry as one of the most-economic hydraulic-fracturing methods, foam is another viable alternative to fracture water-sensitive reservoirs where damage to pore throats is caused by swelling clays or fines migration. CO2 foam not only reduces formation damage by minimizing the quantity of aqueous fluid that enters the formation, but also significantly improves sweep efficiency. Even though surfactant is commonly used to generate stable foam in high-temperature and high-salinity environments, such foam can degrade in these harsh conditions. The main objective of this study is to improve the stability of CO2 foam by use of a mixture of CO2/alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) solution with nanoparticles, guar gum, or viscoelastic surfactants (VESs). Foam stability is studied for various solutions by the use of a high-pressure view-chamber (HPVC) setup to find the optimal surfactant and nanoparticle concentration at which higher foam stability in the CO2 foam system can be reached. In addition to surfactant and nanoparticle concentration, the effects of temperature, pressure, and salinity on foam stability were studied. Temperature ranged from 75 to 212°F, and pressure increased from atmospheric to 800 psi. AOS solutions were prepared with brine and surfactant concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 10 wt% of NaCl and zero to 1 wt% of AOS. Temperature and pressure had a negative effect on the foam stability when AOS solutions were used. However, nanoparticles improved the foam stability for AOS, AOS and guar gum, and AOS with VES solutions. "

                    "title": "Smart Magnetic Drilling Fluid With In-Situ Rheological Controllability Using Fe3O4 Nanoparticles",
                    "abstract": "Engineering a drilling fluid tailored to meet specific downhole and environmental demands with tunable rheological properties can revolutionize the drilling industry. This study investigates magnetically controllable, water-based drilling fluid systems containing custom-made (CM) iron oxide (Fe3O4) magnetic nanoparticles (NP). These could potentially offer in-situ control of the drilling fluid viscosity and yield stress, under the application of an external magnetic field. CM Fe3O4 NP were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. NP were added to the base fluid at two different concentrations (0.5 and 1.0 wt%). The magnetorheological properties were analyzed via a strain- controlled rheometer equipped with a magnetic field source in parallel-plate geometry giving a range of magnetic flux densities of up to 1 Tesla (T). The rheological behavior of the produced fluids was examined at room temperature of 25°C as a function of volume fraction, shear rate and magnetic field strength. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the NP was spherical with mean diameter of 6-8 nm, while the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern revealed peaks corresponding to pure crystallites of magnetite (Fe3O4) with no impurities. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) analysis proved that the prepared NP displayed superparamagnetic behavior. Magneto- rheological measurements of the nanofluids indicated increase in the yield stress of up to +75% upon exposure to a magnetic field of 0.1 T, while larger changes of up to +609% were observed for higher concentrations of NP with intensities up to 0.7 T. The viscosity of the nanofluids monotonically increased under the presence of a magnetic field at all shear rates. The original rheological profile of the developed fluids was recovered upon removal of the magnetic field with an average deviation of +20% from the initial value, reflecting the disintegration of particle chains because of random movements due to Brownian forces. Results highlight the potential for the development of multifunctional smart fluids that are greener and economical with tailor-made properties that can reversibly modify their rheological characteristics. Their unique ability to withstand a rapid increase in the viscosity and yield stress in the presence of an external magnetic field could enable drillers to formulate drilling fluid systems with instantaneous responses to continuously changing drilling environment, leading to enhanced well control and contributing to decreased non-productive time and costs.

                    "title": "The Role of Sandstone Mineralogy and Rock Quality in the Performance of Low-Salinity Waterflooding",
                    "abstract": "Recent field applications and laboratory studies have recognized that low-salinity waterflooding (LSW) is a potentially effective technique to achieve sufficient recovery in sandstone reservoirs. Researchers have noted that the impacts of clay content, rock permeability, and pore-throat radius are still unclear on the performance of LSW. This paper reports the results of coreflood, zeta-potential, X-ray-powder-diffraction (XRD), X-ray-fluorescence (XRF), scanning-electron-microscope (SEM), nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR), and high-pressure-mercury-injection experimental investigations on these parameters. The main objectives of this work are to examine the performance of LSW by use of four sandstone rocks during secondary- and tertiary-recovery modes; to investigate the role of clay content, rock permeability, and average pore-throat radius on the performance of LSW; and to evaluate the effects of mineral type, brine salinity, cation type, and pH on the zeta-potential measurements. Zeta-potential measurements were conducted for rock/brine interfaces to determine the suitable injection brine for the used sandstone rocks. Various brines were used, including seawater (SW), 20% diluted SW, 0.5 wt% NaCl, 0.5 wt% MgCl2, and 0.5 wt% CaCl2. Then, a set of comprehensive coreflood tests were conducted with Bandera, Parker, Gray Berea, and Buff Berea outcrop sandstone cores. The coreflood experiments were conducted with 6- and 20-in.-length and 1.5-in.-diameter outcrop cores at 185°F. Oil recovery, pressure drop, and pH were observed and analyzed after each coreflood experiment. On the basis of the results attained, the Parker, Bandera, Gray Berea, and Buff Berea sandstone cores showed additional oil recoveries of 4.3, 9.2, 13.3, and 17.1% of original oil in place (OOIP), respectively, through the injection of low-salinity brine (5,000 ppm NaCl) as the secondary recovery mode. The average pore-throat radius (rock quality) has a higher effect in the performance of LSW than in high-salinity waterflooding (HSW) on the secondary recovery mode. The incremental oil recovery (microscopic) for the LSW increased from 4.3 to 17% when the average pore-throat radius (R35) of the core increased from 1.4 to 8.5 μm. The total clay content and the clay composition are not the main factors that influence the LSW performance. The distribution of the clays seems to be playing a significant role. The measured zeta potentials of kaolinite and montmorillonite particles in 5,000 ppm NaCl brine at 77°F and pH 7 were 26.5 and 29.4 mV, respectively. The zeta-potential values indicated a stronger negative charge on muscovite and albite minerals of 33.8 and 31.5 mV, respectively. Zeta-potential values indicated a less-negative charge on the chlorite and illite particles than the other minerals. It seems that chlorite and illite contribute to a smaller electrical-double-layer expansion than those of kaolinite, feldspars, montmorillonite, and muscovite. On the other hand, the zeta-potential values of calcite and dolomite particles are 1.0 and 4.5 mV, respectively. The presence of dolomite and calcite would decrease the effect of the low-salinity brine to improve oil recovery. "

                    "title": "Laboratory Investigations To Determine the Effect of Connate-Water Composition on Low-Salinity Waterflooding in Sandstone Reservoirs",
                    "abstract": "Most previous low-salinity-waterflooding studies focused on injection-brine salinity and composition. The question remains: How do the salinity and composition of the reservoir connate water (CW) affect the low-salinity-waterflooding performance? The main objectives of this work are to evaluate the potential of low salinity waterflooding (LSW) on the performance of oil recovery improvement by use of Buff Berea sandstone and Bandera sandstone cores; examine the effect of the salinity of the reservoir CW; investigate the role of the cation composition (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) of the reservoir CW; and study the effect of temperature and pore-throat distribution on the performance of LSW. In this research, 11 spontaneous-imbibition (SI) experiments and six coreflood experiments were performed. Two sandstone types (Bandera and Buff Berea) with different mineralogy compositions were used. Furthermore, ζ-potential measurements were conducted for oil/brine interfaces to investigate the interaction between brine and crude oil interfaces. In addition, coreflood experiments were performed to validate the SI results and examine the effect of the CW-salinity variation. The reservoir-CW composition had a dominant influence on the oil-recovery rate. The changes in the cation composition of reservoir CW (Ca2+, Mg2+, and Na+) showed a measurable change in the oil-production trend. Reservoir cores saturated with CW containing divalent cations of Ca+2 and Mg+2 showed higher oil recovery than cores saturated with monovalent cations (Na+). The results demonstrate that the SI produced oil ranging from 38 to 69% of original oil in place (OOIP) for high-permeability Buff Berea cores (164–207.7 md), whereas the produced oil of the low permeability Bandera cores (31.1–39.2 md) ranged from 20 to 51.5% of OOIP at 77°F and 14.7 psia. In all cases, a measurable ion exchange was observed, whereas there was no significant change in the pH value of the imbibition brine during the experiments. The ion-exchange effect was more pronounced than the pH effect in the low-salinity-waterflooding performance for Buff Berea and Bandera sandstone. The total oil recovery increased from 51.9 to 58.9% OOIP when the divalent-cation (Ca+2 and Mg+2) concentration of the reservoir CW increased from 709 to 12,210 ppm for injected-brine salinity of 500 and 5,000 ppm, respectively. On the other hand, increasing the monovalent-cation (Na+) concentration from 610 to 54,400 ppm resulted in a slight increase in oil recovery (2.3% of OOIP). "

                    "abstract": "Commercial hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (NPs) had been used as additives to develop smart drilling fluids. Both types of NPs were found to enhance the properties of such fluids. This work focuses on using a custom-made (CM) magnetite (Fe3O4) NPs to improve the properties of bentonite-based fluids. The microstructure qualities and mode of interaction have indentified, which help in optimizing the rheological and fluid loss properties of drilling fluids. Rheological properties of the tested fluids were measured using a rotational viscometer at different temperatures up to 60°C (140°F) and atmospheric pressure. Step-change shear rate measurements revealed the degree of thixotropy of the produced suspensions. Fluid loss characteristics were examined under 20.7 bar (300 psi) and 121°C (250°F). Both rheological and fluid loss measurements were also conducted using fluids that are thermally aged at 177°C (350°F) for 16 hrs. Filter cake surface morphology was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Bentonite composition was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer was used to measure the magnetic properties of the CM Fe3O4 NPs, and their size was determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CM Fe3O4 NPs, which were synthesized by co-precipitation method, have average diameter of 6-8 nm, as indicated by TEM. Magnetic measurements revealed their superparamagnetic behaviour with saturation magnetization of 60 emu/g. For all the tested samples, the Herschel-Bulkley (HB) model was determined to be the best fit model with good correlation coefficient (R2 > 0.99). Yield stress, viscosity, and gel strength of the tested fluids showed significant improvement when adding the CM Fe3O4NPs, which could be a result of the rigid network formed. A linear dependence of yield stress on temperature of the produced nanofluids (NF) was identified. Adding the CM Fe3O4 NPs at 0.5 wt% showed optimal rheological and filtration characteristics. Dynamic thermal aging adversely affects the properties of base fluid. However, the NF maintained its extraordinary rheological and filtration behavior. SEM-EDS analysis revealed the microstructure of the produced filter cake. The better performance of the CM Fe3O4 NPs can be attributed to their extremely small size, which confer stability in suspensions and effective linking with the bentonite particles, thus allowing the formation of a rigid microstructure network. Such approach introduces the synergistic interaction of components to produce a water-based drilling fluid system with excellent fluid loss characteristics and optimal rheological properties for HP/HT applicaltions.

                    "abstract": "The highly sensitive clay presence in both Berea and Kentucky sandstone during various stimulation operations makes them some critical formations when fines migration is addressed. Berea sandstone at 1% total clay content, although its low percentage it is proven to be determinate with double and quadruple permeability reduction upon fresh water exposure. Regular mud acid is known for its dissolving power of the alumino silicate minerals, yet the secondary and tertiary reaction still cast a damaging potential on the sandstone formation especially in presence of fines migration. This work aims to understand how those fines migration interacts with conventional HCl pre-flush and regular mud acid treatment in the Berea sandstone. Also, the impact of the hydrofluoric acid aided with formic acid preflush was examined to assess the clay content on the stimulation outcomes. This work based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis; it was designed to understand experimentally the fundamentals of fines migration process and further investigate its behavior during acidizing process. Core flood test was conducted on 6 in. by 1.5 in. cores and fresh water was injected at 3 cm3/min to induce fines migration. In total three core flood tests were conducted after the cores were damaged by fines migration and at temperatures of 150 and 250°F. All cores were subjected to a 12 wt% HCl preflush followed by regular mud acid at a flow rate 3 cm3/min. Each core was scanned using NMR, and computed tomography (CT-scan) to assess the fines migration quantity and distribution mechanism before and after their induction; and once more scanned after acidizing process. All of this work was repeated for cores from Kentucky sandstone to investigate the sensitivity to the clay content. The acidizing process in presence of fines migration was proven to be temperature sensitive. The NMR analysis showed one order of magnitude reduction in the dominant pore size in the last two inches of the core at 150°F for Berea sandstone. At the higher temperature of 250°F the damage was more clear in the last four inches of the core. The CT-scan analysis followed the NMR analysis showing the same pattern in terms of porosity gain percentage that was higher at 150 compared to 250°F. The mud acid failed to dissolve the fines and the damage persist and resulted in a drop in permeability, total porosity, and tighter pore size distribution. On the other hand, although Kentucky formation exhibited high clay content the extent of damage was minor after acidizing in presence of fines migration. In the end this work will add a further insight on the effect of clay content and nature on the acidizing process in both Berea and Kentucky sandstone. The NMR study showed how fines migration moves in the damaged cores. Furthermore, it will localize and quantify their damage and impact on stimulated formations. Finally, the work will add clearer understanding to how fines migration reacts with the preflush and regular mud acid. "

                    "title": "Modeling of Wormhole Propagation During Matrix Acidizing of Carbonate Reservoirs by Organic Acids and Chelating Agents",
                    "abstract": "Numerous carbonate matrix acidizing models have been developed to study the flow and reaction of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) in calcite, but there is a significant gap in the literature for models built to investigate wormhole propagation by alternative acidizing fluids such as organic acids and chelants. In this work, a model is developed to study wormhole propagation by these alternative fluids, using the two-scale carbonate acidizing model approach with Navier-Stokes formulation for fluid-flow description. The reaction kinetics used for acetic acid (HAc) in the model is modified to account for the slight dissociation of the weak acid in aqueous solution and a fractional order of reaction. The output from the model is compared with available experimental data in the literature for qualitative and quantitative validation. This study extends the linear first-order reaction kinetics used for HCl in previous two-scale models for the chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), with updated dissolution rate constants and dispersion coefficients, and the output compared with experimental data for qualitative validation. The acid efficiency curves generated from the model for acetic acid compares qualitatively and quantitatively with reported experimental data, and the numerical simulations show that a higher amount of acid will be required to reach breakthrough for acetic acid than for HCl, as expected. The model output for the chelating agents does not match quantitatively with experimental data, but the qualitative trend can be observed from the numerical simulation results. The updated reaction kinetics for acetic acid is extendable to formic acid, which is the other commonly used organic acid in carbonate matrix acidizing, to obtain an equally dependable model output. However, a more complex reaction kinetics will be required to model the multi-step chemistry that occurs in the dissolution of carbonate by chelating agents. The model developed in this study accurately captures the wormholing phenomena by acetic acid, and it can also be used to predict optimum injection rates for organic acids. The simulation results also show that the model, based on Navier-Stokes momemtum formulation, is computationally less expensive than previous models with the Darcy-Brinkman formulation, and simulations at very high injection rates with this model require less computational time than models developed with the Darcy formulation.

                    "abstract": "Low-salinity waterflooding has been an emerging EOR/IOR technique in the recent times. LSW-alternating-CO2 injection has been particularly strong in yielding higher oil recoveries in some cases. Limited simulation studies haven been performed to properly exhibit the interpretation of experimental studies in this area. Low permeability sandstones of significant clay content, and heavy west Texas crude oil with 29 °API were targetted for evaluating the potentials of LSWF and CO2 flooding. Coreflood experiments were conducted and interpreted by reservoir simulation, which enabled a better understanding of the underlying science of the studied IOR and EOR techniques. Five secondary waterflooding experiments and two LSW, CO2 hybrid processes were performed using aged 3 in. outcrop grey bandera sandstone cores. The wettability of the rock was tested using axisymmetric contact angle measurements to study the effect of injected brine salinity. The interfacial tension values were measured for the different brines and heavy crude oil systems. The corefloods were interpreted using reservoir simulation, by history matching the experimental oil RF and the pressure drop across the core. A detailed focus was laid on interpretation of SCAL relative permeability curves for the various waterflooding operations, by comparing curves generated from published correlations, history matched curves by simulation and that by Corey's correlations. Fines migration and viscosity override of low salinity waters over heavy oil were highly influential on the oil recovery profile during low salinity waterflooding. Wettability alteration proved as effective during low salinity waterflooding, for longer injection and production periods. Corey's exponents were found to be premature indications of rock wettability during LSWF, proving importance and reliability of experimental wettability characterization. Low-salinity wateflooding proved to be marginally effective than conventional waterflooding for sandstones with high clay contents and low permeabilities. Low permeability sandstone reservoirs proved as great targets for Hybrid EOR techniques utilizing CO2 and LSW. "

                    "abstract": "Low-salinity waterflooding (LSW) is an enhanced technique that improves oil recovery by lowering and optimizing the salinity of injected water. Previous research demonstrated that the initial water saturation and oil aging during LSW affect oil recovery. This work aims to validate and quantify these effects. This laboratory study investigated the effect of injected brine, initial water saturation, and crude oil aging on relative permeability and low-salinity waterflooding performance in sandstone reservoirs. A set of comprehensive coreflood tests have been conducted using 3? Bandera sandstone cores to examine the effect of initial water saturation and injection brine on the relative permeability curves. Additionally, six coreflood experiments were conducted to examine the effect of the connate water salinity variation on the relative permeability end points. Four spontaneous imbibition experiments were performed using 6 in. length Buff Berea sandstone samples to investigate the effect of initial water saturation and aging on the performance outcome of low-salinity waterflooding. Two spontaneous imbibitions were performed using 20 in. length core samples. The objective of these two experiments was to study the effect of initial water saturation distribution across the core on the oil production using X-ray computed tomography. Results obtained from coreflood and spontaneous imbibition tests suggest injected brine and initial water saturation have predominant influence on the oil recovery performance. As the initial water saturation increased from 23 to 41%, the oil recovery increased from 43.8 to 48.4% of OOIP using low-salinity waterflooding. Comparison between the high-salinity relative permeability and low-salinity water relative permeability showed that the end-point water relative permeability slightly decreased for the cores after using low-salinity brine as injected brine compared to the end-point water relative permeability after flooding with high-salinity brine for Bandera sandstone. The end-point relative permeability to water increased from 0.07 to 0.39 when the reservoir connate water salinity increased from 4,633 to 174,156 ppm for injected brine salinity of 500 and 5,000 ppm, respectively for Buff Berea sandstone. The un-aged core plugs with higher initial water saturation provided oil recovery higher than that with lower initial water saturation by 5% of OOIP for the low-salinity waterflooding. "

                    "abstract": "Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) has been used as a retarding agent for mud acid for a long time; its applications are studied in the laboratory and tested in the field. The theory and mechanism of AlCl3 retardation were investigated in many works involving mud acidizing and reservoir-permeability enhancement. This paper furthers this investigation with solubility tests, coreflood tests, and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to better understand the mechanism of AlCl3 working as a retarding agent in mud acid. The reactivity of Al-based retarded mud acid (15 wt% HCl, 1.5 wt% HF, and 5 wt% AlCl3.6H2O) with clay minerals and sandstones at different conditions has not been examined fully. To enhance the acid performance and to minimize formation damage, a systematic investigation of the interactions between the Al-based retarded mud acid and clay minerals in sandstone reservoirs is provided in this study. Furthermore, for the first time, 19F NMR spectroscopy was used to follow the reactions of Al-based retarded mud acid with clay minerals. Solubility tests were performed to evaluate the retardation of the Al-based retarded mud acid when reacted with kaolinite, bentonite, and illite. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and 19F NMR were used to analyze the concentrations of key cations and components in the supernatant, whereas the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were used to identify the reaction products and to explore the possibility of the presence of any precipitation. Coreflood tests of sandstone cores were also conducted. This study shows that AlCl3 can retard the reaction of hydrofluoric acid (HF) with kaolinite, bentonite, or illite at 75 and 200°F in Al-based retarded mud acid. Even with 5 wt% AlCl3.6H2O added in the acid system, no AlF3 precipitate was observed in any of the solubility tests. 19F NMR results showed that AlF–4 and AlF3 were the only Al-F species existing in the spent Al-based retarded mud acid. H2SiF6 and HSiF5 were also identified. Coreflood tests showed significant permeability improvement to Berea sandstone when Al-based retarded mud acid was used, and the enhancement diminished when the temperature increased to 300°F. Computed-tomography (CT) scan showed deeper penetration of Al-based retarded mud acid than mud acid at 75°F, and the penetration reduced when temperature increased to 200°F. On the basis of these results, new mechanisms were developed to better understand the reaction of Al-based retarded mud acid and clay minerals. "

                    "abstract": "In highly heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs, several acid systems were used to enhance acid diversion during matrix-acidizing treatments. Viscosified acid with polymer increases the viscosity of the acid system to improve the wellbore coverage. However, the injection of such acid at low rates had a negative effect on the spending rate and starts filter-cake formation, which inhibits the wormhole growth. On the other hand, relatively low-viscosity emulsified acid is diffusion-retarded, which makes it an effective wormholing agent at the low injection rates that occur, for example, in low-permeability or damaged formations. None of the studies in the literature addresses an acid system that uses both advantages. The objective of this work was to investigate the behavior and the performance of a new acid system, polymer-assisted emulsified acid, as a self-diverting acid by conducting viscosity measurements through coreflood study and acid-diversion experiments. The system was 15 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl)-gelled acid emulsified in diesel with a 70:30 acid/diesel volume ratio. Coreflood experiments with Indiana limestone were conducted at 230°F at different injection rates, and the core samples were imaged with a computed-tomography (CT) scan technique after each coreflood experiment. Also, 0.5 pore volumes (PV) of the polymer-assisted emulsified acid was injected to assess the effect of the acid on the permeability of the cores before breakthrough. Finally, two acid-diversion experiments at 1 cm3/min were conducted into pairs of low- and high-permeability cores to test the effect of polymer concentration in the acid internal phase on diversion. The viscosity measurements and acid-diffusivity measurements showed that increasing the polymer concentration in the acid internal phase of the emulsified acid from 0 to 1.5 vol% significantly enhanced the viscosity of the emulsified acid and reduced the diffusion coefficient by one order of magnitude. Coreflood results showed that the polymer-assisted emulsified acid was an effective wormholing fluid at low injection rates while maintaining the high viscosity of the acid system for zonal coverage. Also, it was shown that the emulsion/polymer retention was the main source for permeability damage. However, flowback with mutual solvent removed any remaining damage, and permeability enhancement was achieved. Acid-diversion experiments are presented that show the self-diverting ability of the polymer-assisted emulsified acid into the low-permeability cores. "

                    "abstract": "Viscoelastic surfactants (VES) have been used to replace polymer-based fluids as effective, cleaner, and non-damaging viscofying carriers in frac-packing, acid fracturing, and matrix acidizing. However, several limitations challenge the use of VES-based fluids including: thermal instability, incompatibility with alcohol-based corrosion inhibitor, and intolerance to the presence of contaminating iron. This work introduces a new VES-based acid system for diversion in matrix acidizing that exhibits excellent thermal stability and diversion performance in both low-and high-temperature conditions. Rheology measurements were conducted on spent VES-acid system as a function of temperature (77- 300°F) at a pH of 4-5. The effect of acidizing additives on the VES viscosity was investigated. The additives included a corrosion inhibitor, non-emulsifier, iron-chelating agent, and iron-reducing agent. Single and dual coreflood experiments were performed using limestone core samples with an initial permeability range of 4-200 md and a permeability contrast of 1.5-55. Post CT-scan imaging was conducted to investigate the wormhole topography. The diversion characteristic of the new VES in the dual coreflood experiments was evaluated by the structure and the extent of wormhole propagation in the low-permeability core. Rheological data for 15 wt% HCl spent VES-solutions showed a maximum viscosity of 200-800 over a temperature range of 150-170°F, depending on the VES concentration in the sample. Without acidizing additives, a minimum of 50 cP was obtained at 195, 230, 250, and 275°F at 4, 5, 6, and 8 vol% of the VES in solution, respectively. None of the tested acidizing additives had a negative impact on the VES viscosity. At 8% VES loading, the acidizing package was optimized such that a minimum of 75 cP was obtained at 300°F. Dual coreflood experiments were conducted at 150 and 250°F, and the results proved the ability of the proposed VES to divert efficiently in limestone formations. Single coreflood experiments also confirmed these results. Coreflood data indicated that a range of permeability contrast of 4-10 is the optimum for diversion ability in terms of the final permeability enhancement of the low-permeability cores. The results revealed 18.6, 45.6, 82%, and infinity when the permeability contrast was 28.3, 14.4, 6. 3, 1.63, respectively. A dual coreflood experiment was conducted for two cores with a permeability contrast of 1.6 at 150°F. The VES-acid system in the presence of all acidizing additives exhibited divergent performance that exceeded the performance of the VES in the absence of additivies. These results prove the stable performance of the VES and the enhancement in viscosity response after addition of both the iron-control agent and the non-emulsfier, which resulted in less acid leakoff and better wormhole structure.

                    "abstract": "Friction reducers (FRs) are crucial components in any slickwater fracturing fluid. Revising the previous literature showed that the majority of research focused on evaluating the friction-reduction performance of these chemicals. Another important aspect, which a few studies addressed, is the potential damage friction reducers can cause, especially to low-permeability formations. Friction reducers are polymeric in nature (typically polyacrylamide); therefore, they can either filter out onto the surface of the formation or penetrate deeply to plug the pores. Breaking these polymers at temperatures lower than 200°F remains a challenge. This work evaluates a non-damaging and breakable friction reducer that can be a replacement for liner gel with enhanced proppant-carrying capacity. Friction-reduction performance, proppant settling, breakability, and coreflood experiments were conducted to investigate the new friction reducer (FR1) in terms of friction-reduction, breakability, and the potential damage it might cause to tight sandstone cores at 150°F. The results of the new friction reducers were compared against two conventional friction reducers; one polyacrylamide-based (FR2), and one guar-based (FR3). Different breakers were used to examine the breakability performance; ammonium persulfate (APS), sodium persulfate (SPS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and sodium bromate (SB). The friction reduction of the new chemical was always higher than 65% in both fresh water and 2 wt% KCl. The presence of calcium chloride did not affect the friction-reduction performance, compared to performance reduction in the cases of FR2 and FR3. The presence of 1 gpt of different types of breakers did not affect the friction-reduction performance, even for stronger breaker (friction-reduction performance was 67% with APS breaker comparing to 68.5 % with no breaker). The new friction reducer is easily breakable in the three tested breakers: ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, and hydrogen peroxide. Among the three, ammonium persulfate was the most efficient breaker. Static and dynamic proppant settling tests indicated a superior performance of FR1 compared to the other conventional friction reducer (FR2). Coreflood experiments showed that the new friction reducer FR1 did not result in any formation damage with APS breaker at low KCl concentration (5 wt%) and high KCl concentration (20 wt%). A 9% formation damage was observed at weaker breaker (SB), comparing to 47 and 41.5% damage when the other two conventional friction reducers FR2 and FR3 were tested, respectively. The proposed friction reducer has higher friction-reduction performance and better proppant-carrying capacity with no formation damage compared to the conventional friction reducers. "

                    "title": "The Effect of Chelating Agents on the Use of Produced Water in Crosslinked-Gel-Based Hydraulic Fracturing",
                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing operations require large amount of water which, in some cases, could reach six million gallons per treatment. Fresh water, from surface and subsurface sources, is usually used to formulate the fracturing fluid. The use of produced water in hydraulic fracturing has gained increased attention in the last few years, as it would solve fresh water acquisition challenges and reduces its disposal costs. However, produced water usually contains high amounts of total dissolved solids (TDS) that prevents its compatibility with fracturing fluid additives and negatively affects the fracturing fluid rheology. This paper investigates the effect of different chelating agents on the use of high-TDS produced water in high pH borate-crosslinked gels used in hydraulic fracturing fluids. Samples of field-produced water were analyzed for different ion concentrations. Synthetic water was prepared with different amounts of Na, K, Ca, and Mg salts. The fracturing fluid was formulated using natural guar polymer, borate-based crosslinker, biocide, surfactant, clay controller, scale inhibitor, and pH buffer. Five chelating agents tested in this study included HEDTA, GLDA, di-sodium EDTA, di-ammonium EDTA, and sodium gluconate. Compatibility tests of the fluid system at 180ºF were conducted at different ion concentrations. Apparent viscosity of the fracturing fluid was measured using a high-pressure high-temperature rotational rheometer. All rheology tests were conducted at a temperature of 180ºF and were conducted according to API 13m procedure with a three-hour test duration. Results indicated the potentiality of high-TDS water to cause precipitate and, hence, formation damage. However, the use of chelating agents has reduced the precipitation of divalent cations and enabled the formulation of fracturing fluid at higher Ca and Mg concentrations. The use of 2.5 wt% of HEDTA has enabled the formulation of the fracturing fluid using synthetic produced water that contains TDS of 101,000 ppm with Ca and Mg concentrations of 2,500 and 200 ppm, respectively. The fracturing fluid showed an average viscosity of 150 cp at 100 s-1 despite the high-TDS and high-hardness environment. The use of GLDA reduced the Ca and Mg ion precipitation; however, its chelation effect was found to be limited to certain concentrations. Some chelating agents showed the ability to chelate the boron ion and/or reduce the system's pH value. Consequently, viscosity measurements indicated the breaking of the fluid viscosity after the addition of the chelating agent. This paper presents the use of chelating agents to maximize the effectiveness of produced water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Successful use of chelating agents would reduce produced water disposal costs and improve the environment by reducing the consumption of fresh water. "

                    "title": "Laboratory Studies on Fluid-Recovery Enhancement and Mitigation of Phase Trapping by Use of Microemulsion in Gas Sandstone Formations",
                    "abstract": "One of the challenges in slickwater fracturing of gas reservoirs is post-treatment fluid recovery. More than 60% of the injected fluid remains in the critical near-wellbore region and has a significant negative impact on the relative permeability to gas and well productivity. The trapping of water could be caused by capillary forces around the fractured formation. Commonly available surfactants are added to slickwater to reduce surface tension between the treating fluids and gas. The problem with surfactants is that, upon exposure to the formation, they adsorb on the surface of the rock. The addition of microemulsions to the fracturing fluids can result in a reduction in the pressure needed to displace injected fluids and/or condensate from the formations. This alteration of the fracturing fluid effectively reduces the capillary forces in the near-wellbore region, and in the case of fracturing, the fluids that have been trapped in the region surrounding the fracture. This will result in the removal of water and condensate blocks, as well as the mitigation of phase trapping, and therefore, an increase in permeability to gas. This paper examines the effectiveness of microemulsions in the improvement of fluid recovery by use of sandstone cores with permeability greater then 10 md. Compatibility tests were performed for microemulsions to investigate their compatibility with the condensate and stability upon dilution with brine. One microemulsion showed incompatibility and was excluded from further experiments. Coreflood runs that used 20-in. Bandera sandstine cores with permeabilities greater than 10 md showed that the improvement factor in effective gas permeability because of treatment with microemulsions was up to 2.5, depending on the type of microemulsion. Thermal stability tests were performed on microemulsions, and the results showed stability of the microemulsions at high temperatures up to 400°F. A newly developed microemulsion (Nguyen 2013) that was formulated with a blend of anionic and nonionic surfactants, short-chain alcohol, oil, and water was tested and showed a significant reduction in the surface tension between water and nitrogen gas when compared with mutual-solvent and fluoropolymer-surfactant solutions. Among the tested chemicals, ME-V with a contact angle of 63.4° had the lowest capillary pressure, which makes this microemulsion the best treatment fluid among the four chemicals tested for gas-permeability enhancement and cleanup of the fluid in the near-wellbore region. The resulting capillary pressure for the fracture fluid treated with 0.25 wt% of this chemical in 2 wt% KCl is nearly six times lower than that of the untreated fluid with no microemulsion. "

                    "abstract": "Wettability of the rock is an important parameter in determining oil recovery. It determines the fluid behavior and the fluid distribution in the reservoir. Aging of the rock changes the wettability of the rock and can affect the residual oil saturation. This paper investigates the effect of aging on the oil recovery during the Water-Alternating-CO2 injection (WACO2) process using 20 in. outcrop Grey Berea sandstone cores under immiscible conditions. In the present work, two coreflood experiments were performed. Both cores were aged for a period of 30 days at 149°F. This study is a continued research and compares the performance of WACO2 injection in aged cores to previously published work with unaged cores. All experiments were done at 500 psi and in the secondary recovery mode. The wettability of the Rock- Brine-CO2-Oil system for aged cores was determined by contact angle measurements using formation brine (174,156 ppm), seawater brine (54,680 ppm) and low-salinity brine (5,000 ppm NaCl). The interfacial tension (IFT) of the Brine-Oil-N2 and Brine-Oil-CO2 system was also measured using the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) method. Computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained for each core in its various states: dry state, 100% water-saturated state, oil saturated state with irreducible water saturation, and residual oil-saturated state. The CT scans were used to determine the porosity profile of the cores. The contact angle measurements of the Rock - Brine - CO2 - Oil system indicated an increase in contact angles after the aging of the cores. Low-salinity brine showed the most water-wet state (55°) and seawater brine showed the most oil-wet state (96°) of the rock. This may be because of the increased concentration of divalent ions on the surface of the rock during seawater brine injection. Ion binding is the dominant mechanism in the oil-wet nature of the rock. The previously published work stated that the coreflood experiments of the unaged cores resulted in an oil recovery of 61.7 and 64.6% OOIP during low-salinity water-alternating-CO2 and seawater-alternating-CO2 injection, respectively. In aged cores, the oil recovery increased to 97.7 and 76.1% OOIP during the low-salinity water-alternating-CO2 and seawater-alternating-CO2 injection, respectively. The improved oil recovery was attributed to the wettability alteration when the rock was aged. The interfacial tension measurements of brine/oil/nitrogen and brine/oil/CO2 systems showed that the salinity of the brine had an effect on the IFT. Low-salinity brine (5,000 ppm) yielded the highest IFT values and seawater brine produced the least. Monovalent ions had a weak effect on the interfacial activity between the oil and the brine. When multivalent ions were present, the IFT values were influenced by the salting effect of the brines. During the IFT measurements of brine/oil/CO2 system, the IFT values showed an increasing trend as a function of time and then stabilized. The increase in IFT was because of the initial mass transfer between the CO2, brine, and oil phases. "

                    "abstract": "Fracturing fluids are commonly formulated with fresh water to ensure reliable rheology. However, fresh water is becoming more costly, and in some areas, it is difficult to obtain. Therefore, using produced water in hydraulic fracturing has received increased attention in the last few years. A major challenge, however, is its high total dissolved solids (TDS) content, which could cause formation damage and negatively affect fracturing fluid rheology. The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using produced water to formulate crosslinked-gel-based fracturing fluid. This paper focuses on the compatibility of water with the fracturing fluid system and the effect of salts on the fluid rheology. Produced water samples were analyzed to determine different ion concentrations. Solutions of synthetic water with different amounts of salts were prepared. The fracturing fluid system consisted of natural guar polymer, borate-based crosslinker, biocide, surfactant, clay controller, scale inhibitor, and pH buffer. Compatibility tests of the fluid system were conducted at different cation concentrations. Apparent viscosity of the fracturing fluid was measured using a high-pressure high-temperature rotational rheometer. All rheology tests were conducted at a temperature of 180°F and were conducted according to API 13m procedure with a three-hour test duration. Fluid breaking test was also performed to ensure high fracture and proppant pack conductivity. Produced water analysis showed a TDS content of 125,000 ppm, including Na, Ca, K, and Mg ion concentrations of 36,000, 10,500, 1,700, and 700 ppm, respectively. Results indicated the potential of produced water to cause formation damage. Therefore, produced water was diluted with fresh water and directly used to formulate the fracturing fluid. Divalent cations were found to be the main source of precipitation, and the reduced amounts of each ion were determined to prevent precipitation. The separate and combined effects of Na, K, Ca, and Mg ions on the viscosity of the fracturing fluid were also studied. Fluid viscosity was found to be significantly affected by the concentrations of divalent cations regardless of the concentrations of monovalent cations. Monovalent cations reduced the viscosity of fracturing fluid only in the absence of divalent cations, and showed no effect in the presence of Ca and Mg ions. Water with reduced concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations showed the most suitable environment for polymer hydration and crosslinking. This paper contributes to the understanding of the main factors that enable the use of produced water for hydraulic fracturing operations. Maximizing the use of produced water could reduce its disposal costs, mitigate environmental impacts, and solve fresh water acquisition challenges. "

                    "abstract": "The production and transportation of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil are two of the paramount concerns in the oil industry due to the difficulties associated with heavy crude oil high viscosity. One of the most efficient techniques to improve the recovery and the transportability of such oil is to reduce its viscosity through dilution that can be applied solely or via thermal methods. In the present work, a new type of plant-based diluent is proposed, and its efficacy in heavy oil viscosity reduction for different concentrations, temperatures and shear rates is studied. Various concentrations of diluent, ranging from 5 to 25 wt%, are added to heavy-oil samples with different concentrations of asphaltene and viscosity, ranging from 48000 to 65000 cp in ambient temperature. A rotational viscometer was then employed to the measure viscosity of the prepared samples at the temperature range of 70 to 190°F and a shear rate of 3 to 50 s-1. The application of the proposed diluent led to promising results in that in caused the viscosity of the heavy oil samples to reduce by 93% in 75°F and 85% in 190°F with 20 wt% of diluent. To compare the performance of the proposed solvent and the common viscosity-reducing solvents, heavy oil samples were diluted with xylene and toluene with the same concentrations. Results indicated that the application of proposed diluent outperformed all of the commonly used solvents in terms of decreasing viscosity. The application of 20 wt% of the proposed diluent led to a 93% viscosity reduction of the heavy oil samples, which is 15% more than efficiency of adding the same concentration of toluene. The proposed diluent is a plant-based, non-hazardous substitute to the conventional hazardous diluents, e.g., xylene or toluene, that provides more efficient viscosity reduction compared to its conventional alternatives. Its flashpoint is higher than that of light crude resulting in less evaporation at high temperatures thus a longer period of reduced viscosity can be obtained. Furthermore, due to its high flashpoint, the proposed diluent can be employed in thermal methods more efficiently. "

                    "abstract": "Managing the solid flocculation in high-density drilling fluids is a challenge in drilling operations. A weighting material such as manganese tetroxide is used to formulate drilling fluids at density requirements for deep drilling because of its high specific gravity (i.e. 4.8). However, the microsized particles, surface charge, and presence of biopolymers increase the tendency to agglomerate and, thus, promote sagging. Developing a good dispersant is critical for a successful drilling operation, especially in HP/HT conditions. The dispersion of Mn3O4 particles in aqueous solutions was evaluated through visual transparency testing and a PC-2200 Spectrek laser particle analyzer. A Mastersizer 2000 was used to obtain the particle size distribution and specific surface area of Mn3O4 particles. TGA and variable speed mixers were used to assess the thermal stability and compatibility. Rheology and sagging tendency were evaluated using a Fan 35A viscometer and density variation measurements. The microstructure of Mn3O4-based filter cake was interpreted through SEM to identify the aggregation of solid particles. The effect of CaCl2 on the solubility and dispersion of Mn3O4 particles in aqueous dispersant solutions was considered in the experimental study. The drilling fluids were aged at 400°F. Several dispersants showed high potential to disperse manganese tetroxide particles in water-based drilling fluids. The dispersants examined showed particle settling times from 0.03 to 24 hours. Zeta potential measurements showed a region of dispersion stability at a pH from 6 to 11 for lignosulfonate and sulfonic acid-based dispersants. Zeta potential and particle settling tests indicated that dispersion with sulfonic based copolymer is more effective than that of benzene sulfonic acid. Zeta potential values increased with temperature in sulfonic acid-based dispersant (i.e., 77 and 120°F). Zeta potential and transparency experiments showed that the optimum dispersant concentration was below 1 wt% and nearly 0.5 wt%. TGA analysis showed that the acrylates- and lignosulfonate-based dispersants were thermally stable between 300 and 500°F. SEM images of filter cake showed that aggregation of particles was reduced when acrylic based dispersant was used in clay contaminated drilling fluid. In most cases, the rheological behavior (i.e, shear stresses and viscosities) of clay contaminated and non-contaminated drilling fluids (17.5 and 20 lbm/gal) before/after heat aging at 400°F was lower in the presence of dispersants. Dispersant solutions with NaCl had varying compatibilities and particle settling interactions. The settling times of manganese tetroxide particles were lower, higher, or did not change for several dispersant solutions at 5 and 10 wt% NaCl. The sagging tendency of clay contaminated and non-contaminated drilling fluids was improved in the presence of dispersants. For instance, the sag factor was reduced from 0.55 to 0.51 in clay and rock salt contaminated drilling fluids when acrylic based copolymer was used. "

The production from the fields under study is pressure-maintained by peripheral water injection. More than 190 case studies were examined to generate populated trends and draw relevant conclusions on parameters affecting injection performances. Petroleum engineering concepts/tools, such as pressure transient analysis, were heavily used in this work to establish the effective yearly injection decline rate for each well. Extensive and dedicated sampling of injected water was carried out as part of water quality monitoring to ensure that well plugging and internal corrosion was minimized. The total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, particle count and size distribution, acidity, iron count, sulfide content, and bacterial growth data were measured and synchronized with the respective wells' injectivity indices to identify potential sources of well injection impairments. Major events, such as when starting or switching the water injection system, were thoroughly factored into the water quality analysis and its subsequent effect on the injection performances. The well injection performance analysis was carried out using pressure-transient analysis data obtained from Fall-Off Test (FOT) surveys, where each well has a baseline II survey taken when the well was first drilled and completed. Dimensionless injectivity indices were defined to compute the injection potential of each well. Baseline surveys were then compared with the subsequent or the latest surveys, if any, based on which time-lapse measurement trends were generated and analyzed. Several key findings and recommendations, regarding setting appropriate limits to water quality parameters and injection surveillance strategy, are presented in light of the performed analysis. This paper also discusses production engineering efforts to mitigate the decline in well injectivity, including: water quality control, well stimulation initiatives to enhance injectivity, and analysis of well plugging characteristics/profiles and their relation to reservoir permeability.

Good quality mudcakes can prevent such damage. This research focuses on the lab techniques and performance results of testing innovative water-based drilling fluids containing nanoparticles (NPs) for minimizing formation damage at high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) conditions. A couette type viscometer was used to examine the rheological properties of the drilling fluids tested in this research. Zeta potential measurements were conducted at different temperatures and concentrations to assess their stability and to investigate the role of charge potential. Indiana limestone outcrops were examined as the filter media for both static and dynamic filtration (up to 350°F and 500 psi) using a HP/HT dynamic filter press. The mudcakes were investigated using a computed-tomography (CT) scan, and Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to measure the concentrations of key ions in the filtrate fluids. A significant reduction in the filtrate fluid volume was achieved when using ferric oxide NPs (-43% for 0.5 wt%) compared to that of the base fluid. However, adding silica NPs led to an increase in the filtrate volume and mudcake thickness. Increasing the NP concentration resulted in an increase in the fluid loss and mudcake thickness. The mudcakes consisted of two layers, as indicated by the CT scan analysis. 0.5 wt% was found to be the optimal NP concentration, which provides less agglomeration and a reduction in the mudcake permeability by -76.4%. At this concentration, the ICP-OES analysis showed a higher cation dissociation, which promoted the formation of a different clay platelet microstructure. At a higher NP concentration, a new layer of NPs was formed in the mudcake, which adversely affects the mudcake characteristics, as demonstrated by CT scan analysis and SEM-EDS elemental mapping. The rheological measurements indicated a good rheology at different temperatures and NP concentrations. Moreover, the NPs helped to stabilize the viscosity and yield stress at high temperatures (up to 200°F). Aging at 350°F for 16 hours showed that NP-based drilling fluids remain stable with minor changes in rheological properties. The obtained rheological data for various NPs is fitted to the classical drilling fluid rheological models to determine the best fit-model, which can then be applied to an efficient design. This research provides a comprehensive evaluation of improved water-based drilling fluids, using ferric oxide and silica NPs for HP/HT applications. The examined NPs have the potential to enhance drilling fluid properties, which provides more efficient drilling operations and less formation damage. "

They are also used as standalone stimulation fluids and as iron-control agents during acidizing treatments. The main chelating agents used in the oil field include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), N-(hydroxyethyl)-ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), and glutamic acid diacetic acid (GLDA). (Note that the abbreviations for these chelating agents will be used throughout the rest of the paper.) One of the concerns with these chelants is their thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Chelant solutions (0.7 to 0.8 M) of HEDTA, GLDA, NTA, EDTA, and their mono-/disalts were prepared. The aqueous solutions of these chelants were heated at various temperatures (300 to 400°F) and times (2 to 12 hours). The concentration of chelant was measured with a titration method that uses FeCl3 solutions. The products of thermal decomposition of chelants were determined with mass spectrometry (MS) and gas-chromatography/MS techniques. Most chelants decomposed at temperatures greater than 350°F. At 400°F and after 12 hours of heating, diammonium salt of GLDA degraded more quickly than diammonium salt of EDTA chelant. Analyses of NH4H3GLDA with MS techniques after heating highlighted that the decomposition products included iminodiacetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, and α-hydroxyglutaric acid. Studying the kinetics of aqueous solutions of NaH3GLDA, NaH2HEDTA, and (NH4)2H2EDTA showed that their thermal-degradation kinetics followed a pseudofirst-order reaction. The Arrhenius equation can be used to predict the activation energy that is necessary for the degradation mechanisms of chelants. "

                    "abstract": "Viscoelastic-surfactant (VES) -based acid systems have been used successfully in matrix-acidizing and acid-fracturing treatments. However, the existence of Fe(III) as a contaminant in such systems may lead to many problems because of the interactions between VES and Fe(III). Such interactions can reduce the effectiveness of VES-based acid systems and potentially lead to formation damage. In this study, two commercial VES products were used and the interactions between VES and Fe(III) were studied. Rheological properties of these two VES-based acids were examined with various concentrations of Fe(III). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to identify precipitates from the reaction products. Inductively coupled plasma was applied to measure iron concentrations, and the two-phase titration method was used to determine the VES concentrations in all liquid phases of the samples. The effect of several chelating agents on the reaction of VES with Fe(III) was also examined. Experimental results indicate that the apparent viscosity of live VES-1-based acids [20 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl) and 4 vol% VES-1] increased from approximately 2 to 126 cp at a shear rate of 100 s–1 at room temperature when the Fe(III) concentration increased from 0 to 1,400 ppm, and it started to decrease at higher Fe(III) concentrations. This is because of the electrostatic interactions between negatively charged [FeCl4]– groups and positively charged amine groups in VES in live acids. Live VES-2-based acids (20 wt% HCl and 4 vol% VES-2) showed properties similar to those of the VES-1-based acids in apparent viscosity. Both surfactants interacted with Fe(III) and precipitates, which are complexes containing iron and VES. These interactions were noted at Fe(III) concentrations greater than 5,000 ppm. On the other hand, the addition of a chelating agent [1:1 mole ratio to Fe[III)] helped to reduce the apparent viscosity of the sample, which means that the chelating agent reacted with Fe(III) and reduced the interactions between VES and Fe(III). At the same time, when the Fe(III) concentration was 6,000 ppm in VES-2-based acid, the disappearance of precipitates with the addition of chelating agents showed a reduction of the Fe(III) impact on such VES-based acid systems. Moreover, the addition of enough chelating agent [more than 1:1 mole ratio to Fe(III) amount] reduced the amount of precipitates that formed significantly when the Fe(III) concentration was very high. Adding a suitable chelating agent can minimize the impact of Fe(III) on VES-based acids. "

                    "abstract": "Regular mud acid, which is composed of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydrofluoric (HF) acid, has been extensively used to remove formation damage in sandstone reservoirs; however, many problems may occur during stimulation treatments with this acid. To overcome many of these challenges, a phosphonic-based HF acid system has been used as an alternative to mud acid. However, very-limited research has been performed to investigate the interactions of phosphonic-based HF acid with clay minerals in sandstone reservoirs. In this study, a phosphonic-based HF acid system with two HF concentrations (1.5 and 3 wt%) was used to evaluate the solubility of various clay minerals (kaolinite, bentonite, chlorite, and illite) as a function of time and temperature. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to identify the reaction products. The pH of the solutions was measured by use of an HF-resistant electrode. The concentrations of key cations in the supernatant were analyzed by use of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The 19F, 31P, and 27Al liquid nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments were used for the first time to evaluate the reaction of this specific phosphonic-based acid with clay minerals. Coreflood experiments on Berea sandstone cores were conducted at 300°F and flow rate of 2 cm3/min by use of full-strength phosphonic-based HF acid (3 wt% of HF) and mud acid (12 wt% of HCl and 3 wt% of HF). No aluminum fluoride (AlF3) precipitate was identified by EDS and X-ray-diffraction analyses of the solid samples after kaolinite, bentonite, and illite reacted with full-strength phosphonic-based HF acid. Large amounts of AlF3 were noticed in the chlorite samples after being treated with a full-strength phosphonic-based HF acid. The concentration of soluble silicon decreases in the spent acid after full-strength phosphonic-based HF acid reacted with clay minerals at 302°F. This indicated a secondary reaction that occurred at high temperatures, decreasing the ratio of silicon/aluminum. This result was further confirmed by the 19F NMR results at high temperature. The 19F NMR results obtained after the high-temperature reaction showed that HF acid in the full-strength phosphonic-based-HF acid solution was completely consumed in 30 minutes when it reacted with clay minerals at a weight ratio of 10:1 at 302°F. Coreflood tests showed significant permeability improvement to Berea sandstone when using full-strength phosphonic-based HF acid compared with regular mud acid. "

                    "title": "A Novel Pore-Scale Thermal-Fracture-Acidizing Model With Heterogeneous Rock Properties",
                    "abstract": "Fracture acidizing is a well-stimulation technique used to improve the productivity of low-permeability reservoirs and to bypass deep formation damage. The reaction of injected acid with the rock matrix forms etched channels through which oil and gas can then flow upon production. The properties of these etched channels depend on the acid-injection rate, temperature, reaction chemistry, mass-transport properties, and formation mineralogy. As the acid enters the formation, it increases in temperature by heat exchange with the formation and the heat generated by acid reaction with the rock. Thus, the reaction rate, viscosity, and mass transfer of acid inside the fracture also increase. In this study, a new thermal-fracture-acidizing model is presented that uses the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate reactive transport. This method incorporates both accurate hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics at the solid/liquid interface. The temperature update is performed by use of a finite-difference technique. Furthermore, heterogeneity in rock properties (e.g., porosity, permeability, and reaction rate) is included. The result is a model that can accurately simulate realistic fracture geometries and rock properties at the pore scale and that can predict the geometry of the fracture after acidizing. Three thermal-fracture-acidizing simulations are presented here, involving injection of 15 and 28 wt% of hydrochloric acid into a calcite fracture. The results clearly show an increase in the overall fracture dissolution because of the addition of temperature effects (increasing the acid-reaction and mass-transfer rates). It has also been found that by introducing mineral heterogeneity, preferential dissolution leads to the creation of uneven etching across the surfaces, indicating channel formation. "

                    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major greenhouse gas emitted in all activities. CO2 sequestration in coal seams has become an attractive carbon sequestration technology where the injection of CO2 enhances methane production from coalbeds (ECBM), in addition to storing CO2. CO2 can be retained in coal via three ways: free gas within the pore space or fractures in the coal, adsorbed molecules on the organic surface of coal, and dissolved in groundwater within the coal. This study investigates the effects of the salinity (NaCl) of coal seam water, injection flow rate, and CO2 state (formation pressure) on the CO2 sequestration in volatile bitumen coal. To achieve this objective; coreflood tests were conducted on different coal cores. The change in the effective water-coal permeability after CO2 injection was examined. Also, the displacement efficiency of water by CO2 was estimated. The experimental data was cross-matched with numerical simulation to estimate the relative permeability curves. The coreflood experiments showed that the effective water permeability in coal decreased during CO2 injection due to its adsorption onto the coal surface, and reduction of the relative water permeability. Higher formation pressure led to permeability reduction as a result of higher CO2 adsorption onto the coal surface. The effective water permeability decreased by 8% at 50 psi back pressure, compared to 48% at 1100 psi back pressure. Furthermore, as the injection flow rate increased, the contact time of CO2 to the coal surface decreased. Hence, the CO2 adsorption to the coal matrix decreased and the change on effective water permeability slightly decreased. Specifically, the effective water permeability decreased by 48% at 1 cm3/min comparing to 41% at 4 cm3/min. As salt concentration increased, the change in pressure drop across the core slightly increased, but this effect decreased as formation pressure increased. As the water salinity increased, the coal become more CO2 wet, and the residual gas saturation increased. Based on these observations, the injection of CO2 into highly volatile bitumen coal seams for CO2 sequestration and ECBM purposes is more efficient as the salt concentration increases and high injection pressure.

                    "abstract": "Access to deeper oil and gas reservoirs in hostile environments necessitates improvement of existing drilling fluids. This work focuses on the lab techniques for developing, assessing and analyzing innovative water-based drilling fluids containing iron oxide (Fe2O3) and silica nanoparticles (SiO2). The fluid loss characteristics were examined both in an American Petroleum Institute (API) static filter press and in a High Temperature-High Pressure (HTHP) filter press under elevated pressures and temperatures (300 psi/250°F). A computed-tomography (CT) scan was used for deep analysis of the filter cake. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the morphology of the filter cake as well as to give deep insights for their microstructure, the interfacial phenomena and the interaction between bentonite particles and the nanoparticles. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry was used to determine the quality of the produced filtrate. Zeta potential measurements were used to assess the stability of the developed suspensions. The changes in the rheological properties of the nanofluids were measured at HT conditions using a standard Fann type viscometer. Significant modifications have been observed with the addition of nanoparticles to the base fluid of water-bentonite suspension in rheological and filtration characteristics. The rheological analysis showed an increase of the yield stress and of the gel strength as the concentration of nanoparticles was increased. Both the API static and the HTHP filter press indicated a remarkable improvement in the fluid loss and filter cake characteristics for the samples containing iron oxide nanoparticles. For samples containing silica nanopowder, there was an adverse effect on the fluid loss characteristics with minor changes in the rheological profile. The filtration efficiency was reduced with the increase of the concentration of Fe2O3 nanoparticles which was confirmed by CT scan measurements. Results revealed that 0.5% (w/w) is the optimal concentration for the Fe2O3 nanoparticles, above which they form a new layer in the filter cake that adversely affected the fluid loss and filter cake characteristics. SEM and ICP measurements confirmed this phenomenon and revealed the agglomeration effect and the smooth surface of the produced filter cakes. Zeta potential measurements at different concentrations and temperatures of the produced nanofluids showed that the iron oxide nanoparticles were stable in colloidal suspensions, whereas silica nanopowder was unstable under different temperatures. The examined nanoparticles have the potential to significantly improve the characteristics of the filter cakes at both low temperature-low pressure (LTLP) and HTHP conditions. They also have the ability to maintain optimal rheological properties so that many drilling problems can be efficiently mitigated. Their low concentration in the drilling system, compared to other conventional drilling additives, provides a basis for more efficient drilling practices. "

                    "abstract": "Restoring formation damage by matrix acidizing is one of the common ways to increase productivity in sandstone formations. While sandstone formations are typically composed of the same types of minerals, the concentration and composition of these minerals, as well as the permeability and porosity of the matrix, can vary widely. Such variable petrophysical and compositional properties of sandstone formations can affect the severity of fines migration and the performance of acid stimulation treatments. To evaluate the effect of acid stimulation on petrophysical properties before and after fines migration, coreflood experiments were conducted on Bandera sandstone cores. Half of the treatments were conducted on cores that were damaged by triggering fines migration by injecting deionized water, and the other half were conducted on undamaged cores. These cores contain a wide range of clay content, mineral compositions, permeability, pore size distribution, and porosity. A series of characterizing tests and measurements were performed before and after acid treatments. The objectives of this work include: (a) analyzing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements to determine the mineralogy and elemental composition of the rocks, (b) interpreting computational tomography (CT) scans to evaluate pore-scale heterogeneity and acid effect on cementing material, and (c) evaluating permeability by flooding the core samples with brine. More than 20 coreflood experiments were conducted at constant temperatures of 72, 150, and 250°F and constant acid concentration on 6 in. x 1.5 in. core samples at different injection rates. The CT- scans proved, quantified, and localized the fines migration in the damaged cores. The effect of fines migration on the acid stimulation treatment success in terms of increasing permeability and ultimately productivity was determined. Additionally, acid reaction increases porosity and permeability. However, treatment of damaged cores yielded different pore-size distribution and permeability compared to undamaged cores. Furthermore, combining CT-scan and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results proved an extremely high sensitivity of fines migration toward HCl at temperatures 150 and 250°F resulted in porosity deterioration toward the outlet compared to the gained porosity at the inlet of the treated cores. The literature is rich with discussions about sandstone acidizing and acid systems. However, this comparative study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of fines migration on the success of the stimulation treatment and its effect on petrophysical properties. The outcome of this work will lead to a reliable design of matrix acid treatments and, hence, increase the chances of successful acid stimulation treatment that optimizes well productivity. "

                    "abstract": "Carbonate formations are very complex in their pore structure and exhibit a wide variety of pore classes, such as interparticle porosity, moldic porosity, vuggy porosity, and microporosity. Geologists have defined carbonate pore classes on the basis of sedimentology, thin sections, and porosity/permeability relationships, but the question remains concerning how these pore classes govern the acid flow through porous media. Core samples from six different carbonates, mainly limestone, were selected for the study. The samples were first investigated with thin-section analysis, high-pressure mercury-injection tests, and nuclear-magnetic-resonance measurements for pore-structure characterization, and X-ray diffraction for mineralogy examination. Next, tracer experiments were conducted, and the tracer-concentration profiles were analyzed to quantify the carbonate pore-scale heterogeneity. The heterogeneity is expressed with a parameter f—the available fraction of pore structure contributing to the flow. The data were used to study the flow of acid through carbonate rocks and correlate the pore classes to the acid response. More than 30 acid-coreflood experiments were conducted at 150°F and hydrochloric acid concentration of 15 wt% on 1.5 x 6-in. core samples at different injection rates on each carbonate rock type. The objective of these sets of experiments is to determine the acid pore volume to breakthrough for each carbonate pore class. The findings of this study help us to connect the results from different characterization methods to the acid flow through the porous media of carbonate rocks. It was also found that the response of the acid depends on the carbonate pore classes. Application to the design of matrix acid treatments in carbonate rocks is discussed. "

                    "abstract": "The in-situ combustion (ISC) is highly effective thermal enhanced oil recovery process in which high displacement efficiencies can be accomplished. While several physical and chemical factors affect the ISC performance, there is a little knowledge about how each parameter changes the ISC fate. In this study, we investigate the catalytic effect of clay on different crude oil types. Six one-dimensional combustion tube experiments were conducted on three different crude oil samples; one from Mexico and two from Alberta, Canada. The combustion behavior of each crude oil sample was tested with two combustion runs; by preparing reservoir rock with only sand (E1, E3, and E5) and by preparing reservoir rock with 3 wt% clay and 97 wt% sand mixture (E2, E4, E6). The combustion characteristics were monitored with temperature profiles, produced gas compositions, and produced liquid yields. The level of in-situ oil upgrading were determined by comparing the viscosities of produced oil samples with the original ones. The results showed that the catalytic effect of the clay controls the combustion front propagation, the fuel formation, and the produced oil quality. Clays visualized on postmortem samples in the shape of lumps indicate that clay alteration occured at elevated temperature due to interaction of clay with crude oil and due to thermal decomposition of clay. It was observed that the lump formation was associated with mainly saturates and asphaltene contents of initial oil and asphaltene-clay interaction during fuel formation. Our results support that the clay presence in reservoir rock had an impact on ISC performance. However, this impact did not have a linear trend and the response of the catalytic effect of clays were different from one crude oil to another; while one crude oil favored combustion more with the presence of clay, the other did not and led to lower oil production by producing more gas.

                    "abstract": "The flocculation of aqueous-based drilling fluid, particularly at high temperature or in a high-salinity environment, is a common problem. The aggregation and settling of solid particles (e.g. manganese tetraoxide) causes operational problems, such as stuck pipe, well control, false bit gain, and scale problems. The flocculation of manganese tetraoxide particles becomes more severe at high density with the presence of clays such as bentonite and common fluid contaminants, such as cement and divalent salts. This affects the rheological behavior and sagging tendency of the drilling fluid adversely. Dispersants called deflocculants, thinner or dispersing agents, are used in drilling fluids to prevent solid flocculation. To minimize such flocculation problems, a thorough study was undertaken to identify aggregation of Mn3O4 particles and appropriate dispersants for water–based fluids weighted with Mn3O4. The dispersion of Mn3O4 particles in aqueous solutions was evaluated through visual transparency testing and a PC-2200 Spectrek laser particle analyzer. A Mastersizer 2000 was used to obtain the particle size distribution and specific surface area of Mn3O4 particles. A TGA was used to assess the thermal stability. The compatibility of over 50 dispersants with aqueous solutions was examined using a variable speed mixer. Viscosity and sagging tendency were evaluated using a Fan 35A viscometer and density variation measurements. The effect of CaCl2 was considered in the experimental study. The drilling fluids were aged using a hot rolling oven up to 400°F. Linear and other structures of particle aggregations were identified in Mn3O4-based filter cake. Dispersants examined were categorized into groups A, B, and C. Groups A and B dispersants showed settling times of 24 hours and 1–3 hours, respectively. More than 25 dispersants were assigned to groups A and B. Laser particle analysis showed that aggregation of particles was reduced in the presence of a lignosulfonate-based dispersant. Lignosulfonate and acrylate-based dispersants were compatible with water-based fluids and thermally stable up to 400°F and in the presence of CaCl2. Both dispersants reduced the sag factor and fluid loss for the drilling fluids in the presence of cement contamination. The shear stress/rate relationship and viscosity measurements showed that the rheological behavior of drilling fluids dispersed with either dispersants was improved. The dispersants chosen were non-toxic to aquatic organisms and biodegradable. The examined drilling fluids were high-density fluids up to 20 lbm/gal appropriate for deep drilling. "

                    "abstract": "Acid stimulation of horizontal wellbores in high temperature and/or low permeability formations is complicated due to the need to balance acid reaction rates with the rate of formation penetration. At high bottom hole temperatures, uncontrolled acid spending rates result in inefficient or even damaging treatments. It is advantageous to add materials which slow the reaction of HCl or use alternative acids which are useful as alternative stimulation fluids, such as organic acids and chelants due to their inherently lower reaction rates. The slower reaction rate with carbonate minerals allows for optimal wormhole growth at the limited rates available in long horizontals. This study investigates the complementary use of acid or chelant systems together with a microemulsion delivery system to achieve the desired performance. These delivery systems can significantly increase the efficiency of HCl and chelant stimulation treatments of low-permeability carbonates by optimizing diffusivity and minimizing pressure to cleanup. Horizontal core flow experiments were conducted by injecting solutions of 15 wt% HCl and 10–20 wt% alternative acids through low permeability (< 10 md) limestone cores. High permeability cores were also investigated by injecting 15 wt% HCl through high permeability (150–200 md) Indiana limestone cores. These experiments were conducted with and without the addition of a microemulsion additive and at core injection rates from 0.2 – 20 cm3/min corresponding to 0.25 to 5 BPM per 100 ft of a horizontal wellbore. Significant performance advantages were found with the addition of the microemulsion delivery system. The treatment volume required for wormholes to propagate the length of the test core was reduced at all flow rates at or above the optimum rate. Core penetration was more efficient when using the microemulsion, without an increase in pumping pressure. Initiation and extension of wormholes was improved, as compared to the experiments without the microemulsion, in which more conical wormholes tended to form at the inlet face. The reduction in treatment volume necessary to reach breakthrough with the microemulsion present also suggested a more efficient treatment. The complementary use of a microemulsion delivery system with acids and chelants has been shown to enhance acid stimulation treatment potential in long horizontal wellbores with high temperature or low permeability formations. This system can be used to optimize wormhole penetration while maintaining an optimum injection rate across long horizontal intervals where the maximum achievable injection rate is relatively low. "

                    "abstract": "Polymer crosslinked solutions support many beneficial applications in the oil industry, such as water shutoff and hydraulic fracturing. These techniques pose challenges, and, in order to reach a favorable result, high quality gels are required. This study investigates the effectiveness of four zirconium-based, one aluminum-based, and one aluminum-zirconium-based crosslinkers that can be functional over a wide pH range (3.8 to 10) in crosslinking CMHPG (Carboxymethylhydroxypropylguar). Zirconium chemistry in aqueous solutions is quite complicated. Zirconium is prone to hydrolysis and readily polymerizes. It is highly sensitive to pH, temperature, and ionic strength. A high viscosity gel is a function of and a combination of the correct selection of crosslinkers, buffer systems, pH, polymer loadings, crosslinker concentrations, and temperatures. Not only do the type of ligands attached to the zirconium impact gel performance, but also the order of addition and reaction temperatures. Thus, two very similar crosslinkers can display very different performances. This research further investigates the effects on gel formation of specific crosslinker concentrations (0.7 to 1.3 gpt) in a pH environment of 3.8 to 10.8. After forming a gel, the impacts of temperatures at 60 to 121°C (140 to 250°F) and the varying shear rates on the viscosity of formed gels were tested. The viscosity of crosslinked CMHPG using the crosslinker at a low pH (3.8) remained above 1,000 cp after 60 minutes at 60°C (140°F) and 10 s-1. Increasing the shear rate to 170 s-1 caused the viscosity to decrease to 300 cp. However, the viscosity stabilized at 300 cp for almost 40 minutes. At a low pH (3.8), delay curves were developed for the gelling process. The fast crosslinking reaction has always been a limitation of crosslinkers at high pH; however, the new aluminum-zirconium dual crosslinker in this study overcame this shortcoming. The optimum crosslinked gel was tested for proppant-carrying purposes along with the static leakoff tests. The results also revealed gel proppant-suspending capabilities and acceptable leakoff rates. Extensive lab research undergirds a successful field treatment, and these results indicate that a high viscosity at high shear rates cannot be used to interpret the particle settling properties of a crosslinked gel. In addition, the chemistry of crosslinkers is very important as this study reveals that a viscosity buildup delay at a high pH, which has always been a shortcoming, is possible through the right choice of crosslinkers.

                    "abstract": "In the recent past, IOR/EOR technologies have been modified to include the effects of salinity of injected brine on oil recovery. Water Alternating Gas (WAG) is one such tertiary oil recovery process in the field. It greatly improves the synergy of various individual mechanisms underlining EOR processes, such as ion exchange, wettability alteration, and mobility control. This process has matured over the years, but the alteration of the salinity of injected brine during WAG has not been experimented extensively. This paper investigates the effect of injected brine salinity during water-alternating-CO2 injection and compares its performance with standalone brine injection, using 20 in. length outcrop Grey Berea sandstone cores. The water alternating CO2 process was done under immiscible conditions. It also studies the effect of aging on the oil recovery during waterflooding process. In the present work, six coreflood experiments were performed: four experiments before aging the cores and two experiments after aging the cores. All of the experiments were done at 149°F. The evaluation of oil recovery and pressure drop were done for each coreflood. The effect of salinity on the rock wettability during waterflooding and water alternating CO2 processes was studied using axisymmetric contact angle measurements. The effect of salinity on the waterflooding process as well as water alternating CO2 injection process was observed through the coreflood experiments. Low-salinity brine gave the highest recovery during the waterflooding process in aged cores, and seawater brine gave the highest recovery during water alternating CO2 injection process. Wettability alteration towards a more water-wet state was the cause of improved oil recovery by low-salinity brine during the waterflooding process. The lower solubility of CO2 in seawater brine compared to the solubility of CO2 in low-salinity brine was the reason for the higher oil recovery by seawater brine during water alternating CO2 injection process. Fines migration was observed during low-salinity brine alternating CO2 injection process. Aging played an important role in the recovery of oil during the waterflooding process. There was greater oil recovery in aged cores compared to unaged cores. The salinity of brine affected the contact angle measurements of the Grey Berea sandstone rock. The rock was strongly water-wet in the presence of low-salinity brine. Seawater brine made the rock more oil-wet due to the ion binding nature of the divalent ions in seawater brine. The aging of the cores increased the contact angle of the rock, thereby making the rock more oil-wet. "

It has been established that as the pH of the injected acid increases, iron (III) ions start to precipitate and block the pores. However, where exactly this iron precipitates and how iron precipitation changes with different lithologies has not yet been studied. Coreflood experiments were conducted to assess the effects of temperature and iron concentrations on the degree of damage caused by iron precipitation during an acid job. The temperature values tested were 200 and 300°F. Iron concentrations ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 ppm was used. The core effluent samples were analyzed by ICP to measure the concentrations of key cations. After conducting core flood experiments, it was found that iron precipitation occurs across the entire core. Iron precipitation was severely detrimental in the sandstone cores compared to those of calcite and dolomite. While the limestone cores showed the least formation damage from iron precipitation, core flood tests indicated that as the iron concentration increases, the damage was more evident, especially in the sandstone cores. On the other hand, increasing the temperature adversely affected sandstone and dolomite cores but improved the final permeability of limestone cores. In this study, the location of the iron precipitation is determined for three different lithologies. The effects of different parameters are studied to determine the best conditions that would lead to a decrease in iron precipitation and hence prevent formation damage. Iron control agents are not always needed, as previously thought. "

CO2 sequestration in coal enhances methane production from the coalbed (ECBM) in addition to storing CO2. CO2 can be stored in coalbeds in three ways: free gas within the pore space or fractures in the coal, adsorbed on the organic surface of the coal, or dissolved in the groundwater within the coal. This paper addresses the effect of the salinity of the coal seam water, injected gas composition, and formation pressure on the CO2 sequestration in volatile bitumen coal. In order to achieve these objectives, coreflood tests were conducted using coal cores. The displacement efficiency of water by CO2 and the effective water permeability change due to CO2 adsorption were measured. The coreflood experiments showed that the permeability reduction due to coal swelling was significant in the case of high NaCl concentrations. The permeability reduction changed from 22 to 32% with the salinity increasing from DI to 20 g/L NaCl. The displacement efficiency increased as the salinity increased. The water saturation after CO2 injection decreased from 37 to 25% with salinity increasing from DI to 20 g/L NaCl. Also, as N2 concentration increased in the injection gas, the permeability reduction and the sweep efficiency decreased. In the case of DI water and 50% N2, the permeability reduction was 12%, and the residual water saturation was 47%. Based on these observations, CO2 sequestration and ECBM into highly volatile bitumen coal seams with high salt concentration is more efficient compared to low salt concentration. "

                    "title": "A New Technique to Increase the Performance of Organic Acids to Stimulate Carbonate Reservoirs at High Acid Concentrations",
                    "abstract": "Organic acids have been used to stimulate HP/HT oil and gas wells. However, these acids cannot be used above certain concentrations, which depend on the type of acid used. For example, 9 wt% is the upper limit for formic acid concentration, whereas acetic and citric acids can be used only up to 13 and 1 wt%, respectively. Using these acids above these limits causes a formation damage results from the precipitation of the acids' calcium salts. A new technique was developed and experimentally proven to increase the concentration of organic acids that can be used in the oilfield without precipitation of the reaction products. This involves the addition of an environmentally friendly acid (gluconic acid) chelant to the selected organic acid under investigation. In a recently published paper (SPE-173751), the authors showed a significant improvement in the solubility of calcium lactate when lactic acid was mixed with gluconic acid to stimulated calcite rocks. The current work investigates the generalization of this idea for other organic acids such as: acetic, formic, citric, glycolic, and boric acids, with an objective to examine the effectiveness of the new acids to stimulate carbonate formation at 150-250°F and determine the optimum injection requirements. Coreflood results showed that mixing gluconic acid with acetic acid increased the solubility of the resulted calcium salt and allowed using acetic acid at 15 wt% without the risk of precipitating calcium acetate. When mixed with formic acid, a minimum of acid pore volume was observed at a gluconic: formic acids molar ratio of 1:7. This allowed the use of formic acid at 12.5 wt% without any observation of calcium formate precipitation. Gluconic-citric and gluconic-boric acid mixtures required as high as 4 PV to breakthrough, indicating that the enhancement of product solubility depends on the type of the acid mixed with gluconic acid. Finally, a gluconic-glycolic acid mixture with a molar ratio of 1:1 showed the least acid pore volume required to breakthrough (2.35 PV) with similar results to what was previously reported for gluconic-lactic acid mixtures.

                    "abstract": "Proppants are required in hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industry. They consist of solid particles with specific strengths and are used to keep the rock fractures open in order to increase well production. They can be naturally occurring sand grains or artificial ceramic materials. Studying the acid resistance of proppants is important. Acids are needed to remove the scale and clays that affect the fracture conductivity. This study investigated the different factors affecting the interactions between mud acid and sand proppants. Several experiments were conducted using the aging cell with mud acid (3 wt% HF, 12 wt% HCl) up to 300°F. The effects of temperature, soaking time, and static and dynamic conditions were examined. The supernatant of solubility tests was analyzed to measure total silicon concentrations using ICP-ES. The proppant was sieved before and after the experiments. Following that, the residual solids were dried and analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results showed that sand proppant is soluble in regular mud acid, nearly 10 wt% dissolved in some cases. The amount of proppant dissolved increased with temperature, soaking time, concentration, and dynamic conditions. The fines generated and the changes in grain size distribution are detrimental to the proppant conductivity. This work will help to achieve a better acid treatment design when sand proppant is used.

                    "abstract": "The objective of matrix acidizing treatments is to remove the skin damage from the vicinity around the wellbore and enhance the permeability and the well productivity. While this is accomplished in sandstone by using reactive fluids to dissolve the clay and the surrounding cementing materials, carbonate stimulation is successful when the reactive fluids bypass the damage by creating conductive channels or \"wormholes\". It is rare in both treatments that the acids are used alone without several additives. The presence of any of these additives, which is required to achieve a certain function, may impact significantly the outcome of the acid treatment either positively or negatively. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of the type and concentration of several additives, which are currently in-use in the oilfield, on the calcite dissolution rate with HCl using the rotating disk reactor. Additives such as corrosion inhibitors, synthetic polymers, mono and divalent chloride salts, mutual solvent, dissolved iron, viscoelastic surfactants, and chelating agents were investigated. The results showed that more reliable data was obtained at lower acid concentrations. Higher acid concentrations were associated with significant surface changes and inevitable source of error. The effect of corrosions inhibitors was studied by investigating three corrosion inhibitors (CI-A, CI-B, and CI-C) obtained from three different service companies. The presence of two corrosions inhibitors was associated with a reduction in the dissolution rate (between 7 and 45%), while the presence of the third one (containing formic acid) increased the rate of dissolution up to 38%. The effect of all other additives was further examined in the presence of one of the corrosion inhibitors. The presence of a synthetic polyacrylamide polymer significantly reduced the reaction rate down to 96% compared to a blank acid solution that did not contain the polymer. Monovalent ions (sodium and potassium) showed little effect on the calcite dissolution rate, the presence of divalent ions such as magnesium chloride was associated with a reduction in the rate. Calcium chloride showed an increase in the reaction rate for both cases of the presence and the absence of a corrosion inhibitor. The results also showed that mutual solvent changed the dissolution rate and a minimum was observed at 5 vol%. These results were confirmed by changing the corrosion inhibitor and the same behavior was observed at the same mutual solvent concentration. Dissolved iron reduced the rate of reaction by 17% at iron concentration up to 5000 mg/l. At 17,000 mg/l, the rate was reduced by 39% and a reddish to brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide was observed on the rock samples after the reaction, indicating a ferric precipitate. The reaction of VES-based acid showed a minimum at 125°F, which matched the maximum viscosity at low shear rate. The presence of 5 wt% chelating agents increased the reaction rate of 0.1 N HCl by 12.7 and 25%, when the reactions were conducted with no corrosion inhibitors and with 1 vol% CI-A, respectively. Additives change the reaction of HCl with calcite, and these changes should be considered when the acids are used in matrix acidizing or acid fracturing. "

The objective of this study is to assess the efficiency of hydrochloric acid to remove ilmenite oil-based filter cake, and therefore remediate any damage that might occur during its use in drilling operations. An oil-based drilling fluid containing micronized ilmenite with 1.9 S.G. was used for filter cake formation. A HP/HT filter press was used for the removal process of ilmenite oil-based filter cake. Prior the acid removal, a mutual solvent (10 vol%) was used to break the oil-based filter cake for 2 hours. The purpose of the use of a mutual solvent is to remove the oil-soluble components and change the wettability of oil-based filter cake. Berea sandstone cores with an average porosity of 18 vol% and an average permeability of 50 md were used. CT scan, XRD, SEM, and chemical analysis were used to examine the reaction characteristics of different concentrations of acid with ilmenite oil-based filter cake. Coreflood tests with different concentrations of HCl were also conducted to provide recommendations on how to remove the internal damage caused by oil-based drilling fluid invasion during drilling operations. Results showed that ilmenite oil-based filter cake can be successfully removed at 300°F after soaking with 5 wt% hydrochloric acid for 4 hours, even without causing much damage to the core permeability. The filter press test showed that the retained permeability of Berea sandstone cores was more than 90%. In the core flood tests, with the increment of the HCl concentration from 5 to 15 wt%, more internal damage could be removed. There was even some stimulation effect with 15 wt% HCl. This study will provide a complete evaluation of the efficiency of hydrochloric acid in removing ilmenite oil-based filter cake for HP/HT applications. "

                    "abstract": "Acidizing sandstone formations is a real challenge for the oil and gas industry. Fines migration, sand production, and additional damages caused by precipitation are some of the common concerns related to sandstone treatments. Furthermore, the complexities of sandstone formations require a mixture of acids and loadings of several additives. The environmentally friendly chelating agent glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) was used successfully to stimulate deep gas wells in carbonate reservoirs. It was tested extensively in the laboratory to stimulate sandstone cores with various mineralogies. Significant permeability improvements were reported in previous papers over a wide range of conditions. In this paper, the result of the first field application is evaluated with a fluid based on this chelating agent to acidize an offshore, sour oil well in a sandstone reservoir. The field treatment included pumping a preflush of xylene to remove oil residues and any possible asphaltene deposited in the wellbore region, followed by the main stage that contained 25 wt% GLDA, a corrosion inhibitor, and a water-wetting surfactant. The treatment fluids were displaced into the formation by pumping diesel. The treatment fluids were allowed to soak for 6 hours, then the well was put into production, and samples of flowback fluids were collected. The concentrations of key cations were determined using inductively coupled plasma, and the chelant concentration was measured using a titration method with ferric chloride solutions. Corrosion tests conducted on low-carbon-steel tubulars indicated that this chelant has low corrosion rates under bottomhole conditions. No corrosion-inhibitor intensifier was needed. The treatment was applied in the field without encountering any operational problems. A significant gain in oil production was achieved without causing sand production, or fines migration. Analysis of flowback samples confirmed the ability of the chelating-agent solution to dissolve various types of carbonates, oxides, and sulphides, while keeping the dissolved species in solution without causing unwanted precipitation. Unlike previous treatments conducted on this well, where 15 wt% hydrochloric acid (HCl) or 13.5 wt%/1.5 wt% HCl/hydrofluoric acid (HF) acids were used, the concentrations of iron and manganese in the flowback samples were negligible, confirming the low corrosion rates of well tubulars when using GLDA solutions.

                    "abstract": "Coalbed methane (CBM) currently accounts for approximately 5% of U.S. annual gas production. The performance prediction of CBM is very complex. It is highly affected by the complexity of porosity–permeability variation, reduction due to formation compaction, enhancement due to matrix shrinkage, and the two-phase flow effects. An additional complexity is added if the initial gas content, permeability, and porosity are not available. In this paper an integrated model was developed to simulate the behavior of CBM. A developed generalized material balance equation is used to account for the solubility of the methane in water, and the changes of porosity and permeability with pressure depletion. The equation is formatted similarly to the conventional material balance of oil reservoirs. An optimization algorithm was also used with the integrated model. The model could be used as a history matching tool to estimate the original gas-in-place (the adsorbed gas-in-place and the free gas-in-place), the initial formation permeability, the gas and water relative permeability exponents, and the matrix shrinkage coefficient that reflected the permeability changes. The developed model was validated by use of different simulation cases generated with a commercial simulator. The results show a good match between the simulation cases and the integrated model. The model was then used to analyze the production data of different CBM formations (the Fruitland and the Upper Pottsville Formations, USA). The model was used to match the production history data (gas and water rates) in order to estimate the gas-in-place and the formation properties. These parameters were then used to predict the production performance. The model can be run with different production control conditions such as the constant water rate or the constant bottom-hole flowing pressure. This model could be used as a helpful tool in CBM investment and development. It can also be used to obtain the key reservoir parameters for newly discovered reservoirs such as gas-in-place, initial water-in-place, water production rate, gas production rate, and the peak gas rate. With this information, an investor will better determine the feasibility of a project. Also, this model can be used to optimize the dewatering rate (initial water production rate) in order to optimize the time taken to reach the peak gas rate. "

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is used extensively to develop oil and gas wells in both high and low-permeability formations. Biopolymer-based fluids, including guar or guar derivatives, constitute the majority of polymers in fracturing fluids. These polymers cause formation damage, which is a serious problem on production enhancement. Therefore, the search for an alternative to guar is meaningful to the oil industry. In this paper, a novel viscosifier (V1) was developed to prepare fracturing fluids. The rheological properties and proppant suspending ability of V1-based fluid have been studied with the effects of viscosifier concentration, temperature, and salts. Formation damage of the new type of hydraulic fracturing fluid in sandstone has been evaluated and compared to guar, hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), and viscoelastic surfactant (VES) fluids. The effects of temperature, viscosifier type, concentration, and formation permeability were investigated. The regained permeability of sandstone cores (expressed as a percentage of the initial permeability) was used to quantify the damage degree in coreflood tests. The viscosity measurements have shown that V1-based fluids were stable up to 350°F with a high tolerance to KCl and CaCl2. Moreover, V1-based fluids had a good proppant suspending ability at 75 and 250°F, which out-performanced guar-based fluids. Coreflood tests were run using Berea and Bandera sandstone cores. As for V1 fluids, the regained permeabilities of the cores were 88% or higher of the initial permeabilities, suggesting that V1 caused a slight damage. However, guar and HPG fluids caused much more damage than V1 fluids under same conditions. The effects of temperature, viscosifier concentration, and formation type were different for guar-based fluids from V1 fluids. The external filter cake was formed when the V1 fluid was injected; however, no external filter cake was found for guar, HPG, or VES. The filter cake could be removed by injecting 5 wt% KCl brine in the opposite direction. It was the first time to use this new cellulosic viscosifier in hydraulic fracturing fluids. The new type of fracturing fluid has better thermal stability and proppant suspending ability than guar-based fluids under the same conditions. Moreover, high regained permeability of sandstone cores can be maintained when treated by the new fracturing fluid. "

                    "abstract": "Capillary end effect develops in tight gas and shale formations near hydraulic fractures during flow back of the fracturing treatment water and extends into the natural gas production period. In this study, a new multi-phase reservoir flow simulation model is used to understand the role the capillary end effect plays on the removal of the water from the formation and on the gas production. The reservoir model has a matrix pore structure mainly consisting of a network of micro-fractures and cracks under stress. The model simulates water-gas flow in this network with a capillary discontinuity at the hydraulic fracture-matrix interface. The simulation results show that the capillary end effect cause significant formation damage during the flow back and production period by holding the water volume and saturation near the fracture at higher levels than that based on only the spontaneous imbibition of water. The effect makes water less mobile, or trapped, in the formation during the flow-back and tends to block gas flow during the production. The stress change effects during the production are relatively less important. We showed that the capillary end effect cannot be removed completely but can be reduced significantly by controlling the wellbore flowing pressure and by altering the formation wettability. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique for improved natural gas production from tight gas and shale formations. However, the implementation of the technique brings in new formation damage considerations. During the fracturing treatment, a large volume of water is pumped with proppants into the well. The injected water at high pressure applies the downhole force necessary for the fracture initiation and growth into the formation. Following the treatment, the well is flowed back. Only a small fraction of the injected water can be recovered, however, during the flow-back and natural gas production (Cheng, 2012). A large portion of the water is left behind in the fractures as residual water. Several studies argued that during the treatment forced imbibition of the fracturing water into the water-wet clayey portion of the formation as another reason for the fracturing fluid loss (Bennion and Thomas, 2005; Shaoul et al., 2011, Cheng, 2012; Eveline et al., 2017). The injected water lost to the formation creates a region of high water saturation which may lead to liquid blocking near the fracture during the gas production (Shaoul et al., 2011) and to clay swelling (Scott et al., 2007; Eveline et al., 2017). These studies have previously showed the potential flow impairment mechanisms in tight gas and shale formations and discussed to a certain extent that they may influence a well's performance during production. However, these studies did not consider the existence of capillary end effect (CEE). In ultra-low permeability formations, such as tight gas and shale, the sizes of the pores and cracks contributing to the transport of fluids are significantly reduced. Hence, once the fresh fracturing water invades, the formation experiences large gas-water capillary pressure. Consequently, the two-phase flow dynamics during the flow-back could be controlled by capillary forces. In the presence of strong capillarity, the capillary discontinuity at the fracture-matrix interface will retain the injected water within the formation. This retention could cause high levels of immobile water saturation near the fracture and significantly amplify the liquid blocking in the formation. "

                    "abstract": "Characterization studies of organic-rich shale oil reservoirs have revealed significant volumes of hydrocarbon fluids in kerogen. However, the recovery from kerogen pores is challenging due to amplified fluid-solid interactions. New methods can be developed for improved recovery targeting oil from kerogen pore space by modifying the forces of molecular interactions using chemical injection. A highly-developed kerogen pore-network is required for the penetration and delivery of chemical agents that are expected to function in the confined space, such surface active agents. Using advanced computational chemistry tools, the objective of this paper is to show that the maturation (the exposure to high temperature, high pressure) of kerogen during catagenesis relates to the quality of the kerogen pore network such as pore size and shape, and plays important role in the action of added chemicals in the EOR processes. A new molecular dynamics simulation approach is developed applying dramatic changes to the organic chemicals system temperature to mimic varying degree of maturation. Simulation focuses on Type II kerogen, as it is the most common overall source of presently produced hydrocarbons. Two different chemical structures of type-II kerogen (C175H102N4O9S2, C242H219N5O12S2) are used as the building blocks to simulate the solid kerogen. The molar fractions of the elements are controlled to satisfy the overall H/C and O/C ratio of type-II kerogen in the oil window. The simulated hydrocarbon fluid consists of nine different types of molecules: dimethylnaphthalene, toluene, tetradecane, decane, octane, butane, propane, ethane and methane. The simulation box containing these molecules is subjected to a slow quenching process, which continues down to the reservoir temperature and pressure conditions. The effects of maximum temperature and the rate of quenching on the pore morphology of kerogen and the distribution of oil in the pore-network are discussed. We explain how kerogen pore morphology is controlled by the quenching rates. Next, we simulate the interaction of microemulsion droplets with the digital kerogen. Results show that the microemulsion droplets posess elastic properties which allow them to squeeze through the kerogen pores smaller than the droplet's own diameter and to adsorb at pore wall surfaces. One major benefit associated with the use of microemulsions is the ability of the droplets to transport and deliver solvents and surfactants to different parts of the pore network. Our work shows that solvents and surfactants with particular features can be delivered in the form of a microemulsion droplet into oil saturated kerogen pore network and influence the oil mobility.

                    "abstract": "Much work has been done targeting hydrocarbon fluids in organic materials of source rocks such as kerogen and bitumen. These were, however, limited in scope to simple fluids confined in nanopores and ignored multi-component effects. Recent studies using hydrocarbon mixtures revealed that compositional variation caused by selective adsorption and nano-confinement significantly alters the fluids phase equilibrium properties. One important consequence of this behavior is capillary condensation and trapping of hydrocarbons in nanopores. Fluid expansion is not an effective mechanism in these pores. To show the impact of lean gas injection on the hydrocarbons recovery, an investigation is carried out using equilibrium molecular simulations of hydrocarbon mixtures with varying concentrations of CO2. The results with N2 are also presented for comparison. We show that large molecules in the mixture are left behind in nanopores are generally responsible for the residual hydrocarbon amount, and that high-pressure CO2 injection extracts more hydrocarbons from the nanopores than that based on pressure depletion only. In these small pores, the injection pressure and the kind of injected gas play a critical role in recovery. We also show that the nanopore surface area, rather than the nanopore size, is the primary factor affecting the residual amount. CO2 molecules introduced into the nanpores during the soaking period of a cyclic injection operation lead to exchange of molecules and a shift in the phase equilibrium properties of the confined fluids. This exchange has a stripping effect and in turn enhances the hydrocarbons recovery. However, the subsequent production and pressure depletion has no additional impact on the recovery beyond the stripping effect. CO2 injection and soaking has the ability to extract the heavier hydrocarbon fluids irrespective of the operating pressure conditions, while the pressure depletion produces the lighter fluids from the nanopores.

                    "abstract": "Shale gas reservoirs hold adsorbed gas in kerogen. Laboratory techniques have been developed to measure the gas amount in samples. However, adsorbed gas recovery is an unsettled issue. Complexity is mainly due to adsorbed phase having an unknown composition and density, and desorbing in a selective fashion. Kerogen nanopores bring in added complexity to the analysis due to confinement effects. Our objective is to predict gas composition in kerogen pores and measure desorption limit during pressure depletion. A new molecular simulation method is developed to predict in-situ composition of natural gas in model kerogen pores using composition of produced fluid from a Chinese shale gas well. In essence, the method re-distributes the fluid composition back into kerogen pores at initial reservoir conditions. Then one-by-one the pores are blown down in small pressure steps while the compositional variation in the pores is monitored. The recovery is measured by comparing the residual hydrocarbon molecules at different pressure steps during the blow down. Density, viscosity, mean free path of the fluids in model kerogen pores are computed using the trajectories of the adsorbed and free molecules. At initial reservoir conditions we found that the gas mixture in kerogen nanopores becomes heavier and more viscous as the pore size becomes smaller. These compositional effects become significantly more amplified during the pressure depletion. Consequently, we observe that the kerogen pores release only the lighter end of the initial natural gas mixture in the pores, not allowing desorption of the heavier mixtures in smaller pores. The predicted Knudsen number values indicate that the compositional evolution in kerogen with pore size and pressure does not allow flow regime change. For the Chinese shale gas well fluid composition, we predict that the pores smaller than 5 nm has limited gas recovery and the transport in the larger pores stays in the slip flow regime. The paper presents results of recovery from kerogen using molecular simulation of fluids in nanopores. The results bring in new insights into our understanding of the natural gas production limits from kerogen. The results indicate that methane adsorption isotherms do not represent the true nature of multi-component gas desorption from shale samples. "

                    "abstract": "Inherently coupled flow and geomechanics processes in fractured shale media have implications for shale gas production. The system involves highly complex geo-textures comprised of a heterogeneous anisotropic fracture network spatially embedded in an ultra-tight matrix. In addition, nonlinearities due to viscous flow, diffusion, and desorption in the matrix and high velocity gas flow in the fractures complicates the transport. In this paper, we develop a multiscale model reduction approach to couple gas flow and geomechanics in fractured shale media. A Discrete Fracture Model (DFM) is used to treat the complex network of fractures on a fine grid. The coupled flow and geomechanics equations are solved using a fixed stress-splitting scheme by solving the pressure equation using a continuous Galerkin method and the displacement equation using an interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method. We develop a coarse grid approximation and coupling using the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). GMsFEM constructs the multiscale basis functions in a systematic way to capture the fracture networks and their interactions with the shale matrix. Numerical results and an error analysis is provided showing that the proposed approach accurately captures the coupled process using a few multiscale basis functions, i.e. a small fraction of the degrees of freedom of the fine-scale problem.

The multiscale method allowed us to capture detailed interactions between the fractures and the background. For the fine-scale heterogeneities involving organic and inorganic materials distribution in the matrix, we use a dual-continuum approach. The matrix is coupled to the fractures by use of the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In our previous work (Akkutlu et al., 2016), we used a single-continuum background coupled to the fracture network. This paper presents a significant extension and considers dual-continuum media as a background. GMsFEM systematically identifies the fracture networks by constructing corresponding multiscale basis functions. GMsFEM also accurately represents the fractures interacting with the background media. Moreover, GMsFEM can handle any spatial fracture distributions and thus, it avoids the limitations of the multi-continuum approaches. Results show that the proposed numerical approach can accurately capture the interactions between the fractures and the multi-continuum model using a few multiscale basis functions. "

However, the size of the current models is much smaller than the representative elementary volume of organic in order to describe the macroscopic quantities such as diffusion coefficents and permeability. In addition, pore size distribution of the current models is skewed towards the lower end such that the predicted quantities are inaccurate. A new methodology is presented to build larger organic models to overcome the scale-dependence issue. A solid organic skeleton can be built using 3D tomographs which can be obtained from high-resolution microscopy such as TEM. The skeleton is populated with atoms distributed based on the organic matters maturity and elemental composition. As part of the new methodology to build larger organic model, we replace the atoms that make up the skeleton with an average representative atom whose bond length with the surrounding representative atoms is tuned to maintain the solid density and the structure of the skeleton unchanged. The average force field parameters are calculated based on kerogen's elemental composition. Permeability of this simplified organic model is measured using molecular dynamics simulation of steady-state fluid flow through the model pore-network. When the transport simulation results of the simplified organic model are compared to its counterpart carrying exact molecular description, the simplified model is accurate for the calculations of permeability, tortuosity, and saturations and reduced the computational cost significantly. The simplified model can be applied to large samples and plugged into the existing digital rock workflows, to utilize meaningful pore connection information provided from tomograhy. "

However a comprehensive understanding of the source rock geochemistry is currently needed in order to identify key factors in resource shale hydrocarbon assessment and production forecasting. Previous works indicated that significant amount of methane is stored in kerogen in adsorbed state. Adsorption is controlled by surface area and surface properties of the kerogen nanopore walls. In this paper using molecular simulations we investigate the influence of surface chemistry and heterogeneity on methane storage in model kerogen pores. The results show excess amount of methane due to nanopore confinement effect, which is found to be most pronounced under the subsurface conditions when the reservoir pore pressure is in the range of 1000–5000 psi. Among the investigated surface heterogeneities, nitrogen-doped graphene surfaces are the most influential on methane storage. Doping affects strongly the Langmuir parameters related to the adsorption capacity. These results indicate that kerogen maturation and the associated changes in its composition has the potential to impact gas storage in resource shale formations. The work gives new insights into the potential impact of the surface chemistry on natural gas storage in kerogen and emphasizes the significance of source rock geochemistry. "

The model accounts for the presence of dispersed kerogen with sorbed-gas corrected dynamic porosity. The Maxwell-Stefan theory is used to predict pressure- and composition-dependence of molecular diffusion in the formation. The equations are discretized and solved numerically by use of the control-volume finite-element method (CVFEM). The simulation is derived from a new multiscale conceptual flow model. We consider that kerogen is dispersed at a fine scale in the inorganic matrix and that it will be the discontinuous component of total porosity at the reservoir-simulation scale, which could be up to six orders of magnitude larger. A simple mass-balance equation is introduced to enable kerogen to transfer gas to the inorganic matrix that is collocated in the same gridblock. The convective/diffusive transport takes place between neighboring gridblocks only in the inorganic matrix. The simulation results show that the multiscale nature of the rock is important and should not be ignored because this could result in an overestimation of the contribution of the discontinuous kerogen. We also observe that although adsorbed fluid could contribute significantly to storage in the shale formation, its contribution to production could be severely limited by the lack of kerogen continuity at the reservoir scale and by a low degree of coupling between the organic and inorganic pores. The contribution of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion to the overall transport in the shale formation increases as the inorganic matrix permeability is reduced because of pressure decline during production.

                    "abstract": "Resource shales have low permeability matrix with nanoporous features. At nano scale in situ fluids experience strong fluid-wall interactions and confinement effects. The hydrocarbons recovery from the nanopore network is therefore limited. Microemulsions are known to be effective in stimulating oil and gas production from non-conventional reservoirs, however their mechanisms of action, as well as their ability to penetrate into nanosize pores of shale matrix during an operation such as hydraulic fracturing needs to be investigated. In this paper, we investigate the conditions for the microemulsion droplet penetration into model nanopores, identify the penetration mechanisms and, following their penetration, analyze their interactions with model organic and inorganic walls, and study their behavior in confinement. Molecular dynamics simulation is employed to simulate the behavior of a nanodroplet dispersion facing a solid surface. The model nanodroplets comprise swollen micelles of C12E7 nonionic surfactant with the d-limonene solvent solubilized in their cores. An oil-wet solid surface is modeled using graphite to represent hydrophobic kerogen in shale, and a water-wet solid surface is modeled using brucite to represent hydrophilic inorganic materials in shale. These surfaces are considered to have nanocapillaries with varying sizes, available for the microemulsion penetration experiment. Our results indicate that penetration into capillaries with sizes less than 10 nm is strongly influenced by the wettability of the solid surface. In the case of an oil-wet solid surface the droplets adsorb on the surfaces and hence impact the penetration ability. In the case of a water-wet surface, however, microemulsion droplets effectively penetrate into the nanocapillaries. The droplets are capable of penetrating into the capillaries that are smaller than their own size. In both of these two cases, the solubilized solvent and the surfactant are delivered into a tight nanocapillary network and come into contact with the in situ hydrocarbons. This research can be extended to include ionic surfactants, varying salinity, and more complex solid surfaces to develop the next generation microemulsions with superior performance in enhancing oil production from the unconventional reservoirs.

This work presents a compositional model for the flow of a multi-component hydrocarbon gas and CO2 in a deformable porous medium consisting of an inorganic and an organic matrix. The fully-coupled equations for fluid transport and geomechanics are solved using the Control Volume Finite Element Method. This work presents a mathematical model for CO2 storage in shales. The model accounts for the dispersed nature of kerogen in shale and can describe the advective and diffusive transport of the hydrocarbon components and CO2. The pressure- dependence of diffusion is modeled using the Maxwell-Stefan model, while desorption of the hydrocarbon species and adsorption of CO2 in kerogen is modeled with the Extended Langmuir Isotherm. The governing equations are solved implicitly for coupled geomechanics and flow. The developed simulator is used to model the primary depletion of a representative Barnett shale-gas reservoir, as well as the storage of CO2 in this depleted reservoir under various conditions. The simulation results from this work indicate that the storage capacity of organic-rich shales could be overestimated if we do not account for the pore-volume reduction due to the pore space occupied by the adsorbed gas. During primary recovery from organic-rich shales, the pore-pressure drops and some of the gases adsorbed on the surface of the organic pore walls are produced. This results in an increase in the pore volume available for subsequent CO2 storage. However, the pore-pressure drop also results in an increased effective stress, which could lead to a reduction in fracture conductivity and cumulative production. The model and simulator presented is capable of modeling the relative contributions of these coupled phenomena and the attending effect on CO2 storage. "

                    "abstract": "Recent studies on multi-phase fluids in nanoscale capillaries indicated that the capillary wall-fluid interactions could play a dominant role on the co-existence of the phases, which may change the fundamental properties of the fluids, such as density, viscosity, and interfacial tension. At the extreme of the confinement, these properties become vague. This raises a serious question on the validity of Young-Laplace equation to predict capillary pressure in small capillaries that the unconventional resources commonly exhibit. In this paper, using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of mercury injection into model nanocapillaries, the nature of multi-phase fluids is investigated in capillaries with sizes below 20nm, and the Young-Laplace equation is re-visited. Higher capillary pressure is predicted for the model nanocapillaries used in the simulations compared to that value obtained using the Young-Laplace equation, in particular, when the capillary diameter is less than 10nm. Good agreement found with the theory in larger size capillary. The capillary pressure increases as the capillary size is decreased and shows a power-law dependence onthe size of the capillary. This dependence yields up to 70% increase in the estimated capillary pressure value for the extreme case of 1nm capillary. Higher tangential local pressures at the nanocapillary entry resulted from the adsorption phase is the cause of the difference. Based on the observations, a modified Young-Laplace equation is proposed for mercury-airfilled pore systems which are commonly used in Mercury Injection Capillary Pressure (MICP) experiments for the pore volume and pore size distribution measurements. At the highest injection pressure of MICP, the minimum captured size is predicted 4.8nm instead of 3.6nm based on the Young-Laplace equation. The increase in the predicted capillary size leads to an increase in total pore volume of the sample. The error in volume is up to 20% for measurements with shale samples. The results are important for the characterization of resource shale formations because the nanopore volume correction influence the hydrocarbon in-place and reserve calculations. The work can be extended to other multi-phase systems, such as oil-water, and water-gas, grouping with other capillary wall material to study the behavior of multi-phase flow in nanocapillaries. "

Organic-rich shales and mudstones are the source rocks and reservoirs for conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources. Mudrocks are relied upon as natural barriers for geological carbon storage and nuclear waste disposal. Consideration of mudrock multi-scale physics and multi-scale spatial and temporal behavior is vital to address emergent phenomena in shale formations perturbed by engineering activities. Unique physical characteristics of shales arise as a result of their layered and highly heterogeneous and anisotropic nature, low permeability fabric, compositional complexity, and nano-scale confined chemical environments. Barriers of lexicon among geoscientists and engineers impede the development and use of conceptual models for the coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical-biological (THMCB) processes in mudrock formations. This manuscript reviews the THMCB process couplings, resulting emergent behavior, and key modeling approaches. We identify future research priorities, in particular fundamental knowledge gaps in understanding the phase behavior under nano-scale confinement, coupled chemo-mechanical effects on fractures, the interplay between physical and chemical processes and their rates, and issues of non-linearity and heterogeneity. We develop recommendations for future research and integrating multi-disciplinary conceptual models for the coupled multi-scale multi-physics behavior of mudrocks. Consistent conceptual models across disciplines are essential for predicting emergent processes in the subsurface, such as self-focusing of flow, time-dependent deformation (creep), fracture network development, and wellbore stability.

                    "abstract": "Existing strategies for oil and gas recovery are designed on the basis of macroscopic properties of the produced hydrocarbon fluids. However, recent studies on source rocks revealed that properties of fluids stored in nanopores of the organic constituent material kerogen deviate from the bulk behavior. Hence, the traditional equation-of-state (EOS) and fluid-properties correlations are no longer applicable. This, in turn, leads to added uncertainties in hydrocarbon-in-place and recovery calculations for the source rocks that are rich in kerogen. In this paper, we seek to address the question at a fundamental level from the thermodynamics standpoint by simulating isothermal expansion of a quinary hydrocarbon mixture in a model nanopore under typical subsurface conditions, and measuring the fluid composition and amount. Molecular Monte Carlo simulations are used to investigate the equilibrium relationship between the bulk fluid at the outside of the pore and the remaining mixture inside during the stages of pressure depletion. The fluid stored in nanopores shows a composition that varies significantly with the pore size. The smaller the pore is, the heavier becomes the mixture that is in equilibrium with the bulk fluid. During the depletion, the small hydrocarbon molecules escape readily from the pores. The composition of the remaining fluid inside the pore thus becomes progressively heavier and viscous. We show that nanopore confinement significantly limits the release of hydrocarbon molecules from the pores with sizes smaller than 10 nm. For each hydrocarbon component, a strong correlation exists between molar fractions of the component in the produced fluid with that which remained inside the pore. This correlation can serve in future studies as the basis for establishing alternative methods for reservoir-engineering calculations, such as the ultimate recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Molecular-dynamics simulation is used to investigate the nature of two-phase (oil/water) flow in organic capillaries. The capillary wall is modeled with graphite to represent kerogen pores in liquid-rich resource shale. We consider that the water carries a nonionic surfactant and a solubilized terpene solvent in the form of a microemulsion, and that it was previously introduced to the capillary during hydraulic-fracturing operation. The water has already displaced a portion of the oil in place mechanically and now occupies the central part of the capillary. The residual oil, on the other hand, stays by the capillary walls as a stagnant film. Equilibrium simulations show that, under the influence of organic walls, the solvent inside the microemulsion droplets enables not only the surfactant but also the complete droplet to adsorb to the interfaces. Hence, delivering the surfactant molecules to the oil/water interface is achieved faster and more effectively in the organic capillaries. After the droplet arrives at the interface, the droplet breaks down and the solvent dissolves into the oil film and diffuses. This process is similar to drug delivery at nanoscale. Using nonequilibrium simulations based on the external force-field approach, we numerically performed steady-state flow measurements to establish that the solvent and the surfactant molecules play separate roles that are both essential in mobilizing the oil film. The surfactant deposited at the oil/water interface reduces the surface tension and acts as a linker that diminishes the slip at the interface. Hence, it effectively enables momentum transfer from the mobile water phase to the stagnant oil film. The solvent penetrating the oil film, on the other hand, modifies flow properties of the oil. In addition, as a result of selective adsorption, the solvent displaces the adsorbed oil molecules and transforms that portion of the oil into the free oil phase. Consequently, the fractional flow of oil is additionally increased in the presence of solvent. The results of this work are important for understanding the effect of microemulsion on flow in organic capillaries and its effect on shale-oil recovery. "

This indicates that the measured quantity is influenced by several mechanisms that add complexity to the measurement. The complexity is mainly caused by stress dependence of the matrix permeability. Also, it is because organic-rich shale holds significant volumes of fluids in sorbed (adsorbed, dissolved) states; sorption can also influence the permeability through its own storage and transport mechanisms. The stress-dependence and sorption effects on permeability could develop under the reservoir conditions and influence the production, although we currently do not have a predictive permeability model that considers their coexistence. In this work, this is accomplished by considering that the shale matrix consists of multiple continua with organic and inorganic pores. Stress dependency of the permeability comes along with slit-shaped pores, whereas the sorption effects are associated with nanscale organic capillaries. A simple conceptual flow model with an apparent shale permeability is developed that couples the molecular-transport effects of the sorbed phase with the stress dependence of the slit-shaped pores. The simulation results show the impact of the permeability model on the production. Sensitivity analysis on the new permeability model shows that the stress dependence of the overall transport is significant at high pore pressure, when the effective stress is relatively low. Diffusive molecular transport of the sorbed phase becomes important as the stress gets larger and, hence, the slit-shaped pores close. The constructed apparent-permeability vs. pore-pressure curves show the dominance of the molecular transport as an increase in permeability characterized by appearance of a minimum permeability value at the intermediate values of the pressure. One can use the new permeability model easily in history matching a well performance and optimizing its production. "

This, in turn, leads to large capillary wall surface area and, consequently, to a significant physical adsorption effect. Measurements are needed to understand the nature of flow inside kerogen structures. However, direct measurements are difficult and have large uncertainties related to kerogen isolation. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation allow numerical study of fluid transport inside model nano-capillaries representative of kerogen matrices. In this work two different molecular simulation methods are used to study steady-state flow of methane and of methane-butane mixture: External Field Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (EF- NEMD), the main flow simulation method, and Dual Control Volume Grand Canonical Molecular Dynamics (DCV-GCMD), the simulation method used to verify the results. The flow inside the capillary is simulated under various conditions, e.g., capillary diameter, temperature, average pressure, fluid composition and capillary wall morphology. Based on the simulation results we observe that fluid flow velocity and mass flux are significant near the capillary surfaces where adsorption takes place. Hence, Hagen-Poiseuille equation based on the no-flow condition at the wall significantly under-estimates the fluid flow in nanocapillary. The dependence of surface transport velocity, as well as flow enhancement, are determined quantitatively.

                    "abstract": "Much work has been done to demonstrate an economical impact of various fluid transport mechanisms on the long term behavior of shale gas production. These studies were elementary level and focused on identifying a dominant mechanism of production. They did not consider, however, the interaction of the fractures with the shale matrices in detail. In the near wellbore environment the fracture is the crucial component of transport, whereas the matrix is the place for storage. In this paper, using a new in-house reservoir flow simulator, we introduce the nature of this interaction and show that the transport in the tight matrix can be induced by carefully designing the well completions and by operating under the optimum production conditions. The simulator accounts for a hydraulic fracture coupled to shale matrix with an anistropic apparent permeability field, which is stress-sensitive and includes the effects of molecular transport phenomena. The fracture has a dynamic conductivity with a simple nonlinear deformation rule reflecting proppant embedment effect on the conductivity. Using a sector model, we predict short-term cumulative production trends. The results indicate that design of horizontal wells with multiple fractures should take into account the geomechanical and diffusional resistances associated with the gas transport in the matrices. Further, in-series nature of the production indicates that changes in fracture conductivity beyond its threshold value has negligible effect on the production trends. Therefore, production optimization efforts should instead focus to considerations to improve the flow rates in the matrix. "

                    "abstract": "A new mathematical model is introduced based on the Maxwell–Stefan formulation to simulate multi-component (CH4–CO2) transport in resource shale. The approach considers competitive transport and adsorption effects in the organic (kerogen) micropores of the shale during CO2 injection and enhanced CH4 recovery. Following the primary production, injection of CO2 into organic-rich shale initiates co- and counter-diffusive transport and competitive sorption among the molecules. Consequently, the incoming CO2 molecules activate and displace the in-place CH4 molecules. Competitive sorption rates, however, could be controlled by the diffusive mass fluxes during the injection and production operations. Nature of the transport processes should therefore be understood clearly. In this paper, we first show that the widely used single-component Langmuir gas behavior is, in fact, a limiting case of the generalized formulation. The latter, however, includes not only the anticipated binary effects (due to the co-existence of two components with different molecular size and adsorption capacity) but also additional nonlinear effects due to the direction of diffusive mass fluxes and to the lateral interactions of the adsorbed gas molecules in the micropores. Following, we incorporate the multi-component formulation to a shale gas flow model to consider CO2 injection and enhanced shale gas recovery processes in a single horizontal well setup with multiple fractures. The simulation involves primary gas production for ten years followed by three-stages of operations including injection of CO2 for five years, a short soaking period, and finally production for 30 years. Dynamics of the production stages is then investigated with varying initial/boundary conditions. It is shown that the counter diffusion and competitive adsorption in the micropores could generate nontrivial effects at the reservoir-scale such that the predicted CH4 production is significantly enhanced. The investigation is important for our understanding and the design of CO2 injection and enhanced shale gas recovery processes. "

In this work, a new gas-storagemeasurement technique is proposed that combines the porosity and sorptionmeasurements. Because the measurement is performed by use of core plug underconfining stress, it allows investigating the storage capacity for varyingeffective stress and incorporating the storage data into a subsequentpermeability measurement under the same conditions. During the construction of the sorption isotherm in the laboratory with thevolumetric (gas expansion) method, at each pressure step, the sorbed gas takenup by the sample reduces the pore volume (PV) of the sample. As a result, theinitially determined PV at low pressure must be corrected at the beginning andat the end of the pressure step. This correction can be performed relativelyeasily during the routine sorption measurements with the crushed samples;however, it is a challenging task with core plugs under confining stressbecause at each pressure step the PV could also change as a result of porecompressibility. Our approach is based on a new analytical model of total gasstorability developed to interpret the measured multiple-step pressure data ona graphical domain in which the storage-parameter estimation can be performedfast and accurately with a straight line. The approach considers both thecompressibility and sorbed-phase effects on the porosity and the sorptionparameters. Experimental storage data of shale and coal samples with varying totalorganic content (TOC) and maturity are used to demonstrate the applicability ofthe analytical method to the measurements.

These pores have gas species-specific adsorption on the surface of the pore walls and are in material that may have significant pore-volume dependence on pore pressure. In the smaller pores molecular-dynamic calculations for methane show that the storage model that consists of a single high density adsorbed gas layer and a free-gas component that obeys the equation-of-state for bulk methane is only an approximation. The volume of the adsorption layer, which reduces the pore volume available for free gas storage, is a function of gas species, temperature and pressure. This, along with pore-volume compressibility, requires that gas storage be measured with the reservoir gas under reservoir conditions on a solid core sample. The current methods that use ground-up samples to measure adsorption with the reservoir gas but pore volume with helium do not satisfy the requirements for an accurate gas-storage determination. To address these issues, a new methodology to measure total gas storage on a core sample at reservoir conditions is described. A method to model the measured storage as an adsorbed component and free component is developed. For methane, an equation to extract an average pore radius from the modeled adsorbed-state density is developed. The methodology is illustrated on a measurement on an organic-shale sample. "

                    "abstract": "Because of commodity pricing, the production from organic rich shales such as Barnett, Woodford, Eagle Ford and Marcellus has shifted significantly away from the dry natural gas window into the more profitable condensate and liquid hydrocarbon (oil) windows. The current production practices, however, are based mainly on field experience of the operators and far from being a methodological approach for an optimized production. This is mainly due to the fact that our understanding of condensation, capillarity and multi-phase flow dynamics in shale reservoirs is at an infancy stage. It is currently not known, for example, if and where the condensation takes place in the reservoir, and what is the impact of the shale matrix on the this phenomenon. In this paper we argue that answering these questions using conventional laboratory measurement techniques is a difficult task because the fluid properties and the phase behavior of the hydrocarbons could be influenced by the nanoporous nature of these rocks.  Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to investigate pure hydrocarbon vapor-liquid coexistence and critical properties under confinement. The results show a pore size dependence of these thermo-physical properties. Phase diagrams generated using ternary (C1, C4, and C8) mixtures under reservoir conditions show a two-phase envelop shift due to pore size dependence. We show the importance of the results performing a shale gas in-place calculation using Ambrose's equation where the equation of state parameters, z-factor, gas formation volume factor, and adsorbed-phase density values are all adjusted for a range of effective pore size. The corrections on the free and the sorbed gas in-place estimates are significant. Furthermore, we predicted reserves from wet gas, condensate, and volatile oil reservoirs using compositional flow simulation. It is shown that the liquid production from nanoporous rocks is enhanced due to a significant decrease in the bubble point and dew point pressures.   Introduction Pore characterization of resource shale is a fundamental step towards the estimation of gas-in-place and reserve. The resource shale structure is made up of organic and inorganic materials. Molecular phenomena such as adsorption and capillary condensation mainly take place within kerogen. Kerogen is the organic nanoporous material that is dispersed within the inorganic shale matrix (Ambrose, 2011). Scanning electron microscopy studies have previously shown that the size of these nanopores is well in the range of 1-100 nanometers (nm). Using nitrogen adsorption porosimetry Adesida et al. (2011) reported Barnett shale samples having pores detected as micro- and meso-pores with sizes on average less than 10nm. Kang et al. (2011) showed that these organic nanopores store a significant portion of the total gas-in-place in the sorbed and free-gas states, depending on the pore pressure and temperature. On the other hand, it is almost a well-known fact that some thermophysical properties of fluids under confinement in nanopores deviate from their bulk values (Gelb et al., 1999). In such extremely small scales, the effect of the walls on the molecules becomes more pronounced, inducing a different behavior of the fluid than from the bulk state in the absence of the walls. Taking into account these important facts seems inevitable in current studies of shale reserves and production schemes. "

The difference is due to kinetic effects of gas molecules that have gone through inelastic collisions with the capillary walls on those molecules that make up the bulk fluid in the capillary. The kinetic energy that the bouncing-back molecules have and the associated momentum carried to the bulk fluid is not a trivial matter in capillaries with diameter, h, less than 100 nm. Momentum carried by bouncing-back molecules amplifies the velocity profile developing across the diameter of the capillary. In a sense, it is not only the molecules interacting with the capillary wall that slip but also those interacting with the bulk fluid, i.e., double‐slip. The double-slip effect is shown using measured permeability data of two crushed nano-porous samples, Pyrophyllite, and three different shale samples at varying pore pressures. Using the simulation results, we propose a modification to the Klinkenberg equation. Our new double-slip Klinkenberg equation includes a characteristic length scale (LKe) that is proportional to the kinetic energy per capillary cross-sectional area of the bouncing-back molecules by the capillary walls. The new length scale of the molecular kinetic effects in nano-capillaries is larger than the mean free path of the molecules. The double-slip Klinkenberg equation reduces to the classical equation for slip flow in large capillaries, i.e., h/LKe >> 1, and converges to the absolute permeability value at high pressure. "

The formulation includes dual-porosity continua, where shale permeability is associated with inorganic matrix with relatively large irregularly shaped pores and fractures, whereas molecular phenomena (diffusive transport and nonlinear sorption) are associated with the kerogen pores. Kerogen is considered a nanoporous organic material finely dispersed within the inorganic matrix. The formulation is used to model and history match gas-permeation measurements in the laboratory using shale core plugs under confining stress. The results indicate significance of molecular transport and strong transient effects caused by gas/solid interactions within the kerogen. In the second part of the paper, we present a novel multiscale perturbation approach to quantify the overall impact of local porosity fluctuations associated with a spatially nonuniform kerogen distribution on the adsorption and transport in shale gas reservoirs. Adopting weak-noise and mean-field approximation, the approach applies a stochastic upscaling technique to the mathematical formulation developed in the first part for the laboratory. It allows us to investigate local kerogenheterogeneity effects in spectral (Fourier-Laplace) domain and to obtain an upscaled \"macroscopic\" model, which consists of the local heterogeneity effects in the real time-space domain. The new upscaled formulation is compared numerically with the previous homogeneous case using finite-difference approximations to initial/boundary value problems simulating the matrix gas release. We show that macrotransport and macrokinetics effects of kerogen heterogeneity are nontrivial and affect cumulative gas recovery. The work is important and timely for development of new-generation shale-gas reservoir-flow simulators, and it can be used in the laboratory for organic-rich gas-shale characterization. "

In general, these are low-Reynolds number and noncontinuum effects and, more importantly, porewall-dominated multiscale effects. In this study, we introduce a new lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to investigate these effects numerically in simple pore geometries. The standard method was developed in the 1980s to overcome the weaknesses of lattice gas cellular automata and has emerged recently as a powerful tool to solve fluid dynamics problems, in particular in the areas of micro- and nanofluidics. The new approach takes into account molecular-level interactions by use of adsorptive/cohesive forces among the fluid particles and defining a Langmuir-slip boundary condition at the organic pore walls. The model allows us to partition mass transport by the walls into two components: slippage of free gas molecules and hopping (or surface transport) of the adsorbed gas molecules. By use of the standard 2D D2Q9 lattice, low-Reynolds-number gas dynamics is simulated in a 100-nm model organic capillary and later in a bundle of smaller-sized organic nanotubes. The results point to the existence of a critical Knudsen number value for the onset of laminar gas flow under typical shale-gas-reservoir pressure conditions. Beyond this number, the predicted velocity profile shows that the mechanisms of slippage and surface transport could lead to molecular streaming by the pore walls, which enhances the gas transport in the organic nanopores. The work is important for development of new-generation shale-gas-reservoir flow simulators, and it can be used in the laboratory for organic-rich-shale characterization. "

The organic material has pores and capillaries having characteristic lengths typically less than 100 nm. A significant portion of total gas in place appears to be associated with interconnected large nanopores within the organic material. Thermodynamics (phase behavior) of fluids in these pores is quite different; gas residing in a small pore or capillary is rarefied under the influence of organic pore walls and shows a different density profile. This raises serious questions related to gas-in-place calculations: Under reservoir conditions, what fraction of the pore volume of the organic material can be considered available as free gas, and what fraction is taken up by the adsorbed phase? How accurately is the shale-gas storage capacity estimated using the conventional volumetric methods? And finally, do average densities exist for the free and the adsorbed phases? We combine the Langmuir adsorption isotherm with the volumetrics for free gas and formulate a new gas-in-place equation accounting for the pore space taken up by the sorbed phase. The method yields a total-gas-in-place prediction. Molecular dynamics simulations involving methane in small carbon slit-pores of varying size and temperature predict density profiles across the pores and show that (a) the adsorbed methane forms a 0.38 nm monolayer phase and (b) the adsorbed-phase density is 1.8 - 2.5 times larger than that of bulk methane. These findings could be a more important consideration with larger hydrocarbons and suggest that a significant adjustment is necessary in volume calculations, especially for gas shales high in total organic content. Finally, using typical values for the parameters, calculations show a 10 - 25% decrease in total gas-storage capacity compared with that using the conventional approach. The role of sorbed gas is more important than previously thought. The new methodology is recommended for estimating shale gas in place. "

Due to nanoporous nature of coals and organic-rich shales, the double-slip effect is likely to be significant near hydraulic fractures and production wells in depleted reservoirs.  The presented theoretical work brings new insights into the measurement of crushed particle permeability using gas uptake or release experiments. Although they are fast low-pressure laboratory measurements, there are widely-recognized uncertainties associated with them. In this paper we show that dramatic variation in the measured permeability is possible due to small changes in the measurement cell pressure. Hence, even when the crushed sample is considered to be representative of the reservoir, the measured permeability may not quantitatively be related to flow under the reservoir conditions. The double-slip permeability concept and the modified Klinkenberg theory eliminate some of the uncertainties associated with the laboratory measurement of permeability and lead to development of new measurement protocols for the unconventional resources industry. A double-slip Klinkenberg chart is developed including the effects of nano-capillaries on the permeability, and two procedures are presented with example calculations on how to use the chart to predict permeability of shale sample from its effective pore size and shape.  1. Introduction Laboratory procedures of isothermal gas permeation lead to higher apparent permeability for porous sample. Explanation for this behavior has been given by Klinkenberg (1941) in his seminal work that takes into account phenomena of slip. Accordingly, steady-state flow rate through small capillaries is higher due to slippage of gas molecules by the capillary walls. The slip is dependent on the type of permeating gas and the average pore pressure applied; consequently, the measured permeability values for the sample could vary significantly. The theory also yields a widely-known graphical technique that displays the permeability variations with respect to reciprocal of the average pore pressure on a straight-line with an intercept equal to the absolute permeability of the sample and a slope related to mean free path of the gas molecules.

Permeabilities are measured on core plugs or crushed samples using unsteady state techniques. However, the resultant permeabilities are the sources of controversy, because of the inconsistency in the permeability values produced with different techniques and different laboratories. In this research we evaluated the experimental factors which could influence permeability measurements with the GRI technique, and also present some permeability measurements on shale plugs. To evaluate the GRI permeability measurement technique on crushed rock, we investigated the effect of particle size, sieving of the crushed samples, pore pressure, different gases, and initial state of the measurement apparatus. The measured crushed shale permeabilities display a dependency on all these parameters. However, the particle size and the pore pressure appear to be the more important factors. This makes the reported values strongly dependent on the exact measurement procedure. This study was complemented by the imaging of crushed shale samples with a micro-CT scanner. These images showed the presence of microcracks even in samples as small as the recommended GRI particle size (~0.7mm). The permeabilities of several Devonian and Ordovician age shale plugs were measured with a pressure build up technique using nitrogen as flowing gas. A permeability decrease by an order of magnitude was generally observed for the Ordovician shale plugs with an increase of confining pressure from 1000 to 5000 psi. For the same Ordovician shale, the permeability anisotropy was found to be close to 2 orders of magnitude.The permeability of the Devonian shale plugs decreased by a maximum of 3 orders of magnitude over the range of confining pressure. For most shales, the confining pressure dependency of permeability is driven by cracks which is confirmed by a fit to Walsh's crack permeability model. However, we also noticed that it is possible to close the cracks contained in some plugs and obtain a value more representative of matrix permeability. Introduction The advents of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal well technology have unlocked considerable reserves of hydrocarbon contained in shale formations. However, petrophyicists and reservoir engineers still face the challenges in quantifying key petrophysical properties. One of the ellusive petrophysical properties is permeability. Permeability measurement methods in shale formations have been the source of controversy, mainly because of the inconsistency among measurements from different laboratories (Sondergeld et al., 2010). The present research is designed to understand the causes of these inconsistencies noticed among measurements from different laboratory. An outcome is a proposed a measurement method which limits the variability in permeability measurement. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study on the ability of organic-rich-shale core samples to store carbon dioxide (CO2). An apparatus has been built for precise measurements of gas pressure and volumes at constant temperature. A new analytical methodology is developed allowing interpretation of the pressure/volume data in terms of measurements of total porosity and Langmuir parameters of core plugs. The method considers pore-volume compressibility and sorption effects and allows small gas-leakage adjustments at high pressures. Total gas-storage capacity for pure CO2 is measured at supercritical conditions as a function of pore pressure under constant reservoir-confining pressure. It is shown that, although widely known as an impermeable sedimentary rock with low porosity, organic shale has the ability to store significant amount of gas permanently because of trapping of the gas in an adsorbed state within its finely dispersed organic matter (i.e., kerogen). The latter is a nanoporous material with mainly micropores (< 2 nm) and mesopores (2 - 50 nm). Storage in organic-rich shale has added advantages because the organic matter acts as a molecular sieve, allowing CO2--with linear molecular geometry?to reside in small pores that the other naturally occurring gases cannot access. In addition, the molecular-interaction energy between the organics and CO2 molecules is different, which leads to enhanced adsorption of CO2. Hence, affinity of shale to CO2 is partly because of steric and thermodynamic effects similar to those of coals that are being considered for enhanced coalbed-methane recovery. Mass-transport paths and the mechanisms of gas uptake are unlike those of coals, however. Once at the fracture/matrix interface, the injected gas faces a geomechanically strong porous medium with a dual (organic/inorganic) pore system and, therefore, has choices of path for its flow and transport into the matrix: the gas molecules (1) dissolve into the organic material and diffuse through a nanopore network and (2) enter the inorganic material and flow through a network of irregularly shaped voids. Although gas could reach the organic pores deep in the shale formation following both paths, the application of the continua approximation requires that the gas-flow system be near or beyond the percolation threshold for a consistent theoretical framework. Here, using gas permeation experiments and history matching pressure-pulse decay, we show that a large portion of the injected gas reaches the organic pores through the inorganic matrix. This is consistent with scanning-electron-microscope (SEM) images that do not show connectivity of the organic material on scales larger than tens of microns. It indicates an in-series coupling of the dual continua in shale. The inorganic matrix permeability, therefore, is predicted to be less, typically on the order of 10 nd. More importantly, although transport in the inorganic matrix is viscous (Darcy) flow, transport in the organic pores is not due to flow but mainly to molecular transport mechanisms: pore and surface diffusion.

However these images also suggest that the some of the pores and the paths connecting the pores are even smaller. In this study a different set of experimental and computational procedures based on low-temperature gas adsorption measurements are used to provide information about the porous structure of kerogen. The experimental approach involved nitrogen adsorption on crushed Barnett shale samples with sizes less than 500 microns at 77oK. Following the measurements, BET, t-Plot and DFT analyses are carried out and statistical analyses were performed to determine the distribution and the effective pore size of each sample. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in the Gibbs ensemble to predict thermodynamic states of methane in model pores with the resulting effective sizes and to estimate the amounts of adsorbed and free gases under Barnett shale reservoir pressure and temperature. Analysis show that the average organic pore widths of the samples range between 5-7 nm. The amount of adsorbed gas in a pore of this size under reservoir pressure and temperature conditions constitutes about 25% of the total gas in-place. The work is important for reservoir characterization and engineering analysis of gas shales.  Introduction Natural gas plays a key role in meeting global energy demand.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Association, the natural gas production from hydrocarbon rich shale formations is one of the most rapidly changing trends in onshore domestic oil and gas exploration and production.  Shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that can be rich sources of petroleum and natural gas. Shale gas refers to natural gas that is trapped within shale formations. Over the past decade, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has allowed access to large volumes of shale gas that were previously uneconomical to produce. Across the U.S., from the West Coast to the Northeast, some 19 geographic basins are recognized as a source of shale gas, where an estimated 35,000 wells were drilled since 2006. Presently, significant commercial gas shale production occurs in Barnett shale in the Forth Worth Basin, Lewis shale in the San Juan Basin, Antrim shale in the Michigan Basin, Marcellus shale and others in the Appalachian Basin, and New Albany shale in the Illinois Basin. Currently the most active shales are the Barnett, the Haynesville/Bossier, the Antrium, the Fayettevile, the Marcellus, and the New Albany shales.  The Barnett shale is Mississippian age occurring in between the depths of 6,500ft to 8,500ft and is bounded by limestone formation above (Marble Falls Limestone) and below (Chappel Limestone). It covers an area of about 5,000 square miles with an approximate thickness ranging from 100 ft to more than 600 ft. The original gas in-place estimate for the Barnett shale is 327 trillion cubic foot (tcf) with estimated technically recoverable resources of 44 tcf. The Barnett shale gas content is the highest among the major shale plays in the U.S., yielding up to 350 standard cubic foot (scf) gas per ton of rock. Typical reservoir properties of this shale are summarized in Table 1. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies have shown that shale gas industry is incorrectly determining gas-in-place volumes in reservoirs with a large sorption capacity by not properly accounting for the volume occupied by the adsorbed phase. Scanning electron microscopy has discovered nanopores in organic-rich shale with sizes typically in 3-100 nm range; adsorption data show presence of smaller pores and micropores (< 2 nm) as part of the predicted pore size distributions. At pore diameters of this scale the adsorption potential is high and thus the fractional pore volume occupied by adsorbed gas is often substantial. Hence a portion of the total pore volume would be occupied by the adsorbed gas and not available for the free gas molecules. In SPE 131772 a volumetric method, which accounts for the pore volumes occupied by the adsorbed and free gases, has been proposed based on single-component Langmuir adsorption model. In SPE 141416 we recognized the importance and impact of multi-component gas adsorption potential and adsorbed gas density when calculating gas-in-place estimates. We combined the widely used yet thermodynamically inconsistent Extended Langmuir model with volumetrics and free gas composition to formulate a new gas-in-place equation that accounts for the pore space taken up by a multi-component adsorbed gas phase. This paper extends the discussions on the adsorption layer effect of multi-component natural gases. The approach is based on thermodynamically-consistent ideal adsorbed solution (IAS) model to accurately predict adsorbed gas storage capacity for gas mixtures. We expanded on our previous work, where we calculated single-component adsorbed-phase density using molecular modeling and Monte Carlo simulation methods, and propose a new equation-of-state-based analytical approach to predict the adsorbed-phase density of a mixture. In concert, the model improves accuracy of the gas-in-place equations needed to account for the pore space taken up by a multi-component adsorbed phase. The new method yields total gas-in-place predictions, which suggest that an adjustment is necessary in volume calculations, especially for gas shales with high C2+ composition and high in total organic content. The new method is therefore recommended for shale gas-in-place calculations.  Introduction Natural gas production from fine grained, organic rich mudstones/siltstones (i.e., \"shales??) has increased steadily over the last decade. Currently it makes up a large portion of the total gas production in North America and is gaining traction globally. Because of commodity pricing, recent focus has shifted away from producing mature dry shales to more profitable production of shale condensate/natural gas liquids. This has occurred in the Barnett, Woodford, Eagle Ford and Marcellus formations specifically.  One of the primary variables when assessing the economic viability of any shale gas reservoir is the volume of hydrocarbons-in-place. It is the foundation for the determination of reserves specifically in low permeability reservoirs where flow is in transient regime for very long periods of time, sometimes months or even years (Ibrahim and Wattenbarger, 2006, Ambrose et al., 2011). Since production involves transient flow for such long periods, it is critical to have a best estimate of the resource -both liquid and gaseous phase hydrocarbons in-place- so that the uncertainties can be alleviated during the reserve estimation.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has discovered nanopores in organic-rich shale with sizes typically in 3-100 nm range, although pores less than 3 nm cannot be captured with current SEM technology. At that scale the adsorption layer thickness is not infinitesimally small. Thus a portion of the total pore volume would be occupied by a finite-size adsorption layer and not available for the free gas molecules. In SPE 131772, we proposed a volumetric method which accounts for the volumes taken up by the free gas and by the adsorption layer. The study was based on a single-component Langmuir adsorption model, however. This paper extends the discussions on the adsorption layer effect for multi-component natural gases with a sorption model also known as extended-Langmuir.  We combine the extended-Langmuir adsorption isotherm with volumetrics and free gas composition to formulate a new gas-in-place equation accounting for the pore space taken up by a multi-component sorbed phase. The method yields total gas-in-place predictions, which suggest that an adjustment is necessary in volume calculations, especially for gas shales with high C2+ composition and high in total organic content. Using typical values for the parameters, calculations show a 20% decrease in total gas storage capacity compared to that using the conventional approach. The adjustments need to be done on the free gas volume is 18% more than the value using single-component (methane) case. The role of multi-component adsorption is more important than previously thought. The new methodology is therefore recommended for shale gas-in-place calculations.  Introduction Production from organic rich shales has increased steadily over the last decade and now makes up a large portion of the natural gas production in North America. Productive shale resources now include the Barnett, Woodford, Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Marcellus, to name a few. Interestingly, the recent product price differential between condensate/natural gas liquids and natural gas has shifted the production within these large plays to the more \"liquids-rich?? portions. This has occurred in the Barnett, Eagle Ford and Marcellus specifically. The liquids-rich portions of these plays offer improved well economics due to increased condensate and natural gas liquids production which yield higher pricing on an energy equivalent basis.  One of the primary concerns in any reservoir is the hydrocarbon in place. It is the foundation for the determination of reserves specifically in reservoirs with low permeability. In reservoirs with low permeability the wells are in transient flow for very long periods of time, sometimes months or even years (Ibrahim and Wattenbarger, 2006, Ambrose et al., 2011). Since the wells are in transient flow for such long periods, it is critical to have the best estimate of the resource in place.Having the best estimate for the resource in place can help to alleviate issues related to uncertainties in reserves.

                    "abstract": "Unlike other thermal recovery methods, air injection and in-situ combustion generates significant amounts of heat in the reservoir. However, the process is subject to acute heat loss rates from the reaction zones because of high temperature gradients; consequently, the reaction temperatures may be reduced considerably, leading to a deteriorated combustion performance and debilitated field operations. The goal of this paper is to determine under which reservoir conditions the combustion temperatures could be maintained at sufficient levels. Previous investigators have partially addressed this issue using kinetic and combustion tube experiments. In the absence of heat losses, it has been repeatedly shown that catalytic agents (naturally occurring clays, metal oxides, and some water-soluble metallic additives) improve the self-sustainability limit of combustion front in crude oil and sand mixtures. In general, this has been attributed to the dual role of these agents on the combustion performance, namely the catalytic and fuel deposition effects. It is currently a common belief that appropriate introduction of such materials in a reservoir environment could enhance the performance of combustion process and, hence, improve the recoveries. An investigation of their dual role on combustion requires that the mechanisms of combustion are well understood in their presence. Complex physical and chemical nature of the problem at the pore-scale has prevented detailed investigations using physical and numerical models, however. Here, we approach the problem analytically using a sequential-reaction [high-temperature oxidation/low-temperature oxidation (HTO/LTO)] combustion front propagation model, based on large activation energy asymptotics, and introducing the reaction kinetics and fuel deposition effects to the model systematically by varying the related variables and parameters. Coherent propagation of the reaction regions are then investigated using reaction region temperatures, propagation velocity, and the oxygen consumption efficiency. General characteristics of an ideal catalytic agent are discussed in terms of its potential to improve in-situ combustion. It is found that the front propagation can be improved under the reservoir conditions only if both the catalytic and fuel deposition effects of the agents are present. The work is important for our understanding of in-situ combustion processes and can be used for development of screening criteria to identify high-performance catalytic agents in the laboratory using conventional apparatus.

                    "abstract": "Using FIB/SEM imaging technology, a series of 2-D and 3-D submicro-scale investigations are performed on the types of porous constituents inherent to gas shale. A finely-dispersed porous organic (kerogen) material is observed imbedded within an inorganic matrix. The latter may contain larger-size pores of varying geometries although it is the organic material that makes up the majority of gas pore volume, with pores and capillaries having characteristic lengths typically less than 100 nanometers. A significant portion of total gas in-place appears to be associated with inter-connected large nano-pores within the organic material. This observation has several implications on reservoir engineering of gas shales. Primarily, thermodynamics (phase behavior) of fluids in these pores are known to be quite different. Most importantly, gas residing in a small pore or capillary is rarefied under the influence of organic pore walls and shows a density profile across the pore with damped-oscillations. This raises the following serious questions related to gas-in-place calculations: under reservoir conditions, what fraction of the pore volume of the organic material can be considered available for the free gas phase and what fraction is taken up by the adsorbed phase? If a significant fraction of the organic pore volume is taken up by the adsorbed phase, how accurately is the shale gas storage capacity estimated using the conventional volumetric methods? And, finally, do average densities exist for the free and the adsorbed phases and how large would a typical density contrast be in an organic pore for an accurate gas reserve calculation? In order to answer these questions we combine the Langmuir equilibrium adsorption isotherm with the volumetrics for free gas and formulate a new gas-in-place equation accounting for the organic pore space taken up by the sorbed phase. The method yields a total gas-in-place prediction based on a corrected free gas pore volume that is obtained using an average adsorbed gas density. Next, we address the fundamental-level questions related to phase transition in organic matter using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations involving methane in small carbon slit-pores of varying size and temperature. We predict methane density profiles across the pores and show that (i) an average total thickness for an adsorbed methane layer is typically 0.7 nm, which is roughly equivalent to 4% of a 100 nm diameter pore volume, and (ii) the adsorbed phase density is 1.8-2.0 times larger than that of the bulk methane, i.e., in the absence of pore wall effects. These findings suggest that a significant level of adjustment is necessary in volume calculations, especially for gas shales high in total organic content. Finally, using typical values for the parameters, we perform a series of calculations using the new volumetric method and show a 10-25% decrease in total gas storage capacity compared to that using the conventional approach. This additionally could have a larger impact in shales where the sorbed gas phase is a more significant portion of the total gas-in-place. The new methodology is recommended for estimating shale gas-in-place and the approach could be extended to other unconventional gas-in-place calculations where both sorbed and free gas phases are present.

                    "abstract": "Shale reservoirs have a significant fraction of total pore volume coming from pore sizes in the range of nanometers. Fluid phase behavior in these small pores deviates from the behavior in larger pores (known as bulk PVT). Modifications to thermodynamic modeling coupled with capillary pressure, interfacial tension, and relative permeability are used to analyze the impact of the aforementioned phenomena on hydrocarbon production of liquids-rich shale reservoirs. Furthermore, the impact of rock properties on production performance has to be assessed. Therefore, this paper aims to research the fluid-rock interactions developed within nanoscale reservoirs and their influence on recovery of gas and liquids. We analyzed the phase behavior in nanopores using two approaches: (i) critical properties shift, and (ii) capillary pressure. Reservoir simulation is selected to evaluate these two mechanisms. To attain this goal three cases are constructed, all with constant reservoir porosity, using an in-house compositional simulator: (i) constant permeability reservoir with both bulk and confined fluid properties, (ii) variable permeability reservoir with bulk fluid properties, and (iii) variable permeability reservoir with confined fluid properties. The first case exclusively evaluates the effects of confined vs. bulk fluid properties, the second case only focuses on rock properties changes, whereas the third case studies rock-fluid interactions. For the heterogeneous cases, published pore sizes reported for shale formations are used. Consistency between pore size, porosity and permeability is maintained within the simulation models. Simulation results indicate confinement affects volumetric fluid and transport properties within shales. Significant changes in saturation pressures, which impact relative permeabilities, are manifested with respect to bulk conditions. Comparison of the simulation results allows identification of the contributions of both rock and fluid properties on hydrocarbon recovery. PVT behavior under confinement impacts incremental production during depletion. The methodology introduced in this study is a powerful practical tool for describing rock-fluid interactions in liquids-rich shale reservoirs and helps to understand the shales’ production behavior observed in the field. Detailed comparisons with a gas condensate and a volatile oil reservoir fluids are presented in detail. The physics-based approach implemented in this work provides a novel and important foundation for the analysis of production from confined porous media such as shale reservoirs. Phase behavior in these types of reservoirs is corrected to account for confinement effects in a thermodynamically consistent way to achieve a more accurate performance prediction of nano-porous formations. The modeling developed in this paper is simple, yet robust, as opposed to computationally expensive molecular simulations. The main advantage of the proposed methodologies is that they can be easily implemented into other in-house or commercial simulators. "

Numerical uniaxial strain tests are used to predict porosity and permeability reduction caused by reservoir compaction. Grain crushing incurs a significant reduction of porosity under the uniaxial strain stress path, which becomes more evident for digital samples consisting of larger grains. The stress-dependent changes in porosity and permeability obtained from the DEM simulations can be used as inputs for a reservoir-scale correlation to predict the productivity loss due to reservoir compaction.

Reservoir performance and pressure characterization in multi-stage fracture development considering elastic rock mechanics are not systematically discussed in the literature. This work considers effects of elastic rock mechanics and hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoir development scenarios using a numerical model with coupled fluid flow and geomechanics. A fully coupled flow and geomechanics model based on finite element method is introduced to analyze shale gas flow and corresponding pressure distribution in unconventional reservoirs. The model is validated with an analytical solution and history matched with field data. Furthermore, effects of rock mechanics, elastic properties, and hydraulic fracture geometry on reservoir performance and pressure distribution are studied using the fully coupled numerical model. Pressure distribution and reservoir performance in terms of production rates of these scenarios are analyzed. It is found that consideration of elastic rock mechanics decreases the hydrocarbon production rates and alters the pressure distribution in the unconventional reservoir. Rock mechanical properties and fracture spacing/length also affect flow rates and pressure. Fracture spacing, fracture length, and Young's modulus have the greatest effect on hydrocarbon production rates. Effects of elastic rock mechanics are most significant at central areas of the fractured region, while such effects are less significant at far ends of the horizontal wellbore. This work incorporates full geomechanics with a flow model to understand reservoir performance and pressure characterization in multi-stage hydraulic fracture development scenarios and quantifies effects of geomechanics and effects of various parameters in unconventional development scenarios.

However, the coupled model of large-scale simulation problems usually encounters large matrix system and high computational expenses, where the time stepping is a crucial factor for numerical stability and computational efficiency. Here, we report an adaptive time stepping with the modified local error method to reduce iteration time and improve the computational efficiency for the coupled flow-geomechanics modeling. Firstly, the iterative coupling approach with the fixed-stress method is introduced, where the flow and geomechanics equations are sequentially solved at each time step. Secondly, since updating geomechanics module consumes most of the computing time of the coupled system, the modified local error method is mainly used for geomechanics module to adapt the time step size based on the change of displacement. Finally, a synthetic two-dimensional coupled problem is established to apply the proposed adaptive time stepping approach, where the numerical results including the computational efficiency are compared with the results from regular iteratively coupled method and the fully coupled model. The sensitivity about the local error tolerance on the numerical results is also investigated. The geomechanical responses regarding mechanical loading is validated by comparing with the analytical solution of Terzaghi's consolidation problem. The numerical results of the two-dimensional coupled model show the modified local error method not only yields a higher-order solution for better accuracy, but also significantly reduces the iteration number and computational time.

Multiple non-Darcy flow mechanisms in the shale matrix further bring challenges for modeling. In this paper, we developed a framework combining a multi-physics compositional simulator with Multi-Porosity Modeling preprocessor for gas storage and transport in shale. A Triple-Porosity Model is used to characterize the three porosity systems in shale gas reservoirs. In the fracture porosity the heterogeneous impact of secondary fractures distribution on matrix-to-fracture fluid transfer is revealed by shape factor distribution. They are upscaled with superior accuracy from a detailed Discrete Fracture Network Model (DFN) sector model, where orthogonal hydraulic fractures are explicitly discretized. With the occurrence of nano-pores in shale matrix, the interaction between pore-wall and gas molecules is considered via Knudsen diffusion and gas slippage. Gas adsorption on the pore-wall of organic matrix is modeled by extended Langmuir isotherm. The inter-porosity and intra-porosity connectivities in the Triple-Porosity Model are flexibly controlled by arbitrary connections. Our results show that gas production in the Triple-Porosity Model with shape factor upscaled from DFN exhibits different production performance from models with uniform shape factor distribution. The deviations are caused by the dominance of different regions at different production periods. Connection topology in the shale gas reservoir is also comprehensively assessed. We demonstrate that the intra-porosity connections in the inorganic and organic matrix have negligible impact on the global gas flux, while the inter-porosity connections have different levels of importance for the gas production. Moreover, different combinations of flow and storage mechanisms are investigated. We show that Langmuir desorption maintains reservoir pressure, but gas slippage and Knudsen diffusion accelerate the pressure drop. Both mechanisms contribute to improve the gas production and the consideration of them simultaneously improve gas production most. "

                    "abstract": "In this study, we established a more efficient approach for fractured shale reservoir modeling with an emphasis on simplifying and automating the workflow for assisted history matching and uncertainty quantification. The improvement is especially notable for the process of history matching since the fracture geometry and properties can be directly set as parameters to be history matched. The resultant approach not only shows a significant reduction in the computational time while maintaining model accuracy, but also provides an automatic method for modifying the fracture related parameters - a laborious process in the traditional workflow. In the forward reservoir model, we implemented and extended the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (Embedded DFM) approach for fractures with arbitrary strike and dip angle to a multiple porosity/permeability setting. The fractures are naturally discretized by the boundary of parent matrix grid blocks. Control volumes of fracture segments are generated according to the specific geometry of each of the segments. Three types of non-neighbor connections are then generated, namely the connection between the fracture segment and its parent matrix grid blocks, the connection between two intersecting fracture segments from different fractures, and the connection between two neighbor fracture segments from the same fracture. For each of the non-neighbor connections, transmissibility can be calculated honoring the physics of the flow. In our approach with Embedded Discrete Fracture Multiple-Porosity Model, the matrix is sub-divided into three porosity types, namely organic matrix (kerogen), inorganic matrix and natural fractures, with the necessary physics included for each of the porosity types. The macro fractures are explicitly represented with Embedded DFM. The proposed model provides a coherent method for characterizing the organic matrix, inorganic matrix, micro fractures as well as the hydraulic fractures of shale reservoirs. It offers a computationally efficient approach for modeling the severe heterogeneity due to hydraulic and natural fractures. Compared with traditional discrete fracture models, fewer grid blocks and lower levels of refinement are required. Compared with multiple porosity method, the proposed model has desirable accuracy for the simulation of reservoirs with large scale fractures. In the history matching and uncertainty quantification stage, due to the low efficiency of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method when applied to reservoir history matching, a more advanced algorithm of two-stage MCMC is employed to evaluate the uncertainty for all the parameters. Since no upscaling of the fracture related parameters is required, the reservoir model can be generated by a pre-processor based on the proposed parameter, which maintains the adequacy of a Gaussian distribution assumption. Therefore, the workflow can be completely automated. By incorporating Embedded DFM and multiple porosity/permeability approaches, the improved model facilitates the history matching of fractured shale reservoirs by cutting the total amount of grid blocks, reducing the complexity of the gridding process, as well as improving the accuracy of fluid transportation within and among different porosity types.

Discretization process of the mathematical model is greatly simplified by three differential operators that are defined to represent the expressions of divergence, gradient and average as their original forms, and thus, enable rapid prototyping of the numerical model. The discretized equation system is solved by a modified Newton's method, in which the Jacobian matrix is computed by the automatic differentiation (AD) technique. Our model is validated with the simulation results obtained by the commercial reservoir simulator, Eclipse. To test the model's potential in field-scale application, we implement it in five large-scale complex fractured systems that are radial domains with a uniform diameter of 1000 m but different fracture densities: 382/km2, 509/km2, 636/km2, 764/km2 and 1018/km2. Simulation results not only indicate the robustness of our model in simulating complex fractured systems but also highlight the significant effects of fracture network configuration and fracture density on the development features of fractured tight oil reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "Compositional simulation is often required for modeling complex oil recovery processes, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (Chen and Reynolds, 2016, Dai et al., 2014). Flash calculation using Equation of State (EOS) is very CPU expensive in compositional simulation. Conventional approaches for initial guess of K-values usually have several levels of limitations. This paper reports our research motivated to provide trustworthy initial guess for flash calculation and further improve flash performance in isothermal processes. Reservoir fluid composition changes are categorized into two different scenarios: (a) slightly varying or constant composition changes in depletion process; and (b) sharp varying composition in gas injection process. Scenario (a) is reasonably parameterized as a compositional space of K-value and vapor mole fraction varied with pressure. Considering the actual simulation of gas injection process, a compositional space is defined via introducing a key pseudo composition as a controlling variable in addition to pressure. Flash calculation is formulated through direct solution of those non-linear equations in phase-split calculation, and solved by combining successive substitution iteration (SSI) and Newton-Raphson (NR) method. Using interpolation from the constructed compositional space, it is found that the initial guess of K-values for flash calculation are always obtained with safeguard. A variety of fluid samples has been applied for testing this new flash technique. The results show that initial guesses of K-values based on Wilson’s correlation results cause much more flash iterations and even failures in some gas injection examples. On the other hand, the proposed method shows significant advantages in reducing the number of flash iterations in all examples. In addition, the SSI procedure in flash can even be bypassed and only NR procedure and a simple Rachford-Rice Equation Preconditioning is sufficient. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading is a challenging issue in most mature gas fields. The dynamic interaction between wellbore and reservoir when liquid loading happens cannot be comprehensively simulated by a single wellbore simulator or a single reservoir simulator. In this paper, we developed a fully implicitly coupled wellbore/reservoir model to predict the onset of liquid loading and simulate the subsequent unstable production period. We fully couple a multi-segment well model with an in-house compositional reservoir simulator based on the control-volume finite-difference method. Transient material balance and mixture momentum balance are solved simultaneously with the reservoir system to obtain pressure, mixture velocity, and phase holdup in each wellbore segment. We further proposed a drift-flux model that is able to predict the transitions from stable flow patterns to unstable patterns for different pipe inclinations from vertical to horizontal. The model is applied in the coupled wellbore-reservoir simulator to characterize the two-phase flow in horizontal wellbores. We validate the coupled wellbore-reservoir model with a numerical reservoir simulator and demonstrate the model capability in simulating the whole producing life of liquid-loaded horizontal gas wells. The parametric study indicates that wellbore perforation numbers and joint pipe length before the first perforation can influence the onset time of liquid loading and the duration of unstable production. Most of previous studies focus on predicting the onset of liquid loading phenomenon. In this paper, our model first achieves the analysis of the unstable production period after liquid loading occurs. The detection of unstable production can be much straightforward comparing to the onset of liquid loading, which makes the model a promising tool in assisting the decision of deliquification strategies for field operators.

                    "abstract": "Natural fractures have been widely found and thought to be an important factor in creating a complex hydraulic fractures network and improving hydrocarbon production in shale reservoirs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is extensively applied to measure in-situ petrophysical properties, and magnetic nanoparticles provide good contrast agents to distinguish hydrogen relaxation time for NMR. The objective of this paper was to estimate spatial distribution of natural fractures in shale gas reservoirs by applying magnetic nanoparticles to change the NMR relaxation times. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3D) reservoir model including multiple natural fractures was built to investigate the flow of nanoparticles and the distribution of volume magnetic susceptibility (VMS) when injecting magnetic nanoparticles. The sensitivity analyses about nanoparticle concentration and nanoparticles size were investigated. Secondly, a forward model was introduced about how to obtain Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo decay trains from given relaxation times. Thirdly, an inversion method was presented to convert the typical CPMG echo decay curve into the distribution of T2 relaxation amplitudes and times. The inversion method was used to show the change of T2 amplitude and time for the two synthetic cases with and without magnetic nanoparticles. The dynamic distribution of nanoparticles concentration and VMS are graphically displayed along each time step in 3D mesh. The results show that magnetic nanoparticles bring much larger VMS while most nanoparticles only flow into these natural fractures (NF) directly connected with wellbore. The others’ NF have somewhat higher VMS than matrix. Additionally, based on various sensitivity cases, a higher concentration of nanoparticles yields a stronger magnetic field, and larger nanoparticle size could lead to higher VMS, although the nanoparticles face stronger flow resistance and less diffusion movement. The CPMG decay curve is a multi-dimensional exponential function related to relaxation amplitudes and times, and the least squares minimization technique can be applied to obtain the T2 amplitudes from CPMG curve. The comparison between two synthetic cases shows the amplitude for small T2 time increases and the amplitude for large T2 time reduces, which provides a clear indicator to detect the locations of natural fractures because their T2 largely reduce. The nanoparticle model provides valuable guidance about choosing parameters for optimizing magnetic nanoparticle injection design to enhance VMS and NMR signals. The inversion model introduces an efficient path for estimating T2 distribution and petrophysical properties from the acquired NMR CPMG signals. Additionally, magnetic Nanoparticles provide excellent relaxation contrasts to distinguish the magnetization signals of formation for estimating the spatial natural fractures distribution. Consequently, in-situ fracture characterization and the development of hydraulic fracture treatments could be beneficially improved. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture-density evaluation has always been challenging for the petroleum industry, although it is a required characteristic for reliable reservoir characterization. Production can be directly controlled by fracture density, especially in tight reservoirs. Previous publications showed that use of high thermal neutron-capture cross-sectional (HTNCC) contrast agents can enhance the sensitivity of neutron logs to the presence of fractures. However, all these studies focus on locating the proppants. In this paper, we introduce a method of injecting electrically transported charged boron carbide (B4C) contrast agents to naturally fractured formations to enhance the propagation of the contrast agents into the secondary-fracture (natural and induced) network by use of an externally applied electric field and to characterize the fracture density in the unpropped region by use of the enhanced neutron porosity logs. We perform numerical simulations to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. A physical model derived from electrophoretic velocity and material-balance formulations is proposed and solved to simulate the spatial distribution of contrast agents. Furthermore, we simulate neutron porosity logs by solving the neutron-diffusion equation, which allows a fast analysis for the proposed technique. The simulation results confirmed that an external electric field can significantly enhance the transport of charged contrast agents into the secondary-fracture network. Sensitivity analysis revealed that increasing particle f-potential can efficiently decrease the transport time. Furthermore, we applied the introduced technique on synthetic cases with variable secondary-fracture density ranging from 1 to 8%. The relative variation in the simulated neutron porosity before and after applying the electric potential field was up to 50% in a formation with 8% fracture density after applying an electric field for 6 hours. The proposed technique can potentially enable application of neutron porosity logs in fracture characterization, including assessment of secondary-fracture density, if combined with other well logs.

The purpose of this approach is to efficiently represent complex fracture network and accurately simulate the fluid exchange between matrix and fracture. In this approach, fracture network is discretized with a minimum number of grids depending on the fracture intersecting points and fracture extremities. Besides, fracture network naturally decomposes matrix into coarse-scale block with variable geometries, and the partition is optimized by a rapid image processing algorithm. Each coarse matrix block is locally associated with a fracture grid, and it is equivalently discretized to rectangular fine-scale grid blocks. Fine-scale grid blocks are communicated with local fracture grids through one-dimensional flow transport. Therefore, the EDFN model maximally optimizes the discretization process for fractured reservoirs, and it is very appropriate for the simulation of reservoirs with arbitrarily oriented interconnected fractures. Through benchmark with different grid discretization approaches, the EDFN model provides very consistent results and its accuracy is validated. Besides, we also demonstrate that the EDFN model is able to simulate fractured reservoirs with a much smaller number of grid blocks than other approaches. Finally different non-Darcy flow mechanisms in shale gas reservoirs are incorporated into the EDFN model and the impact of those flow mechanisms are investigated. "

                    "abstract": "During reservoir depletion, effective stress is increased and permeability is reduced, while the organic- rich matrix might experience a shrinkage process that will boost the permeability. The main objective was to develop a mathematical simulator coupling gas flow process, geomechanics effects, and matrix shrinkage in order to evaluate their influences on reservoir permeability and production performance. The mesh was divided into three different continuums: organic matter, inorganic matter, and natural fractures. Matrix shrinkage was only considered for organic matter because of gas desorption, and the stress- dependent permeability was considered for both inorganic matter and natural fractures. The flow and stress-equilibrium equations were solved by the fixed-stress sequential method, where the flow equations are solved first, followed by the mechanics equations. The displacements are solved for each grid node by finite element method, and the pressure is solved by the integral finite difference method. Different stress- dependent correlations are chosen to separately apply to the three porous media. Based on those correlations, the porosity and permeability are updated at end of each time step. A synthetic reservoir model was built, where the permeability change and the accumulative gas production is calculated at each time step. The results of permeability change and gas production rate are compared for three different cases: the coupled flow and geomechanics model without permeability change, the coupled model considering stress-dependent permeability, the coupled model considering both matrix shrinkage and permeability change. Additionally, the sensitivity analyses were investigated for total organic carbon (TOC), Young's modulus, matrix permeability, and bottom hole pressure. Results show that the stress-dependent permeability plays a large influence on the gas production performance, because permeability could be significantly reduced with the decrease of reservoir pressure. The matrix shrinkage on organic matter could provide an obvious rebound on accumulative production at the late producing stage, because the permeability is boosted by that media shrinkage at the late producing stage. That explains why permeability largely decreases at early stage and then gradually reduces in experimental data. However, the permeability and production loss are highly depended on the selected correlation, its coefficients, reservoir initial condition, and rock properties. Organic matter is the critical controller on matrix shrinkage: the higher the TOC, the larger the increase of permeability. Nevertheless, their overall impacts on production is quite limited. Young's modulus does not make obvious differences on the accumulative gas based on the numerical results. The large matrix permeability and higher bottom hole pressure can reduce the production loss caused by the effect of stress-dependent permeability. Overall, the triple-porosity coupled simulator can quantitatively interpret the impacts of matrix shrinkage and geomechanics effect on permeability and gas production performance for organic-rich shale reservoirs. This provides more realistic production performance evaluation and economic assessment when the stress-dependent permeability needs to be considered. "

                    "abstract": "The coupled flow-geomechanics model is required to investigate the stress change, rock-compaction behavior, and stress-dependent properties in many reservoir scenarios. However, the coupled model for large-scale or three-dimensional simulation problems usually encounters large matrix system and high computation expenses, where the time stepping is a crucial factor for numerical stability and computational efficiency. In this paper, an adaptive time stepping with the modified local error method was presented to reduce iteration time and improve the computation efficiency for the coupled flow-geomechanics modeling. Firstly, the iterative coupling approach with the fixed-stress method was introduced, where the flow and geomechanics equations are sequentially solved at each time step. Secondly, due to updating geomechanics module consumes the major computing time for the coupled problems, the modified local error method was mainly used for geomechanics module, where fewer geomechanics time steps are needed after implementation. Specifically, the geomechanics module will be updated until a given local error of displacement is reached, and the time step size will be automatically adapted based on the change of displacement, which is more efficient than the constant time step method. Finally, a synthetic two-dimensional coupled production problem is established to apply the proposed adaptive time stepping approach, where the numerical results including the computing efficiency are compared with the results from regular sequential method and the fully coupled model. The sensitivity about the local error tolerance was also investigated. The geomechanical responses regarding mechanical loading is validated by comparing with the analytical solution of Terzaghi's consolidation problem. The numerical results about the pressure and displacement change on the two-dimensional coupled model are compared with the results from the regular sequential method and the fully-coupled method. The modified local error method, which adjusts time step size for both flow and geomechanics module, not only yields a higher-order solution for better accuracy, but also significantly reduces the iteration number and computation time, especially for the cases with low truncation error requirement. The error tolerance of displacement is critical on when the step size will be adapted. Small error tolerance can maintain the accuracy while it needs more iteration computing. The strategy about how to modify step size plays an important role in the stability and computing efficiency for the modified local error method. A large increase or cut on one-step size could bring the oscillation results. Overall, the adaptive time stepping approach can both effectively reduce total computation time and simultaneously maintain the accuracy for the coupled flow-geomechanics problems. It is useful for large-scale or three-dimensional coupled problems, where the high computational efficiency is required. "

With current computing capabilities, conventional fine-scale single-porosity models are not practical for large-scale reservoir simulation. A multi-continuum reservoir model is presented as an effective approach to modeling fractured vuggy reservoirs on the coarse scale. This model consists of four different porosity systems, i.e. the matrix, fractures, isolated vugs and connected vugs. This study investigates mass exchange between different porosity systems with the final objective of developing new transfer functions that can be used as an application to upscaling fractured vuggy reservoir models. A well-designed procedure is proposed to obtain the novel transfer functions in multi-continuum fractured vuggy reservoir models. Different realizations of the vug-filled matrix blocks are generated to show the effect of vug fraction, distribution and connectivity on multi-phase fluid flow. For interporosity flow between vugs and the other two media, new formulations of the shape factors that incorporate the effect of vug spatial variation are developed respectively. The dominant mechanisms of multiphase fluid exchange between each two porosity systems (matrix-isolated vugs, fractures-connected vugs) are discussed separately. New transfer functions for multiphase flow in the multi-continuum fractured vuggy model to capture the complex flow mechanisms and emulate the results of the fine-grid model are provided. In addition, a transmissibility multiplier table is introduced as another connection term for the transfer functions to improve the accuracy of upscaling solution. Finally, a new upscaling approach by incorporating the proposed transfer functions into multi-continuum models is presented. This paper provides a new insight to the complex fluid exchange among three different media in fractured vuggy reservoirs. Results show that the new upscaling methodology helps to reduce the size of simulation model and improve the computational speed significantly, while providing an accurate representation of the fine-scale results.

We realize that there are two issues related to the compositional simulation of production in tight oil reservoirs. Firstly, tight oil reservoirs typically exhibit extremely small matrix pore size in the order of nanometers, so the capillary pressure between vapor and liquid phases is considerable such that the PVT of the confined fluid deviates from that of the bulk fluid with capillary pressure ignored. Secondly, during depletion process, rock compaction causes pore space reduction and brings remarkable changes in rock properties. In this work we implement rigorous confined fluid phase behavior calculation depending on capillary pressure and rock compaction in a fully compositional simulator. Capillary pressure in matrix nanopores is calculated by Leverett J-function. Further, the impact of capillarity on phase equilibrium is taken into account through modifying the stability test and two-phase flash calculation. Dynamic rock compaction is considered in the simulator via rock compaction tables, such that fluid mobility decreases with permeability reduction and capillary effect is simultaneously coupled. The unique implementation in the simulator captures the dynamic behavior of rock and fluid properties in tight oil reservoirs. Typical suppression of bubble point pressure and reduction of oil viscosity and density is observed from our simulation results. Reservoir-scale simulation results show that this model resolves the problem of the inconsistent GOR in tight oil production and greatly facilitates the history matching process. The enhanced compositional simulation will ultimately improve our understanding of tight oil reservoirs and provide better guidance for recovery prediction. "

In this paper, we developed a framework combining a multi-physics compositional simulator with Multi-Porosity Modeling preprocessor for gas storage and transport in shale. A Triple-Porosity Model is used to characterize the three porosity systems in shale gas reservoirs. In the fracture porosity the heterogeneous impact of secondary fractures distribution on matrix-to-fracture fluid transfer is revealed by shape factor distribution. They are upscaled with superior accuracy from a detailed Discrete Fracture Network Model (DFN) sector model, where orthogonal hydraulic fractures are explicitly discretized. With the occurrence of nano-pores in shale matrix, the interaction between pore-wall and gas molecules is considered via Knudsen diffusion and gas slippage. Gas adsorption on the pore-wall of organic matrix is modeled by extended Langmuir isotherm. The inter-porosity and intra-porosity connectivities in the Triple-Porosity Model are flexibly controlled by arbitrary connections. Our results show that gas production in the Triple-Porosity Model with shape factor upscaled from DFN exhibits different production performance from models with uniform shape factor distribution. The deviations are caused by the dominance of different regions at different production periods. Moreover, different combinations of flow and storage mechanisms are investigated. We show that Langmuir desorption maintains reservoir pressure, but gas slippage and Knudsen diffusion accelerate the pressure drop. Both mechanisms contribute to improve the gas production and the consideration of them simultaneously improve gas production most. "

                    "abstract": "We propose a robust multiple permeability model to account for pore size variability and filtration effects in shale reservoirs and to explain the behavior of unconventional resources such as anomalous gas oil ratios. Recent developments in technology transformed unconventional low-permeability shales into reliable energy sources. With regard to capacity, unconventional resources are found to be more abundant than conventional ones. These resources have opened new challenges and technical difficulties along with enhanced capacities. Recent advances in high precision analytical tools have revealed that pore size distribution in shale reservoirs cover a wide range. Molecules in pores with different sizes may exhibit significantly different thermodynamic behavior. Rock fluid interactions and space hindrance effects play an important role when pore sizes become close to species' molecular dimeters. This effect can result in a composition difference between pores with large and small diameters in shale reservoirs (sieving effect), with small pores mostly filled with smaller hydrocarbon molecules and large molecules residing in larger pores. To account for such a diverse behavior, this paper proposes a multiple permeability model, which divides shale media into three different permeability/porosity systems: fracture, matrix with large pores and matrix with small pores. We use a modified version of the Peng Robinson equation of state to model the equilibrium hydrocarbon distribution in large and small pores. Our thermodynamics calculations show that as pore dimeter decreases, the concentration of larger hydrocarbon molecules in those pores decreases because of size filtration. A synthetic reservoir model is used along with the multiple permeability model to analyze reservoir production behavior at different conditions. The so-called sieving effect is believed to be responsible for the anomalous production behavior (lower-than-expected or constant gas oil ratios for extended production periods). Our model is then applied to a real Eagle Ford case to history-match production data with the stimulated reservoir volume built upon the fracture microseismic data. The results show that our multiple permeability model provides a powerful tool to evaluate the complicated flow dynamics in liquid shales. "

We primarily implement MPI for matrix assembly and parallel solvers, particularly using the PETSc library codes while using OpenMP for other miscellaneous subroutines to prevent significant overheads. We also study different matrix decomposition schemes for the geomechanics linear system, which not only precondition for parallel solvers but also assign computation loads to cores involved in the cluster. We take more than one million cells to investigate parallel performance. For both flow and geomechanics, the parallelization largely reduces the overall simulation execution time and obtains scalable speedups. Parallel-solver-only performance is tested as well. We find that solver performance achieves scalable speedups, where the optimum overall speedup for the parallel coupled simulator exceeds 14. Also, matrix decomposition methods have effects on parallelization in terms of execution time and solver performance, implying that the selection of matrix decomposition methods is important for high efficiency parallelization. The parallel scheme in this study can straightforwardly be applied to other sequentially coupled simulators, without significant code development. When the flow and geomechanics simulators are sequentially coupled, we find that the scalability of the parallel coupled simulator can be honored. We also find that plasticity can lead to imbalance in the parallel environment. Thus, efficient parallel schemes for plasticity are required. "

In our approach, only the matrix boundaries and fractures are discretized into small elements, and each element associates with either one or two unknowns. Two sets of equations generated from the above two simplifications are used to relate these unknowns and solve the problem.

                    "abstract": "The wide implementation of hydraulic fracturing in shale reservoirs and the interactions among hydraulic fractures, natural fractures and the shale matrix have brought great challenge for reservoir studies using conventional finite-difference-based reservoir simulators. This work establishes a dynamic approach for the simulation of fractured shale reservoirs that incorporate the embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) as well as the multiple porosity model, which is necessary for simulating the complex transportation process in shale reservoirs. In this paper, we extend the EDFM approach for fractured shale reservoirs to a multi-continuum context, in which one fracture segment can have mass transfer with multiple parent grid blocks in favor of the complex porosity types of shale formations. The reservoir model can be updated dynamically during the simulation with our in-house simulator to consider the change of the fracture network due to fracking and refracking at different stages of field development. This is achieved by altering the effective non-neighbor connections with time that are associated with the fracture system. Therefore the reservoir with a changing fracture distribution can be modeled with a single simulation. The formulation is based on finite volume rather than finite difference to facilitate the unstructured nature of the reservoir model. The result is compared with the explicit fracture model with PEBI grid blocks to evaluate its accuracy. For the test case of a horizontal well with multiple hydraulic fractures and large scale natural fractures, the simulation result can be matched with great accuracy. Sensitivity analysis to grid refinement is also conducted, which proves the model only need moderate grid refinement to obtain desirable accuracy. This work established a more flexible and efficient yet more accurate approach for fractured shale reservoir modeling, with the emphasis on improving the ability to model the fluid transportation among different porosity types. The proposed model improves the simulation by reducing the complexity of the gridding process, cutting the total number of grid blocks, and significantly decreasing the CPU time. It provides a coherent method for characterizing the fluid transportation in fractured shale reservoirs, which is usually a difficult task with traditional reservoir models. "

                    "abstract": "Horizontal well drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing are two main technologies in the development of shale gas reservoirs. In this study, a multi-scale percolation mathematical model for the shale gas reservoirs was established based on the discrete fracture network (DFN) model and the derived nonlinear equations were solved based on the Newton-Raphson method through programming in C Sharp. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation was conducted to evaluate the influence of hydraulic fracture stages/spacing, half-length, aperture, orientation and natural & hydraulic fracture connectivity on the shale gas exploitation in a basic geological model with complex natural fractures network. Numerical simulation results indicate that the hydraulic fracture stages/spacing, half-length and orientation only influence the early period (the first 100 day in this model) production rate which becomes consistent after that, but the fracture aperture has a little effect because the matrix permeability is the main factor to limit the gas flow. There are a demarcation point that the cumulative production acceleration slows down when the number of hydraulic fracture stage increase (20 stages for this case) and the cumulative production acceleration speed up when the hydraulic fracture half-length increase (45m for this case). The hydraulic fracture aperture has a little effect on the cumulative production when the matrix permeability is 800nD for the presented fractures network in this work. When the angle of natural fractures and horizontal well are 45°, the angle of hydraulic fracture and natural fracture varies between 45° and 75° or the angle of hydraulic fracture and well varies between 90° and 120° is most beneficial to enhance the cumulative production. The cumulative production of shale gas well is positively correlated to the all fracture intersecting node number which is changed by only adjusting the fracture stage (or fracture length, fracture orientation), we also find that the effect of the fracture length change on cumulative production is the most obvious, and the descending order of the fracture parameters is fracture length> fracture stage> fracture orientation.

                    "abstract": "Most of the world's massive fields produce from naturally fractured vuggy carbonate reservoirs. However, modeling such reservoirs is a challenging task due to the co-existence of porous and free-flow domains over a wide range of scales. Realistic characterization of fractured vuggy reservoirs requires preservation of the geological structure and reproduction of patterns. In this study, we model a discrete fracture-vug network using microtomography and multiple-point geostatistics (MPG) modeling technique. For this purpose, micro-CT scan images of a real core is used to generate two micro-scale geological models (2D and 3D reference models, which are used as original training images) with three structures; matrix, fractures, and vugs. The structures in the reference models are also separated into matrix-fracture and matrix-vug to construct two other training images for each of the 2D and 3D original training images. The three training images are then used in MPG to generate multiple equiprobable models that mimic the original networks of the fractures and vugs. The models created using the original training images are called direct models. The others that are generated using the training images after separating the structures (matrix-fracture and matrix-vug), referred to as separable training images, are combined into fracture-vug-matrix models by superimposing the fracture networks from the matrix-fracture models on their corresponding matrix-vug models. These final three-structure models are called the combined models. The spatial continuity, connectivity, patterns reproduction, and flow performance of the generated models are compared with those of the reference models (original training images). The results show that, the separable modeling method produces better results when used in 2D modeling, however, that is not the case for 3D modeling. All the generated realizations preserved the structures and reproduced the spatial continuity of the reference models for 2 and 3D cases. In addition, the patterns are well reproduced in both cases. However, the connectivity and the flow performance of the traditional (direct) MPG method are found to be more accurate in the 3D case than those of the separable MPG method. These results proof that the separable MPG method is not suitable for real 3D naturally fractured vuggy reservoirs modeling applications. However, more detailed sensitivity analysis of the MPG parameters could provide new insights in utilizing this method for 3D reservoir modeling applications. "

                    "abstract": "Flow simulation in carbonate reservoirs presents many challenges due to the frequent occurrence of vugs and natural fractures therein. In conventional reservoir simulation practices, fluid flow in vugs and fractures is usually assumed as Darcy flow, and permeability values are estimated for vuggy regions and fractures. Although such estimations are often accomplished in reasonable ways, no physical or mathematical basis exists for them, and even the assumption of Darcy flow itself is questionable. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow for the simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoirs. The workflow is based on simulation results of a single-phase transient Brinkman model, which provides the correct and complete description of the coupled flow in vuggy and fractured reservoirs by unifying Stokes flow in vugs and fractures with Darcy flow in the rock matrix. The new workflow proceeds through an iterative procedure by increasing the permeability values of vugs and fractures without the disadvantages of accurately estimating them, and attains the final simulation results when a convergence pattern is observed. The novel workflow is implemented and compared with the conventional approaches in commercial reservoir simulators. The workflow is first applied to single-phase flow simulations in a fine-scale 3D geological model which is generated using the multiple-point geostatistical modeling technique, and then extended to immiscible two-phase flow and other multi-phase cases. Simulation results show that in most cases our new workflow yields higher production rate predictions than conventional approaches. This is due to the fact that the permeability values of vugs and fractures estimated by conventional methods are usually lower than the permeability values required for the iterative convergence of the new workflow. The results also have further implications on the history matching process that more focus should be put on fracture geometry, i.e. fracture width and half-length, since the use of fracture permeability alone has lost its physical meaning in the novel workflow according to the Brinkman equation.

                    "abstract": "The exploitation of unconventional reservoirs is increasingly a major source of long-term energy in the word. Research results have revealed that the natural fractures occur in shale gas reservoirs and many shale outcrops, cores, and image logs contain fractures or fracture traces, and microseismic event patterns associated with the hydraulic fracture stimulation have been ascribed to the natural fractures reactivation. Hydraulic fracture treatments also induce complex fracture geometries in naturally fractured shale gas reservoirs. The production performance of shale gas plays denpend strongly on the existence of a dense and conductive network volume of the well. Most of shale gas reservoirs exhibit a higher degree of heterogeneity and complexity created by both natural and hydraulic fractures, whose permeability is stress-dependent. In order to describe the fracturs's seepage characterization explicity, the discrete fracture network (DFN) model is adopted in this research when the conventional continuum model cannot meet the requirements of the fractured shale gas reservoirs numerical simulation. The nonlinear partial differential equations about the seepage flow mathematic model are solved by finite volume method using the C-sharp programming language. The fracture permeability stress-dependent experiments have been conducted on shale core samples, and then the fracture aperture-pressure correlation is combined with the mathematic model of DFN to demonstrate the fracture conductivity potential impact as pressure drops during production. The lab experiment results show that the fracture aperture is strong stress-sensitive at low pressure (0~20MPa). The model is used to do a simulation on a random generated fractures network, which is used to represent the fractured shale gas reservoir, to study the effect of the stress-sensitive on the flow and transport characteristics in the fractured porous media. Results show that: the fracture permeability stress-sensitive has a significant impact on the production and should not be ignored. "

                    "abstract": "Extensive pore-structure studies reveal that the fabric of shale systems are comprised primarily of micro-nano meter matrix pores and complex natural fractures. Measured permeability of shale samples containing natural fractures varies significantly with different cores in the same shale gas reservoir. The significant variation is mainly caused by the stochastic distribution of natural factures. These natural fractures’ effects on permeability under reservoir conditions significantly influence oil and gas production. This work proposes a predictive permeability model that considers the gas transport mechanisms both in the natural factures and matrix pores. In this work, permeability variation is accomplished by considering that the shale core consists of matrix pores and natural fractures. A simple conceptual flow model with shale gas apparent permeability is developed that couples the cubic flow effects of natural fractures and micro- and nano- scale seepage effects of matrix micro- and Nano- pores based on the principle of equivalent flow resistance and the Tandem -Parallel rules of circuit theory. The matrix apparent permeability is derived based on the dusty gas model (DGM) by considering the contribution of Knudsen diffusion and gas slippage. The fracture apparent permeability is established based on a parallel-plate model by considering the influence of the fracture density. Then the comprehensive apparent permeability of shale samples is achieved by coupling the matrix apparent permeability and the natural fractures apparent permeability. The matching results with experiment permeability of the Cambrian Niutitang formation from Sichuan Basin in South China show that the naturally fractured shale permeability is strongly affected by the natural fractures’ characteristic parameters. This research proves that shale measured permeability is the result of seepage interaction between the natural fractures and matrix space. The new permeability model, which overcomes the defect of conventional models that only considered the contribution of the fracture system or the matrix system, can accurately estimate the total contributions of matrix pores and natural fractures. In turn, this will enable engineers to complete the shale gas simulation studies more readily. In the future, this new methodology can be used to develop the next generation reservoir simulators for the shale reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture density evaluation has always been challenging for the petroleum industry, although it is a required characteristic for reliable reservoir characterization. Production can be directly controlled by fracture density, especially in tight reservoirs. Previous publications introduced the method of using high thermal neutron capture cross-section contrast agents like boron carbide (CB4) to enhance the sensitivity of neutron logs to the presence of fractures. However, all of the studies focus on locating the proppants. In this paper, we propose to (a) enhance the propagation of the contrast agents into the secondary (natural and induced) fracture network using an externally applied electric field and (b) characterize the fracture density in un-propped area using the enhanced neutron porosity logs. We perform numerical simulations to validate the feasibility of the proposed technique. A physical model derived from electrophoretic velocity and material balance formulations is proposed and solved to simulate the spatial distribution of contrast agents. Furthermore, we simulate neutron porosity logs by solving the neutron diffusion equation which significantly reduces the computing cost (from hours to a few seconds) compared to conventional use of the MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle Code) technique. The simulation results confirmed that an external electric field can significantly enhance the transport of charged contrast agents into the secondary fracture network. Sensitivity analysis revealed that increasing particle zeta potential can efficiently decrease the transport time. Furthermore, we applied the introduced technique on synthetic cases with variable secondary fracture density ranging from 1% to 8%. The relative change of simulated neutron porosity before and after applying the electric potential field was up to 50% in a formation with 8% fracture density after applying an electric field for 6 hours. The proposed technique can potentially enable application of neutron porosity logs in fracture characterization, including assessment of secondary fracture density, if combined with other well logs.

A two-phase mathematical flow model considering the effect of the threshold pressure gradient (TPG) for gas and water transportation and flow in such reservoirs has been developed. The corresponding numerical model has been formulated and solved. From the numerical results, we can conclude that both the gas production rate and cumulative gas production in the case when TPG is considered are always less than those in the cases when TPG is not considered because of the sharply decreased pressure and increased energy consumption. A comparison of the gas production rates obtained from the calculation results and from monitoring data indicates that the gas production rate predicted using the model with TPG is more accurate. Under the calculation conditions, the gas production rates when considering different values of TPG are approximately 35%–70% less than those for cases without TPG. In addition, the gas production rate and total gas production decrease as the bottom hole pressure and TPG increase, but they increase with the fracture half length. However, these factors have little influence on the water production regardless of the incorporation of TPG. The research expands the theoretical basis of gas recovery from the tight coal seams and provides a more accurate method to predict the gas production rate efficiently. "

This work aims to solve those problems in fractured reservoir simulation. The newly introduced Multi-Porosity Model honors any number of porosity types with different properties, such as permeability, porosity and wettability thus achieving significant improvements over conventional Dual-Porosity Models. Arbitrary connections for intra-porosity flow and inter-porosity flow are incorporated into the design to allow for the convenient transformation between Multi-Porosity and Multi-Permeability formulations. The addition of a flexible subdivision in each porosity system has allowed us to characterize the transient flow for inter-porosity flow. Due to the low permeability in the matrix, transient flow between matrix and fracture dominates, and thus matrix spatial subdivision is necessary to accurately capture the dynamics. The formulation is designed to allow the proposed scheme to be generalized. To quantify the improvements available with the new formulation, several typical Multi-Porosity Models are compared with Fine-Grid Single-Porosity Models. Consistent results have been obtained with those similar cases from literature, and the robustness and efficiency of the model is validated. Besides, the extra matrix subdivision is proven to accurately capture the transient fluid transfer between matrix and fracture. "

The study of remaining oil percolation characteristics under microscopic pore scale plays an important role in enhanced oil recovery for ultrahigh water cut period water flood reservoirs. In this paper, glass etching microscopic model experiments and computer image processing & recognition techniques are combined to reclassify the microscopic remaining oil flowing patterns which considering the flowing shape and the linkage among the oil, water and rock. Then we design different etching models, study the effect of pore-throat ratio, pore throat radius, coordination number, inject speed and oil viscosity on the flowing patterns and variation of microscopic remaining oil. Research results indicate all the remaining oil in ultra-high water cut period can be classified into five categories: clustered stream, multi-porous stream, columnar stream, membranous stream and droplet stream. Among of the five categories, clustered stream possesses the largest proportion and is also the main factor of relative permeability curves bended. Meanwhile, as water saturation increases, clustered stream gradually transformed into other patterns, like multi-porous stream, columnar stream, membranous stream and droplet stream. Sensitivity analysis based on pore structure shows that: (1) the larger pore radius, the greater the maximum water saturation, the stronger capability of the continuous phase flow through porous media, and the smaller the clustered stream percentage; (2) the larger pore throat ratio, the easier broken the remaining oil and occurring as non-continuous phase in the pores, and the smaller the maximum water saturation; (3) the larger the coordination number, the better the pore connectivity, the smaller the maximum water saturation; (4) the smaller shape factor, the more complex the porosity, the smaller the maximum water saturation, the easier the remaining oil is transformed into a non-continuous phase\". Meanwhile, the greater the oil viscosity, the smaller the maximum water saturation, while the greater the injection rate, the greater the maximum water saturation. Also we found that the occurring occasion of clustered stream inflection point is positively correlated to the maximum water saturation. In this study, we not only provide the computation code which can recognize and analyze flowing remaining oil, but also explain the oil-water relative permeability curves non-linearity during ultra-high water cut period from the microscopic point of view. The achievements of this study are also the foundation of water flood reservoir ultra-high water cut period improved remaining oil sweeping efficiency and enhanced oil recovery. "

For a reservoir engineer, establishing a utility method which can be both numerically efficient and practically accurate is the greatest challenge of shale gas reservoirs numerical simulation. Naturally fractured shale gas reservoirs, which must be fractured before production, include many complex fracture networks (natural fracture and hydraulic fracture) that cannot be easily modeled by the simple continuous medium model (CMM), the discrete fracture model (DFM) or the discrete fracture network (DFN) model. In this paper, we propose a utility discrete fracture network (UDFN) model in which natural fractures are modeled by an analytic correction to matrix permeability, and hydraulic fractures are modeled by the DFN in which fractures are modeled explicitly. The partial differential equations are solved by Newton Raphson method through the C Sharp programing. Case studies reveal that the UDFN's computational speed improves orders of magnitude than those of the DFN and DFM when dealing with the same problem, while the numerical result from UDFN method keeps enough accuracy to match the production curves as well as the results from the DFN. Meanwhile, the UDFN not only can simulate individual fracture's effects explicitly like DFM, but also can match up better to the field production than the DFM. The method developed in this paper improved the simulation of multiple stage fractured horizontal wells performance in naturally fractured formations. It also makes the naturally fractured shale gas reservoirs numerical model much more concise and practical to the field case appplication. "

Recent research investigations have shown the potential for the application of nanoparticles as contrast agents for reservoir characterization and advanced reservoir surveillance. This paper demonstrates a new technique for using nanoparticles as contrast agents mixed with proppants that can enhance borehole geophysical measurements, such as magnetic susceptibility, thereby improving the near-wellbore detection of proppants in hydraulic fractures. The methods used in this paper include both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The experimental approach consists of (a) synthesizing paramagnetic nanoparticles and (b) carrying out a series of magnetic susceptibility core logging measurements, in the presence of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles (i.e., with a core/shell structure with size of 60–70 nm) mixed with proppants. Numerical simulations are performed simultaneously to confirm that the nanoparticles remain concentrated in hydraulic fractures as is demonstrated in the experimental work. We developed a two-phase flow model to investigate the spatial distribution of nanoparticles when they are injected into a hydraulically fractured porous media, in which the hydraulic fractures are filled with propping agents. Furthermore, we used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of heterogeneity as well as rock and fracture properties on spatial distribution of nanoparticles in the porous media. The results of laboratory experiments showed that the relative enhancement of the volume susceptibility of the fractured zones depend on factors such as the type of proppants (e.g., magnetic versus non-magnetic proppants), the concentration of nanoparticles in the injected solution, and the volume of nanoparticle solution and proppants. The use of magnetic nanoparticles lead to a significant enhancement in the detection of fractures, even with widths as small as 0.3 cm. The numerical simulations on synthetic examples show that the nanoparticle concentration in hydraulic fractures is significantly higher than that in the surrounding porous rock in the case of tight formations. We have then illustrated from the experimental and numerical methods that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles, which are mainly concentrated in the fractures can be used as contrast agents mixed with the proppants to highlight the fractures and detect the location of proppants. This detection technique can be applied in the field by using the borehole magnetic susceptibility tools for pre-fracturing and post-fracturing measurements in open-hole wells. "

                    "abstract": "Compositional reservoir simulation depicts the complex behaviors of all the components in gaseous, liquid, and oil phases. It helps to understand the dynamic changes in reservoirs. Parallel computing is implemented to speed up simulation in large scale fields. However, there is still many challenges in obtaining efficient and cost-effective parallel reservoir simulation. Load imbalance on processors in the parallel machine is a major problem and it severely affects the performance of parallel implementation in compositional reservoir simulators. This article presents a new approach to the reduction of load imbalance among processors in large scale parallel compositional reservoir simulation. The approach is based on graph partitioning techniques: Metis partitioning and spectral partitioning. These techniques treat the simulation grid, or the mesh, as a graph constituted by vertices and edges, and then partition the graph into smaller domains. Metis and spectral partitioning techniques are advantageous because they take into account the potential computational load of each grid block in the mesh and generate smaller partitions for heavy computational load areas and larger partitions for light computational load areas. In our case, the computational load is represented by transmissibility. After new partitions are generated, each of them is assigned to a processor in the parallel machine and new parallel reservoir simulation can be conducted. Traditionally, the intuitive 2D decomposition is frequently used to partition the simulation grid into small rectangles, and this is a major source of load imbalance. The performance of parallel compositional simulation based on our partitioning techniques is compared with the most commonly used 2D decomposition and it is found that load imbalance in our new simulations is reduced when compared with the traditional 2D decomposition. This study improves the efficiency of compositional simulation and eventually makes it more cost-effective for hydrocarbon simulation on mega-scale reservoir models. "

                    "abstract": "The application of nanoparticles has successfully attracted much attention due to the potential advantages of nanotechnology to lead to revolutionary changes in the oil and gas industry, such as nano-scale sensors, enhanced oil recovery and subsurface mapping. This paper will study the potential application of magnetic nanoparticles as contrast agents to enhance signals from well logging as well as improve reservoir and fracture characterization. Little work has been conducted to establish numerical models for investigating nanoparticle transport in reservoirs, and even less for unconventional reservoirs. Unlike conventional reservoirs, shale formations could contain four different pore systems: inorganic matter, organic matter dominated by hydrocarbon wettability, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. These various pore media increase the difficulty to exactly describe the transport of nanoparticles along with aqueous phase. Concurrently, hydraulic fractures and the associated stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) from induced fractures need to be considered in hydraulically fractured reservoirs because of its significant assistance to well productivity. We have developed a mathematical model for simulating nanoparticle transport in shale reservoirs. The simulator includes various flow mechanisms from Darcy flow, Brownian diffusion of nanoparticles, gas diffusion and desorption, slippage flow, and capillary effects based on the extremely low permeability and micro- to nano-scale of the pores. Moreover, these mechanisms are separately applied to the sub-media of the reservoir due to the variation of media properties. Firstly, numerical applications including both two-dimensional micro model and macro model are presented, both models with organic matter randomly distributed within the matrix. Based on the integral finite difference and Newton–Raphson method, the distribution of water saturation and nanoparticle mass are calculated and graphically shown in different time steps. The main conclusion from these models is, as expected, nanoparticles can easily flow along with the aqueous phase into the fractures, but their transport into the shale matrix is quite limited, with even less transport shown into the organic matter of matrix. Secondly, a large reservoir model containing SRV is built to investigate the effect of magnetic nanoparticles on the volumetric magnetic susceptibility (VMS) of the reservoir. Based on the measured properties of synthesized magnetic carbon-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles, the distribution of the VMS is simulated and displayed in the numerical cases with and without magnetic nanoparticles. Besides, several different grids are chosen to display the varying trend of VMS along with time. The numerical results demonstrate that magnetic nanoparticles can effectively enlarge the VMS and the magnetization of reservoir, thus producing enhanced signals from well logging devices such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). This simulator can provide the benefits of both numerically simulating the transport and distribution of nanoparticles in hydraulically fractured shale formations and supplying helpful guidance for nanoparticles injection plans to enhance well logging signals and improve petrophysical evaluation. Furthermore, this model could also allow us to simulate the tracer transport flow in unconventional reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "With the technology advancement in unconventional reservoirs development, more and more attention has been paid to nanoporous flow which is believed to play a central role in understanding fluid flow behaviors in unconventional reservoirs. Previous studies have performed unconventional reservoir analysis using more conventional reservoir simulation techniques. However, conventional numerical simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not understand fluid flow behaviors well in terms of theory basis. In this paper, we first present a new motion equation considering diffusion and convection and Lattice Boltzmann method is applied to model the gas flow characteristics to obtain the important parameters in the new general equation. Then the mathematical model of gas flow behaviors in multi-scale medium were proposed and established based on theoretical analysis of transport mechanism via molecular kinetic theory. The pressure distribution equations of radial and linear flow were derived for different flow regimes analytically, and the computation method of the control area of gas well was presented. Additionally, the semi-analytical equations of volumetric flow rate for horizontal fractured wells were obtained. At last through Newton iterative method, the non-linear volumetric flow rate was analyzed, considering various factors such as SRV permeability, unstimulated shale permeability, and diffusion coefficient. Barnett shale production data is used to calibrate and validate this new approach. According to the results, the volumetric flow rate of the gas well increases when the diffusion coefficient grows. Consequently diffusion in unconventional reservoirs with nanoporous media plays an important role. With changing the average pore diameters, different results are simulated and calculated by LBM and the most appropriate values can be confirmed by comparing the experimental results. Besides, the intrinsic permeability of unstimulated shale and permeability of SRV are also found have apparent positive correlation with the gas productivity. "

In such reservoirs there likely exists more than two porosity types, and transient flow likely occurs in the matrix. Dual porosity models can characterize only two porosity types and are difficult to accurately capture the transient flow. This paper discusses an advanced model that allows simulating an arbitrary number of porosity types which accurately captures the transient flow in the matrix. The proposed multiple porosity model honors any number of porosity types with different properties, such as permeability, porosity and wettability. Arbitrary connection for intra-porosity and inter-porosity flow are designed in an unstructured scheme, and convenient transformation between multiple porosity and multiple permeability formulations is allowed. A flexible porosity subdivision works in a fashion of hierarchical refinement and allows us to characterize the transient flow in the matrix and multilevel fracture sets with different geometry as well. The formulation is designed to allow the proposed scheme to be generalized. To quantify the improvement available with the new formulation, multiple porosity models are compared with single porosity models and analysis of different shape factors are also conducted. Our results show that they can be made to be equivalent under single phase conditions. Moreover, the application of the new model in shale reservoirs is discussed in two phase flow cases considering mixed wettability in shale matrix, and the results show that through a complete inter-porosity connection mode, the flow pathway of gas and water in shale is effectively identified.

                    "abstract": "Data analysis is one of the most important topics in any industry. In petroleum engineering, the large, complex, and multi-dimensional reservoir data sets (big data) presents a challenge for engineers to study the masses of unstructured information and make decisions. A new approach to analyze complex data is called Topological Data Analysis (TDA) which aims to extract meaningful information from such data. TDA relies on the concept that complex data has shapes where shape has meanings. It analyzes the shape of complex data, identifying clusters and their statistical significance. The objective of this paper is to introduce TDA to reservoir engineering using an example of inverted 4D seismic data for studying reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization. In this paper, we introduce the principles of TDA and discuss its potential in reservoir engineering, which could allow identification of reservoir engineering data behavior, recognition of new opportunities, detection of anomalies and events, and minimizing uncertainties. The TDA procedures are introduced using inverted 4D seismic data set to study reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization. The process to generate and process the data set is explained. Similarity distance function and lenses are defined and used to create TDA graphs for feature identification and analysis. It is shown that TDA is able to predict the compartmentaliztion of the reservoir models with various process configurations. Variance normalized Euclidean and topological neighborhood function are used successfully to compartmentalize the reservoir model. Using normalized input dataset, correlation and principle component analysis also create similar compartments. The success of TDA in discovering meaningful patterns is attributed to the similarity distance function representing the objective of study, one or more lenses exposing the data, and the right combination of input data, similarity distance function and lenses. A promising big data analysis method, TDA, is introduced to reservoir engineering application with principles, procedures and examples. It has been shown that TDA can automatically discover critical intelligence within the 4D seismic data set for studying reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization, which are essential to the accuracy of forecasts and development plans, the validity of reservoir simulation, and the success of performance diagnostics and optimization.

                    "abstract": "The modeling and numerical simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoirs are extremely challenging due to non-Darcy flow in vugs and caves connected by fracture networks. The momentum balance of such flow has been shown to be better described by the Brinkman equation both physically and mathematically, and many methods have been proposed in the literature dealing with the steady-state Brinkman model. We carry Brinkman's idea one step further and propose a transient flow model which consists of the Brinkman equation and a generalized material balance equation, and the latter has proven to be exact in the fractured carbonate karst reservoir. Finite differences are implemented for the solution of the proposed transient flow model. This solution method is more straightforward, easier to derive and implement, and more apt to generalization from 2D to 3D cases than alternative techniques. Numerical simulation of the transient Brinkman model requires explicit solution of not only pressure at the center of each grid block, but also velocities at the interfaces between the blocks, which exaggerates the computational cost and makes the computational process more difficult and less stable. In this paper, we propose a simplified finite difference formulation of the transient Brinkman model, which significantly reduces the computational time of the simulation process, and improves accuracy and stability of the simulation results. We update our reservoir simulator with this new formulation and illustrate it with a complex 3D naturally fractured carbonate karst reservoir model. The results of this study form the foundation for future 3D multi-phase reservoir cases. "

However, modeling such reservoirs is a challenging task due to the co-existence of porous and free-flow domains over a wide range of scales. Realistic characterization of fractured vuggy reservoirs requires preservation of the geological structure and reproduction of patterns. In this study, we model a discrete fracture-vug network using microtomography and multiple-point geostatistics (MPG) modeling technique. For this purpose, one micro-CT scan image of a real core is used to generate a micro-scale geological model (the reference model and the first training image) having three structures; matrix, fractures, and vugs. The structures in the reference model are also separated into matrix-fracture and matrix-vug to construct two other training images. The three training images are then used in MPG to generate multiple equiprobable models that mimic the original networks of the fractures and vugs. The models created using matrix-fracture and matrix-vug training images are combined into fracture-vug-matrix models by superimposing the fracture networks from the matrix-fracture models on their corresponding matrix-vug models. The spatial continuity, patterns reproduction, and flow performance of the generated models are compared with those of the reference model. The results show that, although the fracture patterns are not well reproduced, all the generated realizations preserved the structures and reproduced the spatial continuity of the reference model. In addition, the study revealed that the flow curves of the models generated with the introduced combined MPG method bracket better with the curve of the reference model than those of the direct MPG method. These results lay the foundation for future application of the presented method to field-scale modeling of naturally fractured vuggy reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Multiple porosity systems exist in shale reservoirs: organic matter, inorganic matter, natural fractures and hydraulic fractures. Accurately simulating fluid storage and flow in this complex environment still remains a challenge. One key is to properly account for the multi-component adsorption and diffusion phenomena occurring in the shale matrix. Most studies conducted in recent years use a single gas phase model or a black oil model to consider these aspects. A compositional model specifically tailored for the characteristics of shale reservoirs is required to properly model all of the physics. In this paper, such a compositional model is introduced. The model takes the pressure and component molar masses as the primary variables, and applies the IMPEM method (implicit pressure and explicit mass) as the solution technique at the current stage. The multi-component adsorption and diffusion terms are incorporated into the component mass balance equations. Adsorption is described through the Extended Langmuir equation, and multi-component diffusion can be described either through the classical or the generalized Fick's law. The latter has the capacity of accounting for component interactions and the phase thermodynamic non-ideality. Knudsen diffusion can also be incorporated through the concept of an augmented effective diffusion coefficient. Several preliminary tests have been conducted to validate the model. The influences of the important parameters, such as total carbon content, wettability, and fluid composition, on shale reservoir fluid recovery were also investigated with the new simulator. "

A significant advantage of the presented model is its flexibility to incorporate different petrophysical and geological properties to each sub-media. Such capability extends the applicability of our approach to almost all carbon rich mudrocks with different levels of heterogeneity. Various production scenarios were then simulated to evaluate performance of the model. Although a very rich source of hydrocarbon, our results show that relatively high capillary pressure and very low rock permeability hinder oil production in organic-rich shale. Additionally, excessive pressure drop in the near fracture region and localized large gas to oil mobility ratio was observed to impact oil production rate. "

From the numerical results, we can conclude that the injection rate, cumulative CO2 injected, and the storage efficiency for the case with TPG are always less than those of the case without TPG because of the sharp pressure decline and increased energy consumption. Under this paper's calculation condition, the storage efficiency when considering TPG is about 10% less than the case without considering TPG. If the TPG effect was to be ignored in the design of CO2 storage in low permeability saline aquifers, the CO2 storage efficiency will be overestimated.

This work proposes a partitioning scheme to divide porous media in shale into three different sub-media (porosity systems) with distinctive characteristics: inorganic matter and kerogen (in the shale matrix), along with fracture network (natural or hydraulic). The current model gives us the capability of better analyzing the complex nature of mass transfer in shale. Relative permeabilities in our model are accounted for by employing the functions specifically presented for shale reservoirs. Our model can also handle various flow and storage mechanisms corresponding with shales such as molecule/wall interactions and slippage of the gas phase, multicomponent desorption, and capillarities. Simulation results show that hydrocarbon production from shale reservoirs exhibits complicated dynamics that are controlled by a number of different factors. Because of very high capillary pressure in shale, water is observed to imbibe into the water-wet inorganic matter during the late production period. On the contrary, mass flow in the oil-wet kerogen is mostly limited to two-phase oil and gas flow. Although kerogen is considered to be a rich source of hydrocarbon, relatively high capillary pressure and very low rock permeability hinder oil production in organic-rich shale. We might be able to address such problems by employing an appropriate production enhancement technique compatible with the ultra-tight nature of such reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Reliable detection of propping agents in fractures has been a challenge for the petroleum Industry. Researchers are currently investigating the application of nanoparticles as contrast agents for reservoir characterization and advanced reservoir surveillance. This paper demonstrates the use of nanoparticles as contrast agents mixed with proppants that can enhance signals from borehole geophysical measurements, thereby improving the detection of proppants in hydraulic fractures. The methods used in this paper study include both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The experimental approach consists of (a) synthesizing paramagnetic nanoparticles and (b) carrying out a series of magnetic susceptibility core logging measurements, using the superparamagnetic nanoparticles mixed withy proppants. Numerical simulations are performed simultaneously to show that the distribution of nanoparticles remain concentrated in hydraulic fractures as is demonstrated in our experimental work. We developed a two-phase flow model to investigate the spatial distribution of nanoparticles when they are injected into a hydraulically fractured porous media, in which the hydraulic fractures are filled with propping agents. Furthermore, we used numerical simulations to investigate the effects of heterogeneity as well as rock and fracture properties on spatial distribution on nanoparticles in the porous media. We successfully synthesized paramagnetic nanoparticles with a core/shell structure with size of 60 nm–70 nm. The hysteresis loops obtained from the magnetic measurements demonstrate magnetic stability of the nanoparticles at both surface and reservoir temperatures. The magnetic nanoparticles provided high sensitivity when used as contrast agents in magnetic susceptibility measurements of carbonate and organic shale samples.  The relative enhancement of the volume susceptibility depends on the minerals present within the formation, concentration of the nanoparticle solution, and the magnetic composition of the proppants. The results of the numerical simulations confirmed the effectiveness of using nanoparticles as contrast agents in highlight fractures and, hence, the location of the proppants. We have demonstrated in the synthetic examples that the nanoparticle concentration in hydraulic fractures is significantly higher than that in the surrounding porous rock in the case of low permeability formations, suggesting that hydraulic fractures can be clearly differentiated from the surrounding formations. We have thus illustrated from the experimental and numerical methods that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles which are mainly concentrated in the fractures can be used as contrast agents mixed with the proppants to highlight the fractures and detect the location of proppants. The prospect of injecting magnetic nanoparticles as contrasting agents along with propping agents during fracture treatment is promising for the accurate monitoring and tracking of propping agent. More developments on this approach will lead to improvement in the determination of the hydraulic-fracture geometry, which is of great value in designing hydraulic fracture treatments. "

However, we approach this challenge by introducing a method to enhance the sensitivity of well logs to petrophysical properties of the formation and to the presence of natural fractures using nanoparticles as contrast agents that can travel into the rock. We quantify the effect of petrophysical properties of porous media on the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles injected as contrasting agents to the formation.

We documented the results of numerical simulations for homogenous and heterogeneous naturally fractured porous media. The effluent history from the coreflood of sandstone with the synthesized nanoparticle solution confirms the results from numerical simulations. We showed that the nanoparticles are mostly concentrated in the connected natural fractures when the permeability of matrix is significantly lower than that of fractures.

This paper quantifies the effect of petrophysical properties of porous media on the spatial distribution of magnetic nanoparticles injected as contrasting agents to the formation. We achieved this goal by developing a two-phase fluid flow numerical simulator for transport of injected nanoparticles in homogenous and heterogeneous rocks. We also synthesized nanoparticles and characterized their morphology and magnetic properties. These particles contain an iron oxide core and a carbon shell, which increase the stability of nanoparticles. The effluent history of nanoparticles injected into rocks in coreflood experiments was used to validate the performance of the developed numerical simulator. We documented the results of numerical simulations for homogenous and heterogeneous naturally-fractured porous media. The rate of transport of the nanoparticles increases as the permeability increases as a result of the effects of advection and dispersion. However, radial length of nanoparticle invasion decreases as the porosity increases. The presence of natural fractures increases the transport of nanoparticles as a result of higher permeability in fractures. The sensitivity analysis shows negligible impact of nanoparticle size on the spatial distribution of nanoparticles in the case of 1-nm-diameter, 10-nm-diameter, and 100-nm-diameter nanoparticles because of the dominance of dispersion over diffusion effects. The effluent history from the coreflood of sandstone with the synthesized nanoparticle solution closely predicts the results from numerical simulations. In this paper, we use a numerical simulation approach to identify the factors affecting transport of nanoparticles in the near wellbore region, which in turn affect borehole geophysical measurements.

                    "abstract": "Shale reservoirs are characterized by ultra-low permeability, multiple porosity types, and complex fluid storage and flow mechanisms. Consequentially the feasibility of performing simulations using conventional Dual Porosity Models based on Darcy flow has been frequently challenged. Additionally, tracking of water in shale continues to be controversial and mysterious. In organic-rich shale, kerogen is generally dispersed in the inorganic matter. Kerogen is different from any other shale constituents because it tends to be hydrocarbon-wet, abundant in nanopores, fairly porous and capable of adsorbing gas. However, the inorganic matter is usually water wet with low porosity such that capillary pressure becomes the dominant driving mechanism for water flow, especially during hydraulic fracturing operations. This work presents a technique of subdividing shale matrices and capturing different mechanisms including Darcy flow, gas diffusion and desorption, and capillary pressure. The extension of this technique forms a solid and comprehensive basis for a specially-designed simulator for fractured shale reservoirs at the micro-scale. Through the use of this unique simulator, this paper presents a micro-scale two-phase flow model which covers three continua (organic matter, inorganic matter and natural fractures) and considers the complex dynamics in shale. In the model, TOC is an indispensable parameter to characterize the kerogen in the shale. A unique tool for general multiple porosity systems is used so that several porosity systems can be tied to each other through arbitrary connections. The new model allows us to better understand the complex flow mechanisms and to observe the water transfer behavior between shale matrices and fractures under a microscopic view. Sensitivity analysis studies on the contributions of different flow mechanisms, kerogen properties, water saturation and capillary pressure are also presented. "

                    "abstract": "A typical tight oil reservoir such as the Bakken has matrix pore sizes ranging from 10 nm to 50 nm. At such small scales the confined hydrocarbon phase behavior deviates from bulk measurements due to the effect of capillary pressure. In addition, compaction of pore space can bring about order of magnitude changes for tight oil formation properties during pressure depletion further exacerbating these deviations. Without considering these facts a conventional reservoir simulator will likely not be able to explain the inconsistent produced GOR observed in the field compared to simulated results. The effect of these inaccuracies on ultimate recovery estimation can be devastating to the underlying economics. This paper presents a compositional tight oil simulator that rigorously models pressure dependent nanopore-impacted rock and fluid properties, such as suppression of bubble point pressure, decrease of liquid density, and reduction of oil viscosity as well as their interactions with pore space compaction. The cubic Peng-Robinson equation of state is used for phase behavior calculations. Capillary pressure is evaluated by standard Leverett J-function for porous media. Modifications to the stability test and two-phase split flash calculation algorithms are provided to consider the capillarity effect on vapor-liquid equilibrium. The simulator can capture the pressure-dependent impact of the nanopore structure on rock and fluid properties. As a result, the problem of inconsistent GOR is resolved and the history matching process is greatly facilitated. It is shown that inclusion of these enhanced physics in the simulation will lead to significant improvements in field operation decision-making and greatly enhance the reliability of recovery predictions.

                    "abstract": "The mechanisms of shale gas storage and flow are complex. Understanding the microstructure is an important step for evaluating a new shale gas play toward accurate reserve estimation and recovery prediction. The emphasis of this paper is study on the micro-fractures observed on the research shale formation. The approaches involved in this study include experimental study and numerical modeling. Longmaxi Shale, which is an emerging Lower Silurian marine shale gas play in China with huge potential according to preliminary explorations, is the research formation in this paper. Core samples used in the experiment are collected from the target layer of Longmaxi Shale. The pore structure is visualized in nano-scale using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). In order to evaluate the influence of micro-fracture, a micro-model is built to explicitly simulate the micro-factures. The effect of micro-fracture on gas drainage capacity of shale matrix is then scaled up to a well model using a triple porosity approach. SEM images reveal well-developed micro-fractures on the Longmaxi Shale. Micro-fractures exhibit strong heterogeneity. The width, length and connectivity of the micro-fractures vary notably. This feature is believed can significantly influent the gas drainage capacity of shale matrix and as a result well performance. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying micro-fracture density, width, length and connectivity. Results show that micro-fracture plays an important role in production performance. This is because that the well-developed micro-fractures enhance the gas drainage capacity of shale matrix. Thus, micro-fractures observed in Longmaxi Shale have to be considered in evaluating potentials of this new shale gas play. This study characterizes the microstructure of Longmaxi Shale and discusses the significance of micro-fractures, which provides important information to support engineers and geologist for better understanding the marine shale and optimizing production plan on the marine shale. Introduction Shale gas remains one of the hottest topics in the petroleum industry. China has huge shale gas reserves and good development prospects (Wang et al., 2009; Zou et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2012). The target formation in our study, the Silurian Longmaxi Shale, is marine black shale in southern China. According to the detailed petrophysical study on this formation, Longmaxi Shale has good TOC (1.62%) and Ro (3.69%), moderate gas content (45 scf/ton), brittle formation (quartz and calcite account for more than 50% of the total minerals), and the porosity (2.4%) is relatively low but permeability is favorable (Wei et al, 2013). In addition, compared with successfully developed shale gas reservoirs in the US, the Longmaxi Shale is buried deeper, and has low TOC, low gas content, high maturity, high clay content, low quartz content, low porosity, and better permeability. The possible reasons for the better permeability are larger pore diameters, better pore connection, and well-developed micro-fractures. So the microstructure characterization of shale gas reservoirs should be emphasized. SEM (Scanning electron microscope) is a modern microscale visualization technology. It utilizes a focused beam of electrons, which scan across the sample surface to provide information about the morphology and composition of the sample. SEM usually has two modes, back-scattered mode and secondary mode. Back-scattered mode provides information about the distribution of different elements because that mode strongly related to the atomic number of the elements; the higher the gray level, the lower the atomic number of the element. The kerogen can be easily found under this mode. Secondary mode is the most commonly used mode to provide high resolution images depicting the microstructure characteristics. In this study, we visualized the pore structures for the samples from the target layer of the Longmaxi Shale by using SEM. "

Petrophysical characterization is an important step for a new shale gas play to better understand the geology of the formation, and it provides vital data to optimize production plan and stimulation design. However, there is little research on correlations between petrophysical parameters for shale gas reservoirs. The methodologies involved in this study include experimental study, outcrop observation, statistical analysis, and numerical modeling. The Longmaxi shale formation, which is an emerging Lower Silurian marine shale play in China with huge potential according to preliminary explorations, was characterized petrophysically in detail, and research on correlations between different petrophysical parameters was conducted. More than 100 ft core samples were collected from target layers for experiments. Also, the reservoir properties of the Longmaxi shale were compared with those of shale gas plays in the United States, such as the Barnett and Marcellus. Furthermore, based on a robust in-house simulator exclusively for shale gas, a reservoir model was developed by integration of those available petrophysical data to evaluate the key production drivers for typical shale gas reservoirs. After integrating results from all these methodologies and technologies, total organic content (TOC), vitrinite reflectance (Ro), porosity, permeability, mineralogy, and gas content were obtained. Then, analysis was carefully conducted, and some interesting observations were found, such as an intimate correlation between the clay content and desorbed gas content. Additionally, both similarities and differences between petrophysical properties were concluded from comparison between the Longmaxi Shale and shale gas plays in the US. Moreover, Simulation results quantified the effects of natural fractures and desorption for the production performance. This study provides a methodology for understanding and characterizing other shale plays. In addition, it offers detailed evidence to support engineers and geologists for understanding the geology and optimizing production plan on the marine shale. Introduction In the last decade, the petroleum industry began to shift its focus from conventional reservoirs to unconventional reservoirs. Shale gas is one of the most remarkable unconventional resources due to its huge potential. The production performance of a shale gas well mainly depends on the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) which is the impacting reservoir volume caused by hydraulic fracturing (Economides, 2011; Qin et al, 2012). Petrophysical characterization is the starting point toward successful stimulation and production. However, the characteristics of shale gas reservoirs, such as extra-tight formations, increase the difficulty of determining their petrophysical properties. In addition, the properties of shale gas formations differ significantly from one to another and are hard to estimate or obtain by analogy based on other shale gas plays. "

The causes of loadimbalance in parallel reservoir simulation are both static and dynamic. Robustgraph-partitioning algorithms are capable of handling static load imbalance bydecomposing the underlying reservoir geometry to distribute a roughly equalload to each processor. However, these loads that are determined by a staticload balancer seldom remain unchanged as the simulation proceeds in time. Thisso-called dynamic imbalance can be exacerbated further in parallelcompositional simulations. The flash calculations for equations of state (EOSs)in complex compositional simulations not only can consume more than half of thetotal execution time but also are difficult to balance merely by a static loadbalancer. The computational cost of flash calculations in each gridblockheavily depends on the dynamic data such as pressure, temperature, andhydrocarbon composition. Thus, any static assignment of gridblocks may lead todynamic load imbalance in unpredictable manners. A dynamic load balancer canoften provide solutions for this difficulty. However, traditional techniquesare inflexible and tedious to implement in legacy reservoir simulators. In thispaper, we present a new approach to address dynamic load imbalance in parallelcompositional simulation. It overdecomposes the reservoir model to assign eachprocessor a bundle of subdomains. Processors treat these bundles of subdomainsas virtual processes or user-level migratable threads which can be dynamicallymigrated across processors in the run-time system. This technique is shown tobe capable of achieving better overlap between computation and communicationfor cache efficiency. We use this approach in a legacy reservoir simulator anddemonstrate a reduction in the execution time of parallel compositionalsimulations while requiring minimal changes to the source code. Finally, it isshown that domain overdecomposition, together with a load balancer, can improvespeedup from 29.27 to 62.38 on 64 physical processors for a realisticsimulation problem. "

The CML method is a variant of the popular Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) method yet with essential differences. The basic idea of this new approach is to construct a hierarchy of matrices by viewing the underlying matrix as a graph and by using the discrete geometry of the graph such as graph separators and expansion. In this way, the CML method combines the merits of both geometric and algebraic multigrid methods. The resulting hybrid approach not only provides a simpler and faster set-up phase compared to AMG, but the method can be proved to exhibit strong convergence guarantees for arbitrary symmetric diagonally-dominant matrices. In addition, the underlying theoretical soundness of the CML method contrasts to the heuristic AMG approach, which often can show slow convergence for difficult problems. This new approach is implemented in a reservoir simulator for both pressure and displacement preconditioners in the multi-stage preconditioning technique. We present results based on several known benchmark problems and provide a comparison of performance and complexity with the widespread preconditioning schemes used in large-scale reservoir simulation. An adaptation of CML for unsymmetric matrices is shown to exhibit excellent convergence properties for realistic cases.  "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Modern simulation capabilities were recently applied to the K2 Field to help define a risk-reducing phased development. This integrated study relied heavily on new advances to handle complex fluid behavior, derive a history match, resolve future behavior of sub-sea wells, and seamlessly review economic metrics.  Simulations used tightly-coupled surface and subsurface calculations to capture and stabilize the interaction of surface facilities with the reservoir. This robust and rigorous approach improves upon previously reported techniques in which subsurface flow calculations are only loosely coupled to the surface network. Fluid characterization involved a single equation of state with multiple distributed component sets in reservoirs and compositional mixing within the surface network. Super-critical initialization was used to represent an unusual compositional transition from a highly undersaturated oil rim to an undersaturated gas cap. History match parameters included reservoir, facilities, and well properties.  A host of development options involving artificial lift (AL), additional wells, miscible gas injection, and water injection was evaluated for economic value through an optimization-under-uncertainty approach. This assessment guided a multi-disciplinary project team to detail a short set of developments for highest consideration in a common situation where the complex interactions among the reservoir, wells, outflow network, and facilities, makes an intuitive solution inaccessible. Although the four geologic models used were considered adequately diverse for the study, further value lies in broadening the geological uncertainty and hence the range of possible outcomes.  While a relatively new application in deepwater fields, AL is recognized as a technology to extend producing life for mature fields and enable production from challenging plays such as the Gulf of Mexico lower Tertiary. Few case studies addressing such situations are available. The presented workflow may be repeated on assets with significant outflow performance drivers - assets that would benefit from modeling and resolution of complex surface/subsurface interactions.  Introduction K2 is located in the Green Canyon protraction area; in the Mississippi fan fold belt (Fig. 1). It is one of the early deepwater sub-salt projects, a close second in the industry only to Mad Dog. The field is unitized across several lease blocks (Fig. 2). The first phase of K2 development is comprised of eight Subsea producers connected by a high pressure Subsea gathering system to the Marco Polo Tension Leg Platform, six miles to the SE. Cumulative production as of January 2011 was 34 MMBO and 25 BCF. With a hydrocarbon column height that exceeds 5000 ft, estimated in-place resource exceeds 2 BBOE. The developed reservoir intervals lie in Miocene formations with favorable rock and fluid properties (Table 1). The Marco Polo platform sits in 4,300 feet of water. Its capacity is 120,000 BPD and start of service was July 2004. K2 first oil was May 2005.  During its first five years of production, K2 field oil rates show a quick ramp up, peak, and then a period that could be interpreted as an erratic decline (Fig. 3). A sharp drop in early 2008 is due to a combination of safety valve failures and onset of severe completion skin in several wells. A long interruption in late 2008 is from the effects of Hurricane Ike. Efforts to restore full well productivity continue. Only a small fraction of the resource has been produced and much remains to be learned about the reservoirs from well performance. Significant development decisions remain such as potential for AL, additional wells, waterflood and even Enhanced Oil Recovery.  The subject study was conducted as part of a multi-disciplinary effort to evaluate future development alternatives, with a particular emphasis on short-term AL options for the M14 and M20 reservoirs in the K2 field. Most of the work took place in 2009 and early 2010, however elements of the study come from prior contributions. The team followed a traditional workflow but relied heavily on interdisciplinary collaboration and several new engineering advances. "

                    "title": "Automatic Decomposition for Parallel Reservoir Simulation",
                    "abstract": "Abstract A large amount of research in domain decomposition methods for parallel computing has been carried out in the last twenty years. This paper presents an automatic domain decomposition framework for parallel reservoir simulation. It emphasizes practical issues and implementation rather than theoretical complexity. At least three main factors affect the parallel simulator performance when decomposing the domain for the given total number of sub-grids: 1) the active cell distribution in the reservoir, 2) reservoir geometry, and 3) fault locations. This discussion primarily focuses on the active cell distribution to improve the performance of the parallel reservoir simulator by load balancing.  Four domain decomposition algorithms are implemented before determining the best decomposition for the given total number of sub-domains. These four algorithms applied to all factors of the total number of sub-domains. The ideal decomposition for active cells and the offset size between the ideal number and real number from each scenario are then calculated. The smallest offset size determines the best decomposition.  Several examples, such as a synthetic model, a GOM (Gulf of Mexico) model with over 550,000+ grid blocks and a synthetic African reservoir compositional model, illustrate the improved parallel simulator performance resulting from the automatic decomposition framework. For both cases, the reservoir models were decomposed by different algorithms, and the CPU time for each algorithm was summarized. The automatic decomposition framework provides an effective way to improve the parallel simulator performance.  Introduction Parallel computing is becoming a prime option to the Linux cluster approach for solving large-scale problems that arise from the reservoir simulation applications. Domain decomposition techniques appear to be a natural way to make good use of parallel computers. These techniques divide a computation into a local part, which may be done without any inter-processor communication, and a part that involves communication between neighboring and distant processors. As described here, domain decomposition represents one of a class of geometric decomposition methods. Such methods generally assign grid blocks that are physically close to one another to achieve a balance in the computational work per domain (Bruaset, et al.). In this study, the decomposition is also linked to the multi-color linear solver method because for many cases, the solver dominates the simulator computations. Previous studies showed that decompositions based on graph partitioning, in general, led to poor linear solver performance; therefore, this technique was not considered in this work.  Domain decomposition methods have played a very important role in parallel computing (Killough, et al.). Of the many advantageous features claimed for these methods, the ability to be used on parallel computers is one of the most referred to. In our paper, we will discuss some of the problems in designing and implementing a parallel domain decomposition algorithm by using a parallel reservoir simulator (Nexus® commercial simulator). (Coats, et al., and Shiralkar, et al.) A framework for evaluating the performance of a parallel simulator with one-dimensional and two-dimensional decompositions is developed to answer questions, such as which scenario is the best for a given number of processors and what impact load balancing has on the choice of domain decomposition algorithms. The sources of performance bottlenecks are discussed. The paper starts by describing the new production-quality distributed-memory reservoir simulator (referred to as the simulator), which is used to apply the domain decomposition approaches in our work. Several approaches of domain decompositions for a given number of processors are then applied and analyzed. Finally, case studies show that the framework can select the most efficient domain decomposition scenario for the parallel simulation on a Linux cluster. "

                    "abstract": "Confidently establishing single well and/or aggregated production profiles, particularly estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), is both an important and challenging process in unconventional reservoirs. Numerous papers have proposed forecasting techniques, but four fundamental approaches dominate:  Empirical decline curve analysis (DCA), such as multisegment Arps, the modified stretched exponential production decline (YM-SEPD) model, Duong's method, and power-law methods. Rate-transient analysis (RTA), which can include corrections for special dynamic mechanisms (e.g., stress-sensitivity, multiphase flow, adsorption/desorption). Numerical simulation for history-matching and forward modeling. Volumetrically determining in-place resources based on geological data and then applying a recovery factor deemed suitable for the reservoir system and depletion scheme.  Each of these approaches can be implemented using either probabilistic or single-point estimates. Seidle et al. (2016) recently outlined recommended methodologies to accurately forecast time-series volumes and ultimate recovery in unconventional systems. A key recommendation in Seidle et al. (2016) is that the multiple approaches listed previously should be reconciled to establish confidence in forecasts and ultimate recovery estimates. However, Seidle et al. (2016) does not detail the means to achieve this goal. This paper establishes a methodology/workflow to reconcile the different types of empirical DCA methods, which should serve as a starting point for the ultimate goal of reconciling the four fundamental approaches listed. This paper compares and contrasts the DCA methods applied to various field cases in prominent Canadian [Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB)] and US unconventional (oil and gas) plays (Bakken, Barnett, Cadomin, Eagle Ford, and Niobrara). Data sets are selectively chosen based on data quality and history length to increase confidence in the appraisal of the DCA approach. Hindcasting is applied to validate the results and conclusions. From analysis of a number of wells in different types of reservoirs, a new workflow (methodology) is proposed and validated with hindcasting that allows practically and accurately reconciling EURs based on various empirical methods. This manuscript is the first paper to discuss systematic reconciliation of EURs from varying approaches for horizontal wells in tight/shale reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Due to the advent of shale reservoirs as important sources of oil and gas production, there has been a critical need for reliable techniques for forecasting production and estimating reserves from these plays. This work presents the results of a study to determine whether simple decline models can be used to forecast production and estimate reserves of both oil and gas in liquid rich shale (LRS) reservoirs with reasonable accuracy. We found that hybrid models (i.e., one model such as the Duong model for transient flow coupled with a different model, such as the Arps hyperbolic model with an appropriate value of the parameter “b”) are appropriate for forecasting oil production and that it is possible to forecast solution gas production with availability of adequate data. To establish the “truth case” for comparison, we simulated production with four different reservoir fluids using a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. We tested a variety of hybrid and simple DCA models on simulated data (and later on field data) with a work flow that included identifying flow regimes with diagnostic plots for each fluid sample. We analyzed 0.5–3 years of production history to estimate model parameters for forecasting future production. Also, we forecasted gas production using a technique similar to one recently presented in the literature. Lengthy transition periods between transient linear flow and boundary dominated flow (BDF) were observed on the diagnostic plots. This is presumably due to multi-phase flow effects, as this transition period is typically much shorter in single-phase shale reservoirs. As in single-phase flow, the Arps decline model proved to be good for forecasting in the BDF regime. For transient flow, we examined the Duong model (which includes transient linear flow as a special case) and YM-SEPD (modified form of Stretched Exponential Production Decline model). In some cases, we applied the Arps model for both the transition period and BDF regimes (with different b values). We concluded that hybrid DCA models are more appropriate for multi-phase flow analysis than simple DCA models. In most of the cases, the hybrid YM-SEPD and Arps models led to more accurate oil production forecasts than other alternatives. Our analyses of solution gas forecasts indicated that solution gas production forecasting is possible but there is still need for more research in this area. "

Our goal was to develop a method based on a probabilistic approach to identify, characterize, and better model well production based on standard decline models To attempt to answer this question, we first obtained data for 68 wells in the Greater Core of the Eagle Ford Shale, Texas. As process, we eliminated the wells that did not have enough production data, wells that did not show a production decline and wells that had too much data noise, leaving eight wells. We then performed decline curve analysis (DCA) using the Modified Hyperbolic (MH) and Power-Law Exponential (PLE) models (the two most common DCA models), consisting in user-guided analysis software. Then, the Bayesian paradigm was implemented to calibrate the same two models on the same set of wells. The primary focus of the research was the implementation of the Bayesian paradigm on the eight-well data set. We first performed a \"best fit\" parameter estimation using least squares optimization, which provided an optimized set of parameters for the two decline models. This was followed by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration of the Bayesian posterior function for each model, which provided a full probabilistic description of its parameters. This allowed for the simulation of a number of likely realizations of the decline curves, from which first order statistics were computed to provide a confidence metric on the calibration of each model as applied to the production data of each well. Results showed variation on the calibration of the MH and PLE models. The forward models (MH and PLE) overestimated the ultimate recovery in the majority of the wells compared with the Bayesian calibrations, proving that the Bayesian paradigm was able to capture a more accurate trend of the data and thus able to determine more accurate estimates of reserves. In industry, the same decline models are used for unconventional wells as for conventional wells, even though we know that the same models may not apply. Based on the proposed results, we believe that Bayesian inference yields more accurate estimates of ultimate recovery for unconventional reservoirs than deterministic DCA methods. Moreover, it provides a measure of confidence on the prediction of production as a function of varying data and varying decline models. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate production performance evaluation and forecasting in shales during the early stages of development can play an important role in minimizing uncertainties associated with unconventional reservoirs. Given the limited reliability in forecasts from traditional decline models when applied to unconventional reservoirs, new tools to supplement the ones in use today are required to improve the accuracy of production forecasts. In this study, we present a method involving principal component analysis (PCA), which is a simple, non-parametric method of extracting relevant information from large data sets to perform production forecasting of liquid rich shale gas condensate reservoirs. We used a comprehensive compositional reservoir model to create several iterations of synthetic production histories from liquid rich shales (LRS) wells based on Monte Carlo simulation with predefined probability distributions. Cumulative gas, gas rate, and condensate-to-gas ratio (CGR) for the simulated cases were decomposed into principal component (PC) scores and coefficients were used to recreate the original data. The dataset was cross-validated to check its ability to predict the missing production data based on PC scores and coefficients of the limited production data. Principal component analysis was further applied to the field data from several wells from Eagle Ford shale. We re-created and cross-validated the field data by using limited PC which led to good matches of the original production data. Two to three PC's were required to recreate the initial data with reasonable accuracy depending on the quality of the input data. During the validation step, we observed that some of the wells exhibited significant error which could be attributed to significantly different production profiles of those wells compared to the other wells. For simulated data, four PC was enough to yield the prediction with average error of 0.16%, 0% and 0.77% respectively for gas rate, cumulative gas and CGR respectively. For field data, three PC yielded the best prediction with average error of 1.63% and 2.98% for gas rate and oil rate respectively. This work shows that multivariate statistics and data driven methods can be used as an important approach to complement existing tools like reservoir simulation and decline curve analysis to perform production data analysis. PCA can also be used and can generate accurate results relatively quickly. We recognize that even more rapid approximate methods will be required for routine analysis. Understanding the limitations of different approximate methods and application of methods to overcome these limitations in given circumstances should lead to optimal use of these methods. "

                    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Bayesian decline curve methodology, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and a novel empirical decline curve equation (Zhang et al., 2015) to better quantify uncertainty in estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for oil shales. The methodology was calibrated using hindcasting of production data from an area of the Eagle Ford oil window. Hindcasting, on an areal basis with 254 wells has demonstrated good results, with a coverage rate of true reserves of 78% for an 80% confidence interval (P90-P10) or 199 of the 254 wells tested. The novelty of the new model is in the implementation of the empirical decline curve equation for shale wells in Bayesian decline curve analysis with fast per well solution time on typical engineering computers This method offers many benefits. Principally, the method quantitatively assesses uncertainty and avoids subjective estimates of uncertainty. The results the method generates are accurate for shale wells because the decline curve equation was empirically designed for such wells. Furthermore, it generates replicable results for given wells regardless of the forecasting engineer and offers a fast calculation time of 5-10 seconds per well in the data set. The novel decline curve equation used in this methodology accommodates both early steep rate decline and later shallower decline with a smooth transition. Coupled with a Bayesian decline curve analysis process, the decline behavior of shale wells was assessed probabilistically with accuracy. The decline curve parameters are random variables with defined prior distributions. A MCMC simulation was performed to obtain the posterior distribution of well EUR's. Wells in the sample set had >36 months of production with the first 12 months used as simulation input. The method was calibrated (hindcasted) on an areal basis by measuring the coverage rate of \"true reserves.\" The method, when applied to the Eagle Ford oil shale production data, demonstrated good convergence to stationary posterior distributions of the parameters. This is important because field development of the Eagle Ford and other shale plays is improved when uncertainty is accurately quantified. By quantifying uncertainty and moving away from deterministic decline curve analysis using equations designed for conventional reservoirs, a better understanding of shale well EUR and behavior throughout a play is obtained.

                    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present a new method for estimating producing gas-oil ratios and solution gas production from shale volatile oil reservoirs. In order to enhance our knowledge about the production mechanisms of shale oil reservoirs and possibly better exploit their economic potential, it is important for us to be able to forecast production of the secondary phase – gas. First, we simulated 30 years' production with different reservoir fluids using a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. We then analyzed producing gas-oil ratio data from several representative oil wells using principal components analysis (PCA). With the aid of the Principal Components Methodology (PCM), the principal components obtained from the analyses were used to forecast gas-oil ratios from wells with production histories ranging from 0.5 to 3 years and results were compared to simulated data. We then calculated the cumulative solution gas production from the estimated producing gas-oil ratios. Stakeholders often focus on oil forecasts for shale oil reservoirs, ignoring the important solution gas produced from these plays. Limited production data, complex flow mechanisms in liquid-rich shale reservoirs, patterns of producing gas-oil ratios and other factors, make the task of forecasting solution gas production difficult. Principal components analysis (PCA) has enabled us to reveal the internal structure of data from the representative wells considered, in a way that best describes the variance in the data. This allowed us to get principal components (data from the PCA calculations) that helped us forecast gas-oil ratios from shale volatile oil reservoirs using the Principal Components Methodology (PCM). We were able to estimate producing gas-oil ratios and solution gas production with reasonable accuracy. This work presents a unique and novel approach of forecasting production from liquid rich shale plays. It can help to improve reserves estimation, reservoir management and project economics. "

Forecasting production from unconventional, low permeability reservoirs is particularly challenging. As a contribution to the ongoing efforts of finding solutions to this problem, this paper presents a new method of forecasting production from liquid rich shale reservoirs called the Principal Components Methodology (PCM). In our study, we simulated production of fluids with different compositions for 30 years with the aid of a commercial compositional simulator. We then applied the Principal Components Methodology (PCM) to the production data from several representative wells by using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to calculate the principal components. These principal components were then used to forecast oil production from wells with production histories ranging from 0.5 to 3 years, and the results were compared to simulated data. Application of the PCM to field data is also included in this work. Various factors ranging from ultra-low permeability to multi-phase flow effects have plagued the mission of forecasting production from liquid rich shale reservoirs. Traditional decline curve analysis (DCA) methods have not been completely adequate for estimating production from shale reservoirs. The PCM method enables us to obtain the production decline structure that best captures the variance in the data from the representative wells considered. This new technique eliminates the need for parameters like the hyperbolic decline exponents (b values) and the task of switching from one DCA model to another. It also allows us to forecast production without necessarily using diagnostic plots. With PCM, we were able to forecast oil production from shale reservoirs with reasonable certainty. This study presents an innovative and simple method of forecasting production from shale reservoirs. It provides fresh insights into how estimating production can be done in a different way. "

                    "abstract": "Over the last few years, the hydrocarbon production from shale plays has grown dramatically around the world. These unconventional resources have presented many challenges to the oil and gas industry. One of the biggest challenges for evaluators is to predict long-term shale production performance, especially in a timely and reliable manner. For traditional reservoirs, the most common practice of reserve evaluation is Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), a method with decided advantages; it is not only the simplest and least time-consuming method, but it also accommodates the historical field uncertainties by honoring observed performance trends. However, applying the traditional DCA method to shale wells, engineers commonly encounter the difficulties of simultaneously matching the high initial production rate, the extremely sharp decline rate in the transient flow period, and the shallow decline resulting from boundary-dominated flow (BDF) in late-life. This suggests that traditional DCA may not be suitable for evaluating shale reservoirs. As a result, numerical simulation seems to be the best solution to provide reliable results but at the expense of extensive manpower, cost, time, and data requirements. We propose an alternate DCA approach, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional DCA or numerical simulation, to estimate the recoverable hydrocarbons. We suggest that a mechanism of “growing drainage volume” is an excellent way to conceptualize and model the performance of shale wells. This paper presents a new extended exponential form of the production decline analytical equation. Three empirical depletion terms, βe, βl, and n, have been used in the equation. The parameter βe represents the early, sharp decline in the transient period immediately after the well is put on production; the βl parameter represents the comparatively shallow decline in late-life when the progress of “growing drainage volume” plays the dominant role on the production performance; the parameter n is an empirical exponent. The overall decline rate can be calculated by a relationship involving, βe, βl, n, and time t. Even though the new method is not always more accurate than peer models, it is likely as accurate, and does not require the analyst to guess when to switch to a boundary-dominated flow model nor to force a switch to exponential decline. We have tested and verified this new empirical DCA by both extensive field data and detailed numerical simulation results for seven wells. For each of these data sets, the comparisons between traditional DCA methods, and in some cases simulations, indicate the relative advantages of this new approach. Later, we applied this method to over 2000 wells in the Eagle Ford shale. The analysis resulted in a relatively symmetric distribution for the empirical parameter n. "

A simulation model can integrate complex static data, the physical description of displacement processes, production constraints, and schedules. Hence, it can provide important information for business decisions and reserves estimation. Confidence in simulation predictions depends on the strength of evidence for the input data, quality control of the model, robustness of the history match, and whether there is independent evidence supporting predictions. We explain the principles for evaluating a simulation model and propose requirements for simulation predictions to be considered as proved reserves. This involves evaluation against different strands of evidence, such as static and dynamic characterization, wells and facilities description, reservoir performance, and analogs. Simulation models are often built to support business decisions by use of the best technical estimates for inputs. There can be instances where a simulation model may be reasonable and reliable but it only represents a “best technical” outcome. There may not be sufficient evidence to count the whole predicted recovery as proved reserves. We propose how such a model may be modified to also provide proved-reserves estimates. The approach can be used with different available data and at different stages of field life. It is illustrated through a case study that shows how the principles may be applied. "

                    "abstract": "The objective of the study summarized in this paper was to establish a robust method to detect outliers in rate and pressure data used for decline analysis and forecasting, pressure and rate transient analysis, and similar workflows. Presence of outliers contributes significantly to the uncertainty and non-uniqueness associated with the rate/pressure transient analysis workflow. In time-series data usually encountered in rate/pressure transient analysis workflows, we observed that the neighboring data points of an inlying data point will be closer to the point as compared to closeness of an outlier data point. The outlier detection method we developed exploits this observation. It relies on the concept of local density around a data point, and locality is quantified by a function of distance of the data point from its k-nearest neighbors. This concept further maps into a local outlier factor, which signifies the quantitative extent of a data point being an outlier. Outliers will have a higher value of local outlier factor than will inlying data points. A threshold value of local outlier factor is used to label the data points as outliers, and this threshold is set using the histogram of local outlier factor values. Most commonly used outlier detection methods in the industry assume that rate/pressure data follow a known model (e.g., a Gaussian probability distribution model), but outliers deviate strongly from this model. In the usual parametric-model-based approach, an a priori assumption of the correct model needs to be verified, which can limit the validity of the approach. The newly proposed outlier detection method, being non-parametric, is more robust as it is independent of the assumption that data follows a known model. We present a synthetic case study demonstrating the importance of outlier detection and outlining the limitations of currently used outlier detection methods. We then validate our method through synthetic examples generated using numerical models of multi-stage hydraulically fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs. Upon validation we demonstrate application of our method using field examples from four major shale plays. "

These ‘corrected’ rate data can then be analyzed with confidence to determine parameters in decline models or to use in more general rate-transient analysis. Current methods used in the industry to correct for the effects of variable BHP, such as pressure-normalized rates and material-balance time, lead to less accurate model-parameter determination and thus to less accurate forecasts of future production. We propose a new methodology based on Inverse Problem Theory to accurately forecast performance of a reservoir exhibiting variable pressure and rate trends. We first apply a unique deconvolution algorithm to the observed rate and pressure data; this deconvolved rate response represents the true decline model response if the bottomhole pressure remained constant throughout the production history. We then use the deconvolved rate response to estimate decline model parameters (like Arps decline parameter \"b\", loss-ratio and derivative of loss ratio) using standard curve fitting techniques. We then convolve this rate decline model with the proposed future pressure decline to obtain an accurate forecast of reservoir performance. We pose this deconvolution problem as a regularized and weighted least square problem; the novelty in our approach lies in the regularization and weighting strategy we propose. We have overcome the limitations due to the poor quality of production data (as compared to well test data) by proposing an unsupervised weighting scheme based on a local outlier factor. We validate our method with synthetic examples generated using numerical models of multi-stage hydraulically fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs. We then illustrate application of our method using field examples from four major shale plays. Our work demonstrates that this new methodology of integrating pressures into decline curve analysis is theoretically and practically more robust than the analysis of pressure normalized rate data currently used to solve the problem.

This work presents the results of a study to determine whether simple decline models can be used to forecast production and estimate reserves of both oil and gas in shale volatile oil reservoirs with reasonable accuracy. We found that hybrid models (i.e., one model such as the Duong model for transient flow coupled with a different model, such as the Arps hyperbolic model with an appropriate value of the parameter \"b\") are appropriate for forecasting oil production and that it is possible to forecast solution gas production with availability of adequate data. To establish the \"truth case\" for comparison, we simulated production with four different reservoir fluids using a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. We tested a variety of hybrid and simple DCA models on simulated data (and later on field data) with a work flow that included identifying flow regimes with diagnostic plots for each fluid sample. We analyzed 0.5 to 3 years of production history to estimate model parameters for forecasting future production. Also, we forecasted gas production using a technique similar to one recently presented in the literature. Lengthy transition periods between transient linear flow and boundary dominated flow (BDF) were observed on the diagnostic plots. This is presumably due to multi-phase flow effects, as this transition period is typically much shorter in single-phase shale reservoirs. As in single-phase flow, the Arps decline model proved to be good for forecasting in the BDF regime. For transient flow, we examined the Duong model (which includes transient linear flow as a special case) and YM-SEPD (modified form of Stretched Exponential Production Decline model). In some cases, we applied the Arps model for both the transition period and BDF regimes (with different b values). We concluded that hybrid DCA models are more appropriate for multi-phase flow analysis than simple DCA models. In most of the cases, the hybrid YM-SEPD and Arps models led to more accurate oil production forecasts than other alternatives. Our analyses of solution gas forecasts indicated that solution gas production forecasting is possible but there is still need for more research in this area. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a study of how the oil and gas industry has approached the demonstration of a \"Reliable Technology\" since the emergence of this as a formal reserves term in the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) modernized reserves regulations in late 2008. The paper summarizes the different technologies and the approach to reliability demonstration described in recent technical literature. It also investigates the target element of the reserves estimation procedure, such as expanding the Proved Area. Through a review of published technical papers and other documents, this paper examines the industry's different views of demonstrating a \"reliable technology.\" Sidle and Lee (2010a) proposed the scientific method as an approach to demonstrating the criteria were satisfied. Industry literature examples of seismic technology (to determine Proved Area) and numerical reservoir simulation (to determine recovery factor) are analyzed. Additionally, we examine the SPEE Monograph 3 (2010) procedure to understand the logic used to support reliability and compare it to the scientific method approach. This examination includes how the demonstration of analogy is important to estimate the resulting PUD reserves when technologies to define Proved Area are being considered. This is then compared to other examples of predictable commercial productivity of undrilled areas that do not meet the SPEE Monograph 3 (2010) requirements. As industry seeks new technologies and approaches to demonstrating reliability, the status of how others have addressed these issues is valuable guidance. In providing both recent demonstration approaches and proposed technology, this paper provides a good reference on both what is currently being done to establish a proposed reliable technology and how this technology can be validated.

                    "abstract": "For over 50 years, oil and gas companies in North America have been developing technology to produce from unconventional gas resources. During this time, developments in exploration, drilling, completions, and stimulation have led to what is now called the shale revolution. There are publications in the literature describing the volume of the resources (gas in place) in many of the plays in many of the basins. However, the industry is most interested in how much natural gas can be recovered using state of the art technology, which is called technically recoverable resources. Some publications address technically recoverable resources (TRR) of unconventional gas in small geographic areas in North America. However, there is virtually no information published about the magnitude of TRR for unconventional gas on a global scale. Uncertainty exists in geologic and engineering data and, consequently, in the results of calculations made with these data. The uncertainty of the problem begs for a probabilistic solution. The objective of our work was to determine the distribution of unconventional gas TRR worldwide. To achieve this goal, a computer program, called unconventional gas resource assessment system (UGRAS), was developed. The program integrates a Monte Carlo technique with an analytical reservoir simulator. The combination provides an excellent means to predict production profiles for a wide variety of reservoir characteristics and producing conditions. Using UGRAS, the probabilistic distribution of original gas-in-place, TRR, and recovery factor for selected unconventional gas reservoirs in the United States were established and the representative distribution of recovery factors for those unconventional gas reservoirs were derived. Finally, the distribution of recovery factors gained from the analyses of unconventional gas reservoirs in the United States was extended to estimate global unconventional gas TRR. UGRAS is a robust tool that may be used to evaluate and rank shale gas, tight gas, and coal bed methane (CBM) resources worldwide. Results of this work verify the existence of significant technically recoverable unconventional gas resources worldwide and can guide industry better target its exploitation efforts worldwide. Global CBM TRR was estimated from 500 (P90) to 3000 (P10) trillion cube feet (Tcf). Global tight gas TRR ranges from 37,000 (P90) to 80,000 (P10) Tcf and global shale gas TRR ranges from 4000 (P90) to 24,000 (P10) Tcf. "

                    "abstract": "In the last decade, the hydrocarbon production from shale plays has increased dramatically, which has greatly impacted the petroleum industry. While this increased production has benefited the industry, at the same time these unconventional resources have presented many challenges to oil and gas reserves evaluators. One of these challenges is predicting long-term shale production performance and life, especially in a timely and reliable manner. When Arps derived the hyperbolic model in 1944, b-factor was assumed as a constant and limited to values less than or equal to 1.0. However, many literature papers and field observations have shown that the b-factor instead changes with time in shale wells and, in many cases, can be well above 1.0, especially during the transient period. As a result, evaluators have modified the original DCA (\"modified hyperbolic model\") to incorporate a b-factor larger than 1.0 and a minimum exponential decline rate (Dmin) at the late-time life in shale production predictions. This paper further discusses this transient b-factor effect and the benefits of the Extended Exponential Decline Curve Analysis (EEDCA), (Zhanget. al , 2015). EEDCA does not require an estimate of when to switch to a Boundary-Dominated Flow (BDF) model or when to switch to exponential decline for shale oil and gas. All of the model parameters are interdependent and can be calibrated by fitting from the first production data point. Meanwhile, the Dmin used in the modified hyperbolic model is independent from early-time data. This paper further extends the use of EEDCA by applying it to conventional wells. It shows EEDCA is a useful alternative for the Arps method while it holds certain advantages in forecasting shale production. Thus, EEDCA is an integrated solution for both conventional and unconventional reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional DCA methods, developed for boundary dominated flow (BDF), yield unrealistic values for expected ultimate recovery (EUR) when used for unconventional reservoirs with long-duration transient linear flow. Moreover, the developed model parameters are not functions of reservoir properties and flow mechanisms. Although new models have been developed over the years to predict the linear flow, there is still no good way to forecast long-term performance of gas condensate reservoirs. In this study, we use decline curve analysis, reservoir simulation and statistical analysis to understand the flow of hydrocarbons in LRS reservoirs and to estimate the ultimate recovery in LRS gas condensate reservoirs accurately. Initially, a synthetic reservoir model was constructed to replicate a limited case history available for the Eagle Ford Shale. Various sensitivities on reservoir parameters and operating conditions were performed to understand their effect on oil and gas EUR's after 30 years of production using design of experiments (DOE) and response surface modelling (RSM). Various decline curve methods were applied to the synthetic data obtained by using pressure normalized diagnostic plots. Results from this study shows that pressure normalization could potentially be used to identify the flow regimes in LRS reservoirs, which is especially true for rate restricted fields. We also observed that the production characteristics of LRS gas condensate reservoirs are highly variable, possibly due to the change in composition via liquid dropout. The approach of using two or more models with different production parameters by isolating the parameters provides a good fit to the data and a realistic estimate of the EUR. Statistical analysis of the reservoir parameters and the EUR shows that there is some relationship among them. Our study shows that these statistically developed co-relations are accurate for the reservoir studied and EUR for other wells in the same field can be obtained with variation of parameters. We present a methodology which uses empirical decline curve analysis, physics based reservoir simulation and statistical analysis to forecast EUR based on limited production data in LRS gas condensate reservoirs. This study provides considerable insight into the long-term production behavior in LRS gas condensate reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid-rich shale (LRS) volatile oil plays exhibit several challenges to modeling and analyzing such as flattened produced gas oil ratio (GOR), complex phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow influenced by pore proximity effects in nano pores. In this study we investigated multi-phase flow and the governing flow mechanisms in these resources using a new procedure to divide shale matrix into different sub-media and a new methodology to model well performance. We have developed new correlations for modifying PVT properties in nano pores to incorporate the impact of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior. We have subdivided shale matrix into three zones, nano-pores, micro pores, and natural (macro) fractures along with propped fractures with distinctive PVT, rock compaction and relative permeability properties in a compositional simulation model. We have implemented logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (LS-LGR) to track saturation and pressure changes around the hydraulic fracture. Results from our new method were validated against production data from several LRS oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale. Our numerical model reproduced anomalous produced GOR's that have been observed in liquid-rich shale oil wells. The study showed that the main impacts of nano-pore confinement on phase behavior, rock properties and fluid flow are reduction of bubble point, enhancement of critical gas saturation and severe permeability reduction due to compaction. Delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nano-pores causes the \"flat\" GOR's observed in early stages of production. Enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nano-pores and could extend non-intuitive GOR behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point. We found that ultimate oil recovery could change more than 20% by permeability reduction due to compaction. The study revealed that the period of constant produced GOR depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and pore size distribution in the reservoir. For moderate-GOR oil reservoirs, the constant GOR duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs, as well as in reservoirs with a greater percentage of nano pores. The methodology introduced in this study allows us to better model LRS volatile oil wells and to estimate EUR more accurately. These new correlations for modifying bulk PVT properties under confinement combined with numerical models enables reservoir engineers to understand better the complicated physics in LRS volatile oil reservoir performance.

                    "abstract": "This paper summarizes our investigation of production mechanisms and well production performance in liquid-rich shale (LRS) oil wells and introduces a new methodology for modeling LRS oil well performance. It discusses the impact of nanopore confinement on PVT properties, transport properties, rock compaction, how these phenomena affect produced GOR of LRS oil wells, and how to incorporate these phenomena into reservoir modeling studies. The proposed methodology has been applied to construct a compositional simulation model using a hydraulic fracture reservoir model with logarithmically-spaced local grid refinement (LS-LGR grids). We incorporated the impact of nanopore confinement on phase behavior by using new correlations for modifying PVT properties in nanopores. The model was divided into three zones, hydraulic fracture, nanopores, and micro pores; each zone had different PVT, rock compaction and relative permeability properties. Production data from several LRS oil wells in the Eagle Ford shale were used for history matching and model calibration. Our numerical model is able to simulate producing GOR behavior of LRS oil wells accurately. The \"flat\" GOR's in early stages of production are caused by delayed development of two-phase flow as a result of reduction of the bubble point pressure in nanopores. Enhancement of critical gas saturation delays mobilization of gas molecules in nanopores and could extend non-intuitive GOR behavior further when reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point. We found that the impact of permeability reduction due to compaction on ultimate oil recovery could be more than 20%. The study reveals that the period of constant produced GOR depends on the volatility of the reservoir fluid and on the pore size distribution in the reservoir. For moderate-GOR oil reservoirs, the constant GOR duration is greater than for highly volatile oil reservoirs. Several unique phenomena in LRS oil reservoirs were explored in this study. As a result, we were able to introduce new correlations for modifying bulk PVT properties under confinement. These new correlations and the effects of nanopores can be combined with numerical models to simulate the performance of LRS oil reservoirs and to estimate EUR more accurately. We concluded that numerical models with PVT model based on fluid bulk properties are not able to accurately simulate unconventional LRS oil reservoir fluid flow. Confinement impact on PVT and rock-fluid property of nanopores play key roles in complex production behavior of these resources. We also concluded that, for numerical models to capture accurately fluid distribution and compositional variability in nano Darcy LRS oil reservoirs, it is necessary to have correct knowledge of pore/pore throat size distributions in the reservoir.

                    "abstract": "With the recent slump in the price of crude oil, it has become essential to improve the net present value (NPV) of unconventional reservoirs by intelligently down-spacing the horizontal wells with multistage fractures wells. Unconventional Liquid-Rich Shale (LRS) reservoirs, characterized by low permeability, require optimal well density in addition to stimulation for economic viability. Optimally designed multi-well facilities simplify well management and maintenance, prevent overcapitalization by eliminating redundant equipment and increase the overall long-term economic outlook of LRS plays. This paper presents a systematic workflow to identify the best well spacing strategies for liquid rich shale (LRS) plays with multiple fluid gradients and significant multiphase flow. We analyzed the performance of wells with different spacing and fluid composition, ranging from volatile oil to rich gas condensate based on different initial in-situ solution gas oil ratios (GOR). Compositional reservoir simulation was performed on analog wells with drilling and completion techniques similar to several LRS plays to calculate EUR's for different well spacing scenarios. NPV analysis was performed for each case to identify the \"cut-off' range, after which further down-spacing causes a negative NPV, with results varying for differen fluid compositions. The results from the study show that the workflow presented in this paper provides a reliable tool to predict the performance of a various well-spacing conditions in a reservoir with multiphase flow. Well interference increased when well spacing was decreased below a certain threshold value, based on the initial fluid composition and other reservoir parameters. The wells cannibalized each other when they were too closely spaced resulting in lower per-well production. Furthermore, the increase in final cumulative production was negligible beyond a certain well spacing, making it economically unappealing. For gas condensates, reduced well spacing beyond a certain value showed a detrimental effect on final cumulative condensate production due to larger amounts of condensate dropout. We can conclude from the results that increases in NPV of LRS reservoirs require a careful implementation of optimal well spacing based on initial fluid and reservoir conditions. This paper demonstrates that LRS reservoirs need optimal well spacing for optimum production and favorable NPV. It also provides a reliable methodology to identify proper well spacing for improved overall recovery based on different reservoir and fluid conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Arps' decline model was developed for the boundary dominated flow (BDF) regime that is reached quickly in conventional reservoirs. Without modification, the Arps model does not work well for unconventional reservoirs with long-duration transient flow and variable bottom-hole pressure. This paper presents results of a study of different decline models that are used to forecast production in LRS reservoirs with long-duration transient flow. The study used synthetic future production data generated using reservoir parameters typical of those observed in practice. In traditional DCA, a single curve is fitted to the entire production data without using the historical pressure data. However, the first step in reliable DCA is to identify the different flow regimes using appropriate diagnostic plots and then fitting different flow regimes with different models. This procedure allows us to forecast future production using appropriate decline models. The results from the study show that log-log pressure-normalized vs. time diagnostic plots correctly identify flow regimes in low permeability LRS plays. Pressure normalization removes the confounding effects of multiphase flow and variable pressure and allows us to predict the time at which we need to switch from transient to boundary-dominated-flow (BDF) DCA models. Pressure normalization can be used on rate restricted wells which would otherwise be not possible using only rate data. Hybrid models, in which early transient linear flow is fitted by models like Duong, or SEPD, followed by the Arps' decline model during BDF, were significantly more accurate than single-flow-regime models. The results from the study also showed that there is a long transition period between early transient linear flow to BDF due to the onset of multiphase flow. Each flow regime, including the transition flow regime, was modeled by calculating appropriate model parameters from available rate-pressure-time data. Hybrid models forecasted the gas EUR accurately. Condensate production was also estimated by using a method proposed by Yu which led to accurate forecasts for lean gas condensate samples. LRS gas condensate reservoirs have fundamentally different flow behavior than traditional black oil/dry gas reservoirs, and we cannot forecast rates using traditional decline curve analysis without modification. We can use diagnostic plots to select appropriate decline curve methodology based on the type of reservoir fluid. "

                    "abstract": "Development of liquid rich shale (LRS) reservoirs has gained tremendous momentum in recent years. A detailed understanding of fluid behavior, completion practices and reservoir dynamics is essential to accurately predict their long-term performance. This paper uses stochastic reservoir modelling to identify the optimal values for several completion and uncertainty parameters. A compositional reservoir simulation model for a typical gas condensate well in the Eagle Ford shale was used to identify the optimal production strategies for maximum EUR of oil and gas. The important factors considered for the study are fracture spacing, fracture conductivity, fracture half-length, well spacing, porosity, permeability, initial GOR and well constraints. These factors are often studied independently of one another and their interaction is usually ignored. For example, in a higher permeability play, greater fracture density leads to rapid recovery but ultimate cumulative production does not improve. However, for a play with lower permeability, greater fracture density improves both recovery rate and EUR thereby leading to improved overall economics. Thus, interaction effects due to coupling can have a decisive effect on the overall performance of a reservoir. This paper presents a statistical study of both independent and coupled effects on ultimate oil and gas production from a LRS gas condensate reservoir. The results show that fracture half-length and fracture spacing have the most complex and significant effects on performance of the reservoirs studied. High initial rates are often preferred in unconventional reservoirs with their rapid rates of decline. These high rates can be achieved with larger fracture half-lengths and smaller fracture spacing. This study shows that high initial rate of production leads to a greater liquid dropout and larger condensate banking. These results also reduce the production rate of gas due to relative permeability effects. Return on investment is reduced due to reduced cumulative production and excess spending on fracture creation. Similar effects were observed for other factors like well constraints where higher minimum flowing bottom-hole pressure led to lower cumulative gas production and lower liquid dropout. In some cases higher bottom-hole pressure might be preferable due to the differential in the price of condensate and gas. The sensitivity studies in this study provide considerable insight into the long-term production behavior in LRS gas condensate reservoirs. During the initial phase of a project, uncertainties related to various field parameters and their coupled effects are often ignored leading to suboptimal returns on investment. "

                    "title": "Undeveloped Reserves and the Five-Year Time Limit: Can Different Interpretations Coexist",
                    "abstract": "A key element in determining a project's commercial maturity is the evidence of a firm intent to proceed with development within a reasonable time frame. The Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) (SPE 2007) recommends 5 years as a benchmark, although a longer time can be applied in some cases. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also provides specific guidance and requirements on undeveloped reserves and the 5-year-maturation time limit. Despite the apparent clarity in the PRMS and SEC regulations regarding project maturity, this paper describes actual examples in the public domain in which different levels of commercial maturity were introduced within a project for proved and probable reserves as a result of the 5-year time limit. This has resulted in projects with their proved reserves reclassified as probable reserves because they will not be developed within the 5-year time limit. This paper reviews SPE standards and SEC wording on commercial maturity requirements and the 5-year time limit, providing clarity on whether a project's recoverable volumes should be classified as reserves or contingent resources if its undeveloped reserves are not matured into developed reserves within 5 years of their first reporting, and specific circumstances for a longer maturation time frame do not exist. When referring to projects with proved undeveloped reserves falling outside the 5-year time limit, the SEC uses different wording throughout the Final Rule document issued in January 2009 (NARA 2009). This has resulted in apparently different interpretations of the requirements for projects to meet this criterion. On the basis of the wording used in SEC forms 10-K and 20-F, public disclosures seem to range from reporting only the projects with undeveloped reserves that have been continuously disclosed for 5 years or more in the annual filings, to reporting all projects that have been or will remain undeveloped for 5 years or more from the time of their first disclosure date. Given the wording in the SEC Final Rule, it is understandable that different interpretations of the regulations may emerge. This paper presents an analysis of the SEC language used in the Final Rule and related wording used in SEC comment letters from the last few years. Failing further clarity from the SEC, this analysis provides the authors' opinion on the clarity required to ensure consistency in the way the SEC 5-year rule should be interpreted and in the spirit of comparability among companies that provides the basis for the SEC requirement to report these undeveloped reserves as a separate item. Another area discussed in this paper relates to the wording used by the SEC regarding a project's undeveloped-reserves volumes (i.e., its undeveloped reserves in barrels of oil equivalent) and the potential different interpretations that the industry may give to the SEC Final Rule. A simple example is presented to provide clarity on the option that is most likely to meet the SEC requirements. Potential inconsistencies resulting from different interpretation are highlighted. The analysis and recommendations presented in this paper aim at creating consistent approaches leading to better comparability among oil and gas companies by use of an aligned interpretation of standards and requirements for reserves estimation, classification, categorization, and disclosure.

                    "title": "Probabilistic Reserves Addition Within a Project",
                    "abstract": "The SPE-Petroleum Resources Management System (2007) (SPEPRMS) is a project-based system in which the project definition and its treatment play key roles in the estimation and categorization of reserves and resources and their range of uncertainty. This is key to capturing the potential downside and upside of the project and the commercial opportunities that may exist. Wrongly defining the project may result in an improper ring-fencing of the elements that one must consider in reserves and resource estimation and in improper risk assessment, with potential for missed opportunities or failure as an outcome. The SPE-PRMS is clear on the type of aggregation that one can use within a field, a property, or a project, with probabilistic addition allowed within each of these entities. However, despite this clarity, and on the basis of information provided in 10-Ks, 20-Fs, and annual reports, most companies in the oil-and-gas industry have not yet adapted their methods to reflect these best practices in external disclosures. The technical literature has devoted significant effort to address technical and commercial issues in probabilistic reserves and resource estimation of a field or incremental activity (e.g., drilling wells). However, very little effort has been devoted to the proper definition of a “project,” its attributes, ring-fencing, uncertainty-assessment approaches for the fields within the project, and in the categorization and aggregation of reserves or resources within the project. Furthermore, downside project economics should capture the true project’s downside (or the true P90 of the project) rather than an overly pessimistic estimate of its proved reserves calculated with arithmetic additions within the project. To describe a simple approach to a project’s reserves estimates, this paper uses an actual liquefied-natural-gas (LNG) project and its reserves estimates, estimated by different companies, with the arithmetic aggregation approach and the probabilistic aggregation approach. This example highlights different interpretations of the existing standards and regulations among joint venture (project) partners within the same project. This paper also highlights the overall impact that the two types of proved-reserves-aggregation methods (arithmetic and probabilistic) may have. In the specific example presented in this paper, the difference between the two methods can account for up to 15% of the project’s proved reserves. One can also use the approach described in other types of projects (e.g., a project with satellite developments by use of common facilities) or resources estimates (e.g., projects in contingent resources), to properly capture the downside risk and realistic upside, uncertainty ranges, and project business opportunities, truly reflecting the project’s reasonable certainty at the P90 level. Gas projects are preferred to illustrate this approach. For gas-commitment purposes, many buyers require the LNG project’s proved (P90) reserves to be independently certified before contractual commitments can be finalized. Underestimation of the project’s true proved reserves may result in loss of opportunities and/or in an overly pessimistic assessment of the proved reserves not reflecting reasonable certainty. Requirements from regulatory bodies [e.g., NARA (SEC) 2009; ESMA 2011] and their linkages to reserves aggregation within a project are also addressed in this paper. In the project analyzed, this underestimation is between 12 and 15% of the project’s proved reserves, depending on the year of disclosure. "

                    "abstract": "Lease fuel (also called fuel gas, fuel consumed in operations or lease-used gas) is defined by the SPE/WPC/AAPG/SEG/SPEE-Petroleum Resource Management System (SPE-PRMS) as “that portion of produced natural gas, crude oil, or condensate consumed as fuel in production and lease plant operations.” Reporting this “fuel” as reserves, usually with a clear reference to the reserves attributed to these volumes, has been a practice commonly used by many companies, but not by all. Differences exist within a country and between countries regarding the application and interpretation of the existing standards and regulations concerning the reporting of lease fuel as reserves, resulting in a lack of consistency and comparability between oil and gas companies in the reserves externally disclosed. Annual reports, 10-K and 20-F forms of oil and gas companies indicate that, during the last few years, significant volumes of additional reserves are still being added as a result of including, for the first time, the fuel Consumed in Operations (CiO) in the disclosed reserves. These volumes can be material. Based on the companies reviewed, these volumes can represent up to 12% of the company’s total proved reserves, depending on the amount of produced hydrocarbon products consumed as fuel, the type of processes used (e.g., normal production of oil and gas, LNG processing, electricity generation, compression needs, etc.) and the location of the terminal point (SEC terminology) or reference point (SPE-PRMS terminology). A review of definitions, apparent misaligned standards (e.g., SPE-PRMS, Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH)) and requirements from regulatory bodies (Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), UK London Stock Exchange (LSE-AIM), European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA), Australian (ASX), Hong Kong (HKEx) and Singapore (SGX) Stock Exchanges) are discussed in this paper. Examples are also presented with the rationale of why these “lease fuel” volumes should be part of the reported reserves and should include proper narrative on these volumes. Updates of the lease fuel definition and references to lease fuel in the SPE-PRMS are also suggested in this paper, in order to reflect that, during the last few years, many countries and/or regulators have adopted the SPE-PRMS as the estimation and classification standard for reserves and resources, as well as the increasing amount of large integrated energy intensive projects (some of them presently in the undeveloped reserves category), and the increased relevance of unconventional resources and their role in lease fuel. Inconsistencies in the approach to report (or not) the “lease fuel” as reserves are addressed, highlighting the need for clarity in the standards and disclosures being applied to ensure proper transparency, consistent valuation and reporting within the industry in the area of lease fuel, allowing proper comparability. Introduction Different names are used in the industry when referring to produced hydrocarbons “used” as fuel by a company (or consortium of companies) within its projects/lease/fields’ operations. The SPE-PRMS refers to this “used” fuel as lease fuel, while others refer to it as fuel gas, fuel consumed in operations or lease-used gas. For simplicity purposes this paper will use the term “fuel Consumed in Operations” or “fuel CiO” in short, when referring to hydrocarbons that are, after being produced, immediately “used” for consumption by the producing company. In this paper fuel CiO is used to refer to either gas consumption, solid fuel consumption (e.g., bitumen) or liquid fuel consumption, although we recognize that the most widely type of fuel CiO is gas. Some examples are given using gas in order to provide context to the issue being discussed. "

                    "abstract": "With the emergence of liquid rich shale (LRS) plays like Eagle Ford and Northern Barnett, the petroleum industry needs a simple, easily applied technique that provides reliable estimates of future production rates in this kind of reservoir. There is no guarantee that methodology that has proved to work in gas reservoirs will necessarily be appropriate in LRS reservoirs. In this work, we found that without corrections of early data, the Stretched Exponential Production Decline (SEPD) model, designed for transient flow, usually produces pessimistic forecasts of future production. The Duong method, another transient model, may be reasonable during long term transient linear flow, but notably optimistic after boundary-dominated flow (BDF) appears. For wells in BDF, the Arps model provides reasonable forecasts, but the Arps model may not be accurate when applied to transient data. A hybrid of early transient and later BDF models proves to be a reasonable solution to the forecasting problem in LRS. In addition, use of diagnostic plots (like log-log rate-time and log-log rate-material balance time plots) improves confidence in flow regime identification and production forecasting. In some LRS's, BDF is observed within 12 months. In any case, it is essential to identify or to estimate the time to reach BDF and to discontinue use of transient flow models after BDF appears or is expected. We validated our methodology using \"hindcast analysis\"; that is, matching the first half of production history to determine model parameters, then forecasting the second half of history and comparing to observed production data. We also found that application of pressure-corrected rates in decline curve analysis (DCA) may substantially improve the interpretation of data from unconventional oil wells flowing under unstable operating conditions. Fetkovich (hydraulically fractured well) type curve analysis can be added to improve confidence in flow regime identification from diagnostic plots and to estimate the Arps hyperbolic exponent b from the matching b stem on the type curve, which can then be extrapolated to determine estimated ultimate recovery.

                    "abstract": "Due to their simplicity, empirical production forecasting methods have been used by the petroleum industry for decades.  Since 2008, a number of empirical methods have been introduced to the petroleum industry, specifically for wells located in tight/shale reservoirs.  However, most of these new methods are not reliable for forecasting remaining reserves, although they may appear to be very good for forecasting EUR in wells in which a high percentage of the EUR has already been produced. The Stretched Exponential Production Decline (SEPD) Method was introduced in 2010.  Our results from analysis of both synthetic and actual field data by using SEPD have indicated that this method will most likely underestimate EUR in reservoirs with permeability ranging from 0.1mD to 0.0001mD.  A modified SEPD (YM-SEPD) Method has therefore been developed to eliminate the SEPD Method's shortcoming by employing a new specialized plot to find all related parameters. This newly developed method is very easy to use and, most importantly, it will yield a much more reliable production and remaining reserve prediction for tight horizontal wells.  With longer production histories, remaining reserves can be forecasted even more accurately and with a high confidence level. Hundreds of horizontal wells including oil wells from various formations (Cadomin, Montney, Notikewin, Cardium, Barnett Shale, Muskwa, etc.), hydraulically fractured in various ways, have been analyzed using the modified SEPD (YM-SEPD) method.  Results indicate that reliable EURs and production profiles can be predicted readily for wells having only two to three years of production history.  For wells having less than two years of production history, the modified SEPD (YM-SEPD) Method can also yield reasonable production forecasts when coupled with Duong's empirical method. This paper presents the application of the modified SEPD (YM-SEPD) Method to a number of actual and synthetic oil and gas wells to estimate their proved reserves, including horizontal wells producing dry, wet and retrograde gas as well as tight oil. These examples have had production histories with either observed or non-observed boundary-dominated flow (BDF). The examples also illustrate how the modified SEPD (YM-SEPD) method is capable of estimating proven reserves with high confidence. "

                    "abstract": "Current practice of well placement in tight gas reservoirs generally involves the use of empirical correlations based on reservoir properties and analysis of past production histories and/or pressure maps from flow simulation. No rigorous procedure is available to compute well drainage volumes in the presence of heterogeneity controlled by the distribution and orientation of natural fractures. The situation is complicated by the routine use of complex wells in tight gas reservoirs and the presence of multistage hydraulic fractures. The computation of drainage volume will be critical to our understanding of the interaction between existing wells, potential infill locations and the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) computations. We propose a rigorous approach for well drainage volume calculations in tight gas reservoirs based on the flux field derived from dual porosity finite-difference simulation and demonstrate its application to optimize well placement. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front’ along gas streamlines. The proposed approach is a generalization of the radius of drainage concept in well test analysis (Lee, 1982). The method allows us not only to compute rigorously the well drainage volumes as a function of time but also examine the potential impact of infill wells on the drainage volumes of existing producers. Using these results, we present a systematic approach to optimize well placement to maximize the EUR. We demonstrate the power and utility of our method using both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is used to validate our approach by establishing consistency between the drainage volume calculations from streamlines and the EUR computations based on detailed finite-difference simulations. We also present comparison of our approach with analytic drainage volume calculations for simplified cases. Finally, we present a field example whereby we utilize the streamline-based drainage volumes to identify depleted sands and generate a reservoir ‘depletion capacity’ map to optimize infill well placement based on the undepleted and undrained regions. The field application clearly demonstrates a systematic approach to optimal well placement in tight gas reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "There is a huge demand in the industry to forecast production in shale gas reservoirs accurately. There are many production estimation methods including several variations of decline curve analysis (DCA), analytical simulation, and numerical simulation. Each one of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, but only the DCA techniques can use readily available production data to forecast rapidly and, to some extent, accurately. Traditional DCA methods in use in the industry, particularly Arps' decline model, were originally been developed for wells in boundary Dominated Flow (BDF). By contrast, in shale reservoirs, the dominant flow regime is long-duration transient flow. Therefore, the petroleum industry needed to develop newer models to match data in transient flow regimes and then for forecast production using these transient flow models, followed, in necessary, by BDF models. The Stretched Exponential model, the Duong model and the Arps model with a minimum terminal decline rate all have the ability to match and forecast wells with transient flow followed by BDF. In this paper we propose revisions to the Duong model, to provide better fits to data in BDF regimes. A thorough analysis of actual well production and analytical simulation results were performed on selected wells in gas shales to compare the various DCA models to ascertain the model that provides the lowest discrepancy in estimates of remaining reserves. Individual well and grouped well analyses were performed to check the efficacy of the various models. We concluded that, in most cases, the newer decline models, such as the Duong method and its modifications, provide more accurate estimates of reserves for individual and grouped data sets than the Arps decline methods. The outcome of this research should assist the industry to forecast gas production rapidly and more accurately in shale reservoirs. The grouped data methodology will enable us to forecast production in shale reservoirs even more rapidly. The grouped data approach will prove to be especially valuable when only limited data are available from wells with less than a few months of production history. "

A previous paper (Sidle and Lee 2010) described an approach to the demonstration that a technology satisfied the criteria of a reliable technology. This paper builds on the use of the scientific method, as described in the previous paper, by examining a real-life example of seismic interpretation to define water contacts downdip of hydrocarbon-column penetrations. Complex technologies, such as seismic, require careful and detailed calibration and testing to demonstrate the consistency and repeatability needed to qualify as a reliable technology. However, this complexity need not preclude that technology from use as reliable. Proper analysis of the science behind the technology and testing to demonstrate those circumstances that allow reliable conclusions from the technology will permit even a complex technology to be qualified as acceptable. The example used is from the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) deep water. It gives the results from several turbidite sand reservoirs in multiple fields to demonstrate the conditions under which certain seismic can be shown as reliable. The learnings from these applications allow the development of a \"reliability qualification checklist\" that defines the conditions under which the seismic data are definitive. Then, it describes the final testing of the \"reliable data\" to determine when a seismically interpreted water contact is sufficiently conclusive to be reasonably certain. This paper will provide a useful description of how the qualification of a technology can be planned, tested, and conclusions drawn. It will provide examples of constraints that develop from the theoretical analysis and testing results and show how these constraints can be incorporated into a set of limitations on the application of the technology. While certain elements of the technology are discussed in this paper, it is not the authors' intent to provide an exhaustive description of the seismic theory and methods used for this example. Rather, the paper will focus on the reliability demonstration process. "

                    "abstract": "The concept of radius of investigation is fundamental to well test analysis and is routinely used to design well tests and to understand the reservoir volume investigated. The radius of investigation can also be useful in identifying new well locations and planning, designing and optimizing hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It has additional implications in estimating reserves and understanding stimulated reservoir volumes. There are many definitions of radius of investigation in the literature and Kuchuk (2009) summarized them recently. Although these definitions vary in detail, they all relate to the propagation of a pressure disturbance or impose thresholds on detectable pressure or rate changes. In this article we will focus on the definition proposed by Lee (1982). Lee defines the radius of investigation as the propagation distance of the “peak” pressure disturbance for an impulse source or sink. For simplified flow geometries and homogeneous reservoir conditions, the radius of investigation can be calculated analytically. However, such analytic solutions are severely limited for heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, particularly for unconventional reservoirs with multistage hydraulic fractures. Generalization of the Concept How can we generalize the concept of radius of investigation to heterogeneous reservoir conditions including unconventional reservoirs with horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fractures? For such general situations, it will be more appropriately called “the depth of investigation” rather than the radius of investigation. The simplest, not necessarily the most desirable, approach will be to use a numerical reservoir simulator. For example, we can simulate a constant rate drawdown test and observe the pressure response at every grid block in the simulation model. It is as if, we have distributed sensors throughout the reservoir. We can now compute the time derivative of the pressure at each grid block and note the time when the derivative reaches a maximum. We can then simply contour this “peak” arrival time at every grid block. Note that because the constant rate test corresponds to a step function (from 0 to Q), its derivative is an impulse function. Thus, by contouring the arrival time of the maximum of the pressure derivative, we are actually looking at the arrival time of the maximum of an impulse response as defined by Lee (1982). How well does the approach work? Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the radius of investigation for homogeneous radial flow using Lee’s analytic solution. Fig. 1b shows the radius of investigation obtained from numerical simulation. We have superimposed the analytic solution (black lines) on the results from the numerical simulation. We do see a close correspondence, although the numerical results have difficulties resolving the pressure transients away from the well. In spite of its limitations, the numerical approach is very general and can be applied to arbitrary reservoir and well conditions. The computation time and expenses, however, make the numerical simulation approach unfeasible for routine applications. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper is the third paper in a three part series which collectively presents a new practical method for probabilistic reserve evaluation under the recently released Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (SEC 2009). This paper is focused on a methodology to validate the new stochastic booking method outlined in the first two papers of the series. When major changes are contemplated for key systems within a company it is critical to evaluate those changes prior to implementation. Moving to a new method of reserve evaluation and reporting could potentially have major implications for almost any oil and gas company. Internal uses of the reserve report as well as legal requirements of disclosure to regulatory agencies and governing bodies elevates the need to understand the scope of the modifications before they are adopted.  This paper presents an approach wherein the evaluator can test the proposed probabilistic methods against the actual field data. The test is used to predict the repeatability and reliability of the results. In essence, it applies an empirical apporach to insure the technique meets the SEC requirement to be considered a reliable technology. When this approach is conducted over independent units of time and distinct spatial areas the repeatability of the answers supports the robustness and confidence needed to meet the requirements of the Modernized Rules.  Theoretical Proved Undeveloped (PUD) bookings were created using the new stochastic method for specific locations for a prior time period; those results were compared to actual post production proved developed producing (PDP) well estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) results for the same locations. Results for a specific case history are presented. The PDP results are in aggregate slightly greater than the aggregated PUD bookings. The new method constitutes a reliable technology and this paper outlines an approach to test the method prior to implementation in a company's work flow.  Introduction In January 2009, the United States Security and Exchange Commission (SEC 2009) adopted revisions to the oil and gas reporting disclosure rules that included expanded definitions to allow entities to disclose reserves using probabilistic methods. The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting rules do not require the use of probabilistic methods for the evaluation of reserves but does provide the required guidelines if and when probabilistic methods are used. Following the new method outlined in paper one and paper two for Proved Undeveloped (PUD) locations provides reserve values that constitute a reliable technology as well as insuring reasonable certainty standards are achieved. A reliable technology is one that establishes a uniform standard of reasonable certainty that applies to all proved reserves, regardless of location or distance from producing wells. It is imperative that the effects of the method be tested prior to implementation because of the potential negative consequence a significant downward correction in reserves could have on a company and on shareholder perceptions.

                    "title": "Reservoir Simulation: A Reliable Technology",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Under pre-2009 SEC reserves reporting guidance, filers with the SEC had difficulty in persuading the SEC staff that reservoir simulation met the ‘reasonable certainty' standards required to classify resources as proved reserves. With the modernization of the SEC's reserves reporting rules, 'reliable technology,' including computational methods, is allowed to establish the certainty level required for reporting reserves of any category. However, important questions arise: can we consider reservoir simulation to be a reliable technology? If so, what conditions must be satisfied to establish reliability? This paper concludes that simulation is indeed a potential reliable technology when we can demonstrate that it satisfies the criteria of consistency and repeatability, difficult criteria to satisfy for a computational method. The paper also concludes that the reserves analyst can demonstrate when simulation is reliable by proceeding through the steps in the scientific method outlined by Sidle and Lee (2010a) which provide guidelines to establish that a particular technology in question is consistent with the definition of a reliable technology.  At the reasonable certainty level required for proved reserves, we must demonstrate with empirical evidence that estimates of EUR based on simulation are much more likely than not to increase or remain constant as more historical data become available. For 2P (proved plus probable) reserves, we must demonstrate that EUR forecasts are as likely as not as more reservoir performance data become available, and for 3P reserves, EUR forecasts must remain possible though not likely. Empirical evidence that the required level of certainty has been achieved can come from either ‘hind-casting' (successfully predicting the future based on only a portion of historical data) or from demonstrated success from applying the same simulation technology in analogous reservoirs, in which the same level of rigor was applied to ensure that the geological model or models used as the basis for simulation is appropriate and that it honors all available information.  When the industry broadly accepts reservoir simulation as a reliable technology (when applied appropriately) suitable for use in reserves disclosures and when it provides persuasive arguments about reliability to regulatory agencies, the interests of all stakeholders in reserves disclosure efforts will be enhanced.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Historically, oil and gas reserves definitions have included the term \"reasonable certainty?? when describing the standard of high confidence/low uncertainty for a conservative estimate of future recovery from an accumulation. In 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), one source for such definitions and regulations, changed its rules on oil and gas reserves, and moved from a more rules-based approach to a more principles-based approach. While the SEC regulations both before and after this change incorporated the term \"reasonable certainty??, the philosophical change from rules-based to principles-based regulation puts more responsibility on the reserves evaluator to understand the uncertainties in the reserves estimation and to \"get it right??.  This paper examines the stated definition of reasonable certainty as well as the effective definition based on how the regulations were interpreted under the prior rules-based system. Examples of prior methods of regulatory controls, under a rules-based system, that no longer fit under a principles-based system are noted. The paper then examines the current definition. The overprint of a principles-based regulatory system must be considered to understand how such an approach will impact the effective definition under the current rules. The insights from the financial and legal communities are examined for their learnings where other forms of regulations underwent this same philosophical change. This examination describes how rules-based systems are more \"input control?? focused, while principles-based systems focus more on \"outcomes??.  Next the paper suggests how the reserves evaluator should apply this understanding of the new principles-based rules. The evaluator is now more responsible to understand the range of uncertainty in reserves estimates and to ensure that the outcome (the proved reserves estimate) satisfies the regulations. Also the paper discusses key tests to demonstrate that the correct outcome, a reasonably certain volume, has been achieved. After 30 years of well-established practices, the responsible reserves evaluator has examined changes as they evolved in then-current regulation text. Now the evaluator needs to additionally consider changes based on the implications of principles-based regulations.  A history of \"reasonable certainty?? There are few terms as ancient or pervasive as \"reasonable certainty?? throughout the history of oil and gas reserves definitions. Yet each time the reserves definitions or classification systems change, we should revisit this term to place it in the context of those changes. "

This background information will include criteria that reliabletechnology must meet to ensure that it will provide the confidence levelrequired to categorize certain resources as reserves of any category (proved,probable, or possible). The new SEC rules for disclosing reserves no longer require that a limitednumber of rigidly specified technologies be used to establish the confidencelevel of reserves that a filer discloses. Reasonable certainty was required inthe past because only proved reserves could be disclosed, and, as an example,reasonable certainty of economic production required either flow tests oractual production to the surface except in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Thenew rules allow any technology that has been proved empirically to lead tocorrect conclusions, including proprietary technology, to be used to determinethe proper classification for a given petroleum accumulation. Unfortunately,the industry has been provided with only limited guidance on which technologieswill be satisfactory and which technologies will not.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Horizontal well technology is now considered a standard completion practice in unconventional gas reservoirs. With significant improvements in the drilling and completion technology, many tight gas and shale gas prospects have become economically viable. Optimizing location, distribution and the number of stages of hydraulic fractures is an important issue in tight gas reservoir completions, particularly for horizontal and complex wells.  The paper presents a fast approach to optimizing well completions in tight gas reservoirs using a rigorous semi-analytic computation of well drainage volumes in the presence of multiple stages of hydraulic fractures. Our approach relies on a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation and emulates the propagation of a ‘pressure front' in the reservoir along gas streamlines. The proposed approach is a generalization of the radius of drainage concept in well test analysis (Lee, 1982). The streamlines are computed from the pressure and velocity distribution derived from finite difference simulation. This makes the approach completely general and capable of handling complex spatial reservoir heterogeneity and arbitrary well conditions. Furthermore, the streamline approach is visual, intuitive and allows us to examine the interactions between the hydraulic fractures, reservoir heterogeneity and the implications on the drainage volumes and EUR calculations.  A field example is presented to demonstrate the application of our approach by optimizing well completions in a horizontal well recently drilled in the Cotton Valley formation. We first apply the proposed drainage volume calculations to an existing vertical well and identify its ‘region of influence' along with the potential interference from the proposed horizontal well. We then apply the drainage volume concept to the proposed horizontal well and examine the effects of different number of hydraulic fracture stages. The combined drainage volumes from the vertical and horizontal well are calculated as a function of the number of fracture stages to determine the point of diminishing return and to optimize the number of fracture stages. The results are found to be consistent with independent analysis based on rate profiles from numerical simulation and NPV calculations.  Introduction Hydraulic fracture treatment and horizontal well drilling technologies have become an integral part of the exploitation and development of tight gas reservoirs. These enabling technologies have spurred the development of unconventional resource base mainly consisting of tight gas sands, coal bed methane and shale gas. Hydraulic fracturing technology has evolved tremendously in the last decade in North America as a result of synergies derived from various functional and cross-functional groups. Microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing treatments and other fracture diagnostic methods have enabled greater understanding of the nature of the formation being stimulated. As a result, a greater portion of the ‘Resource triangle' for natural gas is now being accessed and the ‘Resource' base is being converted by consistent application of these technologies to ‘Reserves' (Holditch and Madani, 2010).

                    "abstract": "Analysts have increasingly used probabilistic approaches to evaluate the uncertainty in reserves estimates based on decline-curve analysis (DCA). This is because the results represent statistical analysis of historical data that usually possess significant amounts of noise. Probabilistic approaches usually provide a distribution of reserves estimates with three confidence levels (P10, P50, and P90) and a corresponding 80% confidence interval (CI). The question arises: How reliable is this 80% CI? In other words, in a large set of analyses, is the true value of reserves contained within this interval 80% of the time? Our investigation indicates that it is common in practice for true values of reserves to lie outside 80% CIs much more than 20% of the time using traditional statistical analyses. This indicates that uncertainty is being underestimated, often significantly. Thus, the challenge in probabilistic reserves estimation using DCA is not only how to appropriately characterize probabilistic properties of complex production-data sets, but also how to determine and then improve the reliability of the uncertainty quantifications. This paper presents an improved methodology for probabilistic quantification of reserves estimates using DCA and practical application of the methodology to actual individual-well decline curves. Application of our proposed new method to 100 oil and gas wells demonstrates that it provides much wider 80% CIs than methods previously presented, and these CIs contain the true values approximately 80% of the time. In addition, the method yields more-accurate P50 values than previously published methods do. Thus, the new methodology provides more-reliable probabilistic reserves estimation, which has important impacts on economic risk analysis and reservoir management. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Oil and gas reserves estimates which honor disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are critically important in the international oil and gas industry. Unfortunately, a number of E&P companies have allegedly overstated and subsequently written down certain reserves volumes in recent years. In some cases, the consequences have been quite adverse. We document some of these cases of reserves overstatements and summarize the consequences. Reserves write-downs are of obvious interest to numerous groups involved in the reserves estimation process and outcome, including estimators, managers, investors, creditors, and regulators. The magnitude and nature of recent overstatement cases, relative unfamiliarity with the SEC's inner-workings, and the Commission's new reserves reporting requirements, increase the need to examine critically reserves disclosures and reserves overstatements.  Disclaimer This paper discusses write-downs and alleged overstatements of oil and gas reserves. Information used to write this report has been obtained from extensive examination of the public record. Overstatements and violations of federal securities laws and actions by a company or its representatives are only alleged in the public record and, unless stated otherwise, any settlements discussed should be considered as made without admission of guilt. Write-downs can readily happen with even the best of intentions. We authors—and you readers—are not judge and jury. Our intent is to raise awareness about write-downs, overstatements, and observed consequences, and to promote the responsible reporting of oil and gas reserves.  Overview of the Reserves Overbooking Issue A number of E&P companies have, in recent years, allegedly overstated and subsequently written down certain reserves volumes reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Operators including Shell, El Paso, Stone Energy, and Repsol YPF, among others, have found themselves in the spotlight—and courtroom—for alleged overstatements of their oil and gas reserves. Overstatements and write-downs have occurred for a variety of reasons, and have often been accompanied by significant adverse consequences. A stigma and discomfort surrounding overstatements exists within industry, as the topic has been labeled \"the problem no one wants to talk about?? (McLane 2001).  The SEC has roles, investigative processes, and enforcement procedures unlike any other organization involved with the oil and gas industry. However, the Commission's inner workings are not frequently discussed or well-understood by all of the groups these rules affect. The SEC's Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements has made certain standards more flexible (e.g., elimination of the \"one offset rule?? and allowance of \"reliable technologies??). Accordingly, engineers must now adjust to these new guidelines and deal with the possibility of disclosing previously unrecognized asset value without overstating reserves. The difficulty of this task, along with the technical \"liberalization?? and an enhanced \"principles-based?? emphasis in the rules, could create even greater potential for reserves overstatements than in the past.  Therefore, the magnitude and nature of recent alleged overstatement cases, relative unfamiliarity with the SEC's innerworkings, and the Commission's new reporting requirements have created a need to discuss openly reserves disclosures and reserves overstatements. Overstatements are not confined to particular reserves categories, asset types or locations, or filer size. However, overstatements are most likely to occur within the Proved Undeveloped (PUD) category. Reserves write-downs can create nearly instantaneous value destruction for shareholders. A study of case histories indicates that significant corporate and/or individual penalties may be associated with overstatements, along with the potential for class action lawsuits. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes and validates a robust methodology to estimate fracture properties (half-length and conductivity), formation permeability, and, where possible, drainage area of individual layers in hydraulically fractured vertical gas wells producing commingled from multiple layers. Estimation of these fracture and individual layer properties is required to evaluate fracture treatment effectiveness and forecast future production for these wells.  To achieve our objectives, we applied an analytical elliptical flow solution to analyze production data from hydraulically fractured vertical tight gas wells producing from multilayer reservoirs. We were able to estimate the fracture half-length, formation permeability, and minimum drainage area of each layer. This study considered variations in completion details, initial reservoir pressures, reservoir temperatures, and other reservoir parameters in layers producing simultaneously.  The technology we developed includes the following components used in our analysis: flow rate allocation using available production logging test data, deconvolution to convert variable-rate pressure data into constant-rate pressure responses, identification of the elliptical flow regime, and analysis of elliptical flow data. We developed and present a new technique to identify the elliptical flow regime. We validated our method with synthetic data generated with a reservoir simulator.  Introduction Tight gas reservoirs have low permeabilities and porosities, and are considered unconventional sources of natural gas because they require hydraulic fracture treatments to produce commercial volumes and rates of gas. Most tight gas wells are drilled in multilayer reservoirs and completed with multiple fracture treatments. Reservoir and fracture parameters such as formation permeability, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity and minimum drainage area of each layer are required to evaluate the fracture treatment efficiency, optimize future hydraulic fracturing stimulation design, and forecast well flow behavior and performance. Typically, production data analysis techniques are used to estimate these properties for a hydraulically fractured well, but without production information for individual layers, these estimates have to be lumped into single-layer properties.  For commingled production from multiple layers, different flow regimes coexist in different layers because of variations in formation permeability and fracture half-length, which complicates the flow behavior of the well-reservoir system. As a result, it is very difficult to reliably estimate properties of individual layers using either conventional analytic or history matching techniques with limited PLT data. Unfortunately, it is the general case that only a few PLTs are available. "

They represent the opinions of neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor its staff members.  Abstract The term \"reliable technology?? as related to oil and gas reserves estimation is a recent development in reserves classification. This term was introduced in the updated regulations published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in late 2008. This paper will describe how reserves evaluators can use scientific practices to identify such reliable technologies and document that these technologies meet defined requirements. The paper will also explore the how Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) addresses the concept of reliable technologies and defines different levels of reliability to classify reserves estimates.  Reserves evaluators currently have limited guidance from the SEC or PRMS on how reliable technologies should be demonstrated. Since the use of new technologies is fundamental to advancing technical methods and practices in the Geosciences and Petroleum Engineering, the proposed approaches noted in this paper will provide useful support to enable the application of new technologies in reserves estimation and classification.  The paper draws on scientific practices and legal evidence rules (previously described by Miller 1997) to support the use of the scientific method for satisfying the requirements of reliability. The key steps of the scientific method are reviewed and adapted to the needs of demonstrating a reliable technology. The paper explains that the technology need be supported by both scientific theory and empirical data from experimental results. Also limitations on the technology including key assumptions and required conditions for successful application are discussed as part of the work needed to properly use the technology. Finally the paper will describe the level of empirical data needed for proper qualification of the reliable technology.  The recent publication of the SEC reserves reporting rules, which draw partially from the PRMS, has increased interest in deeper understanding of both these SEC rules and the PRMS. This paper will assist those who develop and use petroleum reserves data in understanding how technologies can be qualified to contribute to reliable reserves estimates and proper classification.  Introduction The concept of reliability as related to reserves is hardly new. For example, management will often rely on reserves estimates when project decisions are made. Intuitively, reliability is implied when a reserves estimate is deemed reasonably certain and of high confidence. Yet no formal method for demonstrating reliability has been described in reserves requirements or guidance. With the recent update to the SEC Oil and Gas Reporting regulations (\"Final Rule??), the term \"reliable technology?? was introduced. Further details on how the necessary reliability of a technology used in reserves estimation have not been provided by the SEC as of the writing of this paper. So the oil and gas industry, after years of lamenting inability to use modern technology for proved reserves, now has regulations which include flexibility to qualify new technologies but without clear guidance on what does and does not qualify. Some may see this as an example of the \"be careful of what you wish for?? curse. "

They represent the opinions of neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor its staff members.  Abstract Since a prior paper on analogy for estimating petroleum reserves (Hodgin and Harrell 2006), new dimensions of this topic have emerged. This paper provides updated guidance for analogy use and explains new concepts for the application of analogy in reserves estimation and classification.  Reserves evaluators using engineering and geoscience techniques now have new petroleum reserves rules that include the use of analogy. In 2007, the SPE finalized the Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) instructions and, in late 2008, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published updated regulations on reserves reporting. Recent papers (Lee 2009 and Etherington 2009) provide good summaries of the updated SEC rules and a comparison to PRMS. This paper will provide guidance to aid understanding of and compliance with these rules as related to the use of analogs.  The paper provides interpretations of new analogy-related terminology and the related reserves rules. It also gives examples of how these interpretations can be applied to common reserves estimation situations where analogy is used. The paper also addresses new concepts of how analogies can be shown as valid and adjusted for minor differences in the comparison of target field to analogy field.  The recent publication of the US SEC reserves reporting rules, which draw partially from the SPE PRMS, has increased interest in deeper understanding of both these SEC rules and PRMS. This paper will assist those who develop and use petroleum reserves data in understanding how the use of analogy can contribute to reliable reserves estimates and proper classification.  Introduction The use of analogy in estimating oil and gas reserves remains an important method for such technical determinations. The prior work by Hodgin and Harrell gives a good background on the use of analogy and practical application considerations for that use with the definitions and regulations of the day. This paper builds on these foundational elements to provide an update on the use of analogy after the recent publication of the SPE (2007) PRMS (including oil and gas reserves definitions) and the SEC (2008) \"Final Rule?? which applies to oil and gas reserves reporting.  Arguably the most critical part of analogy use is the identification (and validation) of an analogous reservoir. Hodgin and Harrell provide a good list of individual parameters to examine in making a comparison of the subject (or target) reservoir (for which the reserves estimation is being made) with the potentially analogous reservoir. This paper adds to the individual comparison of such parameters the concept of considering groups of key parameters \"in the aggregate?? as an approach to demonstrating a proper analogy. This concept is not new but has recently received attention from inclusion in the SEC Final Rule. "

                    "abstract": "This work combines two ideas—the stretched exponential decline curve model and the novel paradigm of data-intensive discovery—to provide a controlled production forecast for any individual tight gas/shale gas well on the basis of data gathered through parameter processing for a large group of wells.. Group production for a large number of wells follows stretched exponential decline behavior of production rates, which we model using the corresponding decline curve model. Compared to the Arps model, the new approach offers numerous advantages; the two most significant ones are the bounded nature of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) without limits on time or rate, and the straight-line behavior of a recovery potential expression that we introduce. This approach moves production forecasts in tight and unconventional gas fields from individual and subjective curve matching to a new methodology we call \"group-data controlled forecast.?? In terms of the novel stretched exponential decline curve model, the combined process offers statistically more consistent reserve estimates and also provides a potential well monitoring tool. Introduction In 1923 Arnold, one of the first scientists to apply decline curve analysis wrote: \"Twenty years ago the estimate of oil reserves was computed generally by calculating the contents of the supposed reservoir rock from data regarding thickness, extent, etc., guessing at the saturation and percentage of recoverable oil, and finally arriving at a very rough approximation of the desired information. Now, thanks to the great mass of data available and to the perfection of methods of computation, we get more accurate results. If we know the production of a given well over a reasonable period (even a period of days in some instances), we can calculate with remarkable accuracy the future production of the well by years and in totality, and thus arrive at the recoverable reserve for this well and its surrounding area.?? Arps' (1945) seminal work shows that early research focused on three major issues: conditions necessary for past production to be a predictor for future performance, appropriate mathematical models to describe observed trends, and available methods to identify model parameters. In the following decades, additional questions appeared: how to incorporate reservoir engineering concepts, such as pseudosteady state, material balance, etc., to constrain the model parameters to a \"physically reasonable?? range (Fetkovich, 1980) and whether total lease or field analysis would give results different from individual well analysis (Shea et al., 1964). In the 80s it was inevitable to apply hyperbolic decline to tight gas wells, and it soon turned out that the data are less amenable to straightforward application of the hyperbolic model (see, for example, Maley, 1985).Unconventional gas applications even amplified the problem, as reported frequently in the literature (Spivey et al., 2001; Rushing et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008;  Ilk, 2008.) To some extent the various resolution attempts have come full circle: restriction of the parameter space, adjustment of the fitting criteria, modification of the parameter search procedure, combination with mechanistic (physics-based) reservoir modeling, all of which already had some roots in the pre-1945 literature (Lewis and Beal, 1918; Cutler, 1924; Larkey, 1925; Johnson and Bollens,1927.)

                    "abstract": "Gas influxes are common during drilling operations. If not handled properly, in open loop systems gas can expand and unload the riser, however in closed loop systems, unless gas is depressurized, the top section of the riser will become over pressured. Riser unloading has not been accurately modeled due to uncertainties in gas expansion. This paper presents studies on gas expansion and unloading in a lab scale model at Texas A&M University. We have performed experiments in a scaled riser at the Dual Gradient Drilling laboratory. We ran experiments using water and air as the gas phase. We recorded the change in volume as gas expands and liquid height changes. We mitigated the disproportion of the atmospheric pressure and the scale of the model by using vacuum pumps. We also measured overflow by allowing liquid level to rise to determine the final gas volume. The experiments provide information on gas expansion and riser unloading. During the expansion process the top of the bubble travels rapidly building momentum, which carries a large volume of mud to the top of the riser model. This occurs through the rapid change in gas volume and the energy released as the pressure decreases. By allowing gas to expand in a controlled environment we measured the impact of gas expansion. This paper provides information on controlled and uncontrolled gas expansion, impact on riser unloading, and benefits of a closed system. "

                    "abstract": "An effective fracture toughness, based on equivalent energy release-rate hypothesis is presented for homogenizing heterogeneous layered media. Using crack closure method, the energy released when a mode-1 fracture propagates through an equivalent homogenized layer is equated to the sum of the energies released in the heterogeneous layered media. And from extensive numerical experiments, the predictions of fracture tips' positions through this proposed method are of the same range of accuracy as the known linear blend rule; the weakest link arguments technique performed poorly when compared to the other two methods. Therefore, homogenizing heterogeneous layered media with energy consistent approach will reduce the complexities associated with modeling fracture propagation in multi-layer without losing accuracy. Furthermore, an effective fracture toughness, based on equivalent energy release rate, equivalent strain energy, and modified Kachanov's damage theory is presented in this study. The proposed approach will reduce the computation time required in predicting fracture containment potential in formations with opened or sealed natural fractures. And comparing the proposed phenomenological model with the rigorous solution provided by Mori-Tanaka, it was observed that the margin of error was negligible. The benefit of the proposed phenomenological model over the Mori-Tanaka's effective shear modulus model is the ease of estimating the effective fracture toughness. Thus, these models can be applied to quickly estimate the potential for hydraulic fracture containment or broaching possibilities during oil and gas blowouts and fracturing operations. "

This paper presents the experimental research that is ongoing at the Dual Gradient Drilling Laboratory to understand the physics involved in gas migration. A scaled prototype of an offshore well was built to mimic the Controlled Mud Level (CML) Drilling method. Instrumentation and cameras were used to monitor flow rate and gas liquid ratio. Set rates for the mud outflow and inflow were determined and tested at constant gas influx, by increasing the mud inflow in narrow increments. The prototype was successfully tested and removed a large amount of gas from the system before the gas migrated into the voided section. The results of these tests show that using high mud inflow rates can eliminate the single bubble system, leading to a dispersed bubble system. With dispersed gas bubbles the removal of the gas is a process of determining an optimal outflow rate that would also accommodate the fluid level requirement. Also, it was observed that the geometry of the outflow line have a major effect on the gas flow behavior. With the reduced outlet diameter, a Bernoulli flow was observed which increased bubble dispersion. This paper provides information regarding the research on gas behavior and migration in a scaled riser system during circulation. These experiments can be used to study the effects of flow rates on gas dispersion and elimination from the CML Drilling method. "

                    "title": "Investigation of Transient Behavior During Dual-Gradient Drilling",
                    "abstract": "As the industry seeks out exploration prospects in deeper water, the complexity of drilling in tight pore-pressure and fracture-pressure windows has become increasingly challenging. Dual-gradient drilling (DGD) offers a promising solution through more closely matching the natural pressure gradient of the water depth. Coupled with imprecise nature of pore pressure prediction and formation strength, deepwater operations are subject to well control issues and losses due to fracture propagation. It is not uncommon to experience both influx and lost returns whilst drilling due to the nature of geological uncertainty. This paper examines simulation results specific to a ‘Controlled Mud Level’ (CML) system. This subclass of DGD enables operators to adapt bottomhole pressure (BHP) through adjusting annular mud height. The system relies on a subsea pump module (SPM) attached to the riser at a given height. Drilling fluid is diverted to the SPM and pumped via a return line instead of the riser. The inlet pressure required to maintain the desired annular mud height governs circulation rate. During transient events, such as a connection, the annular height is raised thereby accounting for loss of annular frictional pressure (AFP) once circulation stops. Conversely, when the connection resumes, riser level decreases to compensate for the AFP gain encountered. Mud height is raised to increase BHP during subsequent kill operations. This paper presents simulated transient behavior using commercial drilling software while concurrently highlighting the importance of understanding dynamic hydraulics in a low-price environment where deepwater wells show progressively diminishing operational margins.

                    "title": "Theoretical Development on Morphology of Wellbore Toroidal Breakout",
                    "abstract": "Abstract: Few researchers have conducted experimental investigations on the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout; also this breakout mode has been observed in the field. Unfortunately, there is no published theoretical study that adequately describes the occurrence of this unique feature. Thus, we have developed a theory that answers some of the questions related to the occurrence of wellbore toroidal breakout: (a). is the failure mode toroidal? (b). is the deepest depth for a homogeneous and isotropic formation at the center? (c). location of the deepest depth for a heterogeneous formation? To consider the impacts of support pressure on the breakout pattern, the two failure modes were considered, namely: shear fracture and extensile-splitting induced breakouts. Minimum strain energy criterion was used in determining the direction of the propagating extensile cracks; and the trajectories of the cracks were tracked with Fourier series of piece-wise linear functions. In the numerical experiments conducted, it was observed that the extensile cracks propagated in the r-z plane through mode II (shear) predominantly, and by mode I in the r - θ plane. By rotating the cracks profile in the r-z plane through the vertical axis by the breakout width, the breakout volume can be approximately determined; the volume generated by this rotation is usually greater than the actual volume. Introduction Extensive studies have been conducted on type- A breakout (Figs.1a and 1b); the breakout mode is primarily controlled by the tangential stress around the wellbore. Bell and Gough (1982) predicted that breakouts are spalled regions around the wellbore and the deepest depth align with the direction of the minimum horizontal in-situ stress; they envisioned a dog-eared breakout shape. Ewy and Cook (1990), Martin et al. (1994), Ewy et al. (1988) conducted laboratory experiments to confirm Bell and Gough's hypothesis. The triangular breakout section is often observed in some brittle geomaterials, like granite. But generally, the breakout shapes are flat-bottomed and broad (Zoback et al. 1985); these authors assumed that the breakout shape follows the potential shear failure lines and confirmed their theory with some field observations. Similarly, Kulandar and Dean (1985) and Pollard and Aydin (1988) also supported the curvy nature of the failure surface around the borehole through some observed experiments. Other notable laboratory experiments and field observations that support the curved failure surfaces include the works of Cuss et al. 2003, Stacey and Jongh (1978), and Ortlepp (1978); there are other references that support this hypothesis, which we have not mentioned.

We have designed a workable configuration suitable for coiled-tubing and conventional drillpipe operations. In addition, we have developed a procedure for selecting the required uphole motor size, rotating tubular dimensions, and circulation rate based on surface pump and tubular-buckling constraints. The configuration of the drillstring is highly sensitive to the flow and drilling parameters. And the rotating length function was derived using soft-string torque and drag model. The motor winding ratio and flow rate were made the independent variables of the rotating length and surface pump pressure functions. Based on available surface pump pressure, flow coefficient, and turbulence flow index constraints, the optimum uphole motor configuration and flow rate were determined. From the numerical tests conducted, it is evident that the tecnhlogy is viable and cheap. The technique can significantly increase the reach of tubular in the lateral sections of the wellbore. Furthermore, combining the uphole motor with the articulated tractor system, greater reach is achievable. "

This work evaluates the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for integrated control of well conditions and the topside separation system during UBD. The downhole well pressure, separator liquid levels, and the separator pressure are controlled by manipulation of the rig pump, the choke, and the separator valves. The control system adheres to downhole and topside constraints. These constraints include pore and collapse pressures, minimum flow rate for hole cleaning, maximum choke pressure, separator pressure, and separator liquid levels. The proposed MPC solution uses simple Hammerstein-Wiener models, where parameters are determined by system identification incorporated into standard drilling procedures. The control system is tested using a high-fidelity multi-phase flow simulator (OLGA) for some common drilling scenarios, including drilling into a producing formation and performing connections. We show that the MPC solution is able to take proactive action to ensure safe and efficient operation without having to enter well control mode or shutting down the separator system. By limiting the amount and variation in influx from the reservoir, we get less Non-Productive Time (NPT), we improve safety, and we may to some extent be able to reduce the footprint of the equipment.

                    "abstract": "Abundant unconventional resources, producing from deeper horizons and numerous frac jobs in the US were the prime motivations for creating a novel testing procedure for evaluating cement integrity under high pressure, high temperature conditions. Chances of cement sheath failure increase considerably when the application involves deep HPHT wells. Such failures occur as a result of temperature and pressure induced stresses created by well events. A specialized cement HPHT cell was manufactured and mounted on the Chandler 7600, the extreme HPHT Rheometer. This cell has the capability of curing and testing the cement sample in an annular shape at pressures up to 25,000 psi and temperatures up to 450 °F. Consequently after curing, cement samples were tested under cyclical loading in various scenarios at HPHT conditions. These samples failed after certain number of cycles due to reaching their fatigue endurance limit or inconsistent chemistry to withstand the HPHT conditions. This research identifies a matrix for the fatigue failure cycles of 1000 psi, 2000 psi and 5000 psi pressure differentials between the confining pressure and the maximum casing pressure. Three sets of sample were cured at 15000 psi and 330 °F for 15 hours. Then confining pressure was kept constant at 15,000 psi and in three tiers the casings pressure varied from 15000 to 16000, 15000 to 17000 and 15000 to 20000 psi in a cyclical manner for various samples. Results show when the fatigue endurance limit (failure cycle) happens due to pressure change under HPHT conditions. Class H plus 35% silica was used in these experiments and cement failures such as radial cracking, debonding, disking and slicing were observed. "

Due to the HPHT cycles experienced in the process of hydraulic fracturing, production and steam injection, the failure probability of low cycle cement fatigue is high in these wells and is likely to cause the failure of the zonal isolation and increase the casing failure probability. The experiment was set up to simulate conditions under which cement low cycle fatigue failure can occur. In the test, the casing was applied with zero based cyclic pressure to study the cement failure characteristics. The cement mechanical properties were measured at 14 days curing time under three different conditions: (1) room condition; (2) 167 °F, 14.7 psi; (3) 212 °F, 2610 psi; and used as the input data for finite element method analysis. The cement elastic strain and plastic strain developed in the experimental test was calculated by finite element method and thereby the cement cycles to failure can be predicted based on the strain–cycle relationship. As the confining pressure increase, the cement shows more plasticity and can hold more pressure cycles. At the temperature below 300 °F, the stress developed by thermal expansion has minor effect on the cement low cycle fatigue. The cement with higher Poisson's ratio and lower Young's modulus shows better low cycle fatigue behavior. The results of strain–cycle relationship were applied in HPHT gas wells in south Texas to predict the cement fatigue failure under different operations. This paper proposes the low cycle fatigue failure envelope that can help reduce the cement failure and improve the cement design in HPHT wells and steam injection wells. "

                    "abstract": "Increasing the reach of coiled tubing in the lateral sections of directional wells has been a longtime quest. Although many techniques have been developed to increase the reach of the tubing string in the wellbore, they are not capable of making coiled-tubing technology viable for extended-reach and ultra-extended-reach well services or drilling. Similarly, the coiled-tubing industry has been aspiring to have a technique to rotate the tubing string, but all the attempts made in the past to rotate the string have proven impractical; the rotation of the coiled-tubing string will enhance the reach of the tubing (and improve hole cleaning process during coiled-tubing drilling). This study aims to demonstrate that the reach of coiled tubing in the lateral sections of directional wells can be increased significantly with the use of downhole motors. Also, this paper shows that the deployment of a “second” downhole motor (with high torque specification) will rotate the coiled-tubing string effectively. In the proposed extended-reach technique, the configuration of the coiled-tubing unit remains unaltered. But the tubing string is divided into two parts: rotating and nonrotating tubing segments. The determination of the rotating tubing length is primarily dependent on the torsional yield strength of the tubing and well geometry. From the series of computer simulation tests conducted, the lateral displacement of the coiled-tubing string increases significantly when a downhole motor is used in rotating the string. Also, the investigations show that the deployment of a hydraulic downhole motor predisposes the nonrotating tubing segment to twisting if a twisting-restraining tool is not installed on the string. The implementation of this technique is expected to be very simple and cheap, since it does not require intense modification of the current coiled-tubing unit configuration. "

You probably are wondering how this relates to well control. In our work schedules, we all are faced with situations in which we are required to complete multiple concur-rent tasks. This often is the case when we rush to finish drilling a problem well so that we can get the drilling rig moved to the next location and turn this well over to the completions team. Multiple activities must be completed concurrently that, individually, are relatively simple, but each activity requires the attention of the driller, tool pusher, company man, and others on the crew. When one of these tasks begins to go awry, our attention may be on something else, and we can miss important warnings until it is too late to avoid a disaster. What is the point? Once again, I will use the Macondo blowout as an example. To leave the well in a position to be completed by another crew, mud had to be removed from the riser and top of the well and be replaced with seawater. A spacer was pumped between the mud and seawater to prevent mixing of the seawater and mud. This is a simple enough operation, it seems, but when seawater is being pumped into the well, mud has to be pumped onto a workboat to prevent the pits from running over, and the spacer is being dumped overboard; keeping track of how much of each fluid is going where becomes a daunting task. Could this have been a contributing factor in not recognizing the beginning of the kick? Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org.

                    "abstract": "The failure probability of wellbore is high in HPHT gas wells because of the effect of the hole angle, the cementing complications and the high pressure high temperature environment. However, most of the researches about the cement problems are studied by two dimensional modeling. The effect of hole angle and cement complications on HPHT well integrity in three dimension is hardly studied. In the analysis, the finite element method was used to build a three dimension simulation model where the hole angle, casing eccentricity, and cement channels are considered. One cement system (118-lbm/ft3) commonly applied in oil field is used to study the effect of cement complications on the wellbore integrity. The hole angle, cement channel angle, and casing eccentricity are the variables taken into account and an attempt is made to which parameter is the most important and its effects on wellbore failure. In the cement channeling, the casing has highest von Mises stress at the hole angle of 90°, and the cement tends to fail in tension. The casing eccentricity tends to reduce cement shear stress, and tensile stress but increase cement compressive stress. The cement has the highest compressive failure probability in casing eccentricity condition. At the casing eccentricity lower than 40%, for different hole angle, the casing eccentricity has minor effect on the casing. This paper presents the sensitivities of the variables and gives a better understanding of the effect of hole angle and cement complications on the HPHT well integrity. Introduction Due to the high costs associated with HPHT wells, finding ways to reduce the failure probability and increase the wellbore life are high-priority items. In the completion process, cementing complications may occur although the best efforts are being used.  Determining the effect of cementing complications and identifying methods to mitigate or avoid wellbore failure is highly important. Casing eccentricity is usually a function of the wellbore angle, the number of casing centralizers, and the wellbore dimensions. The higher the wellbore inclination angle is usually leads to a higher value of casing eccentricity (Ferda et al. 2004). The effect of casing eccentricity on a cementing operation was investigated by Courturier et al. (1990) and Silva et al. (1996). When the casing is not centered in the wellbore, the fluid favors the path of least resistance and flows more rapidly on the wide side rather than on the narrow side. These conditions result in a distorted velocity distribution and the displaced fluids may bypass the slow moving drilling mud on the narrow side. At the conclusion of the displacement process, the annulus may contain a long strip of inefficient cement displacement of the drilling mud in a given interval, depending on the local geometry. If casing eccentricity occurs, cement channeling tends to build up simultaneously, which allows cavities to be filled with drilling mud, unset cement, or formation fluids. To prevent cement channeling, mud, spacers, and the cement properties must be designed properly as defined by Christopher et al. (1990). A number of techniques can be used to detect and repair cement channels (Hart et al. 1990). "

Texas A&M University recently has established a new method to develop a drilling expert system that can be used as a training tool for young engineers or as a consultation system in various drilling engineering concepts such as drilling and completion fluids, cementing, completion, and underbalanced drilling practices. Drilling fluids are important factor in drilling and completion operations. Designing drilling fluids depend on formation lithology, temperature and pressure. To the best of the authors knowledge there is no standards developed to aid drilling engineers and scientists to formulate effective drilling fluids systems for the entire well sections. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first study to show a systematic method to design drilling fluids for oil and gas wells.  The objective of this paper is to set a module that should aid drilling engineers when designing drilling fluids. A module was created based on several inputs. To create this module, we interviewed experts to gather the information required to determine best practices as a function of different probabilities. We used these best practices to build decision trees that allow the user to take an elementary data set and end up with a decision that honors the best practices.  Introduction McCaskill & Bradford mentioned the factors that we need to consider when designing drill-in fluids. For example, formation permeability determines filtration characteristics. Temperature or water sensitive formation determines the type of polymer and type of drill-in fluids needed. The authors also suggested that there are goals in designing drill-in fluids that we need to consider such as rheological properties to provide good carrying capacity and minimum filtration control loss. Samuel, et al. explained polymers function in providing filtration and viscosity to drill-in fluids are affected at high temperature because of the degradation of polymers or reduced molecular interactions.  The design of drilling fluid expert system depends mainly on previous experience and knowledge to successfully complete with a degree of confidence. Effective communication is also an important factor for successful drilling fluids operations. Good coordination is required between the engineer, the service company and the rig foreman.

                    "abstract": "Abstract In underbalanced drilling the use of air as an injected gas sets up the potential for oxygen corrosion. Membrane nitrogen with about 5% oxygen eliminates the chance for fire or explosion, but does not solve the corrosion problem. Natural gas or cryogenic nitrogen eliminates the chance for oxygen corrosion, but does not always eliminate the chance of corrosion from other down hole acid gasses (Hydrogen Sulfide, H2S, Carbon Dioxide, and CO2). Any corrosion that occurs while drilling will be forced by some drilling fluid or drilling operational procedure such as KCl fluids, aerated mud, or floating mud cap operations.  The objective of this study is to identify some of the practical elements of corrosion encountered with underbalanced drilling and their optimum solution by development of an advisory system based on field cases and expert opinions. This advisory system is intended to be a field guide for the drilling engineer or rig supervisor. Corrosion is a matter of concern to the drilling contractor because of pitting or loss of steel in the drill pipe.  The advisory system is developed by proposing a set of guidelines for the optimal practices to minimize corrosion in underbalanced drilling operations. The optimum practices collected from data and experts' opinions, are integrated into a Bayesian Network BN to simulate likely scenarios of its use that will honor efficient practices when dictated by varying certain parameters. These parameters are measuring corrosion, identifying corrosion types, drill pipe and corrosion, treatment methods for H2S corrosion, CO2 sources and treatment, different methods to test for corrosion, general corrosion prevention and treatment, treatment methods for formation water and makeup water, and recommended practices to minimize corrosion in underbalanced drilling operations.  To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first study to develop an advisory system for minimizing corrosion problems. The developed software solutions on corrosion will be demonstrated such as using mechanical means to reduce O2 concentration and inhibitors for pipe coating. Finally, the advisory system list recommendations for all types of underbalanced drilling (flow, aerated, foam and mist) to minimize corrosion problems.

                    "abstract": "Cement durability is very important to maintain proper well isolation and stability under HPHT conditions. In the process of well completion and production, pressure decline and temperature variation with time can contribute to cement failure and wellbore stability issues. However, there is no available investigation in the durability and comparison of different types of cement at higher temperature and at different operational scenarios. Three different types of cement (72 pcf, 101 pcf and 118 pcf) commonly used in the Middle East were cured and tested at 300ºF in the study. The tests included one year mechanical properties measurement such as compressive strength development, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Finite element method was used to analyze the failure probability of HPHT wells over with time.  At the variation of bottom hole pressure and temperature, the casing, cement, and formation system failure probability was studied for these types of cement. The results show that the pressure variation has more effect on the wellbore stability than the temperature variation for HPHT wells. Low density cement can improve the wellbore stability issues due to the cement elastic behavior. This paper introduces the operational envelope for every type of cement investigated in order to achieve successful operations based on field conditions. Field cases were discussed to validate the results of this investigation. Introduction The good cement sheath has the effect of: (1) providing support for the casing; (2) zonal isolation; (3) providing corrosive protection for the casing. It is important to have a good cement sheath to maintain wellbore integrity. The three types of cements (72 pcf, 101 pcf and 118 pcf) are successfully used in Haradh which is located in the southern part of the Ghawar oil field in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (shown in Figure 1). The 72 pcf light weight cement was used to control lost circulation and eliminate the stage collar for multistage cementing in the cementing operation. The light weight cement was successfully applied all over the world. Due to the lost circulation and formation low fracture gradient, lightweight cement is required to reduce the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column while placing the cement slurry. The concept of particle packing is introduced in petroleum industry to obtain light weight high performance cements (Eric et al., 1997; Bernard et al., 2002). Because of the poor performance of Multiple Stage Cementer, the stage collar could be the weak point in the casing string. The well service life can be increased by using high-performance light weight cement and eliminating the stage collar for multistage cementing (Talal et al., 1999). Later, the light weight cement was successfully applied in San Juan Basin in the area of New Mexico (Ross et al., 2001). At the same time, to overcome the lost circulation, ultra lightweight cement system with a density close to that of water was used to ensure good casing protection and zonal isolation in United Arab Emirates fields (Christian et al., 2001). Under high temperature high pressure cement curing conditions, the cement mechanical property development is sensitive to temperature rather than pressure. At high temperature, it is observed that there is a general coarsening of the nanometer-scale structure of the hardened cement paste over time, with associated degradation of the properties (Jeffrey et al., 2012).  In the study, the three cement systems were cured at the temperature of 300 0F for the period of 1, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 360 days. The cement mechanical properties were shown in table 1. "

                    "abstract": "Cementing a string in one stage is a challenging task, especially in the presence of weak formations.  Cement slurry losses during placement is highly possible if the equivalent circulating density (ECD) exceeds 82 pcf during placement. A conventional method to overcome this challenge is to use multi-stage cementing by setting the stage tool above the loss circulation zone. However, field data indicate that the tool can fail, thus causing serious delay and economic loss. In addition, stage tools are considered weak point and not good for long term seal. A second method for zonal isolation is to use low density cement. In this study, we present extensive lab evaluation of a low density system based on the use of hollow microspheres for one year at field conditions. The tests included one year mechanical properties measurement such as compressive strength development, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The low-density system (70 pcf) was tested at 300 ºF. An earlier study has shown the suitability of using low density cement in the field, Al-Yami et al. (2007). However, there is no available Investigation in the literature about the durability of low density cement at higher temperature and at different operational scenarios. The finite element method was used to analyze the failure probability of HPHT wells over with time.  At the variation of bottom whole pressure, the casing, cement, and formation system failure probability was studied for this type of cement. This paper introduces the operational envelope for this type of cement in order to achieve successful operations. Field cases were discussed to validate the results of this investigation.  Introduction The good cement sheath has the effect of: (1) providing support for the casing; (2) zonal isolation; (3) providing corrosive protection for the casing. It is important to have a good cement sheath to maintain wellbore integrity. The 72 pcf cements are successfully used in Haradh which is located in the southern part of the Ghawar oil field in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia (shown in Fig.1). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Texas A&M University recently has established a new method to develop a drilling expert system that can be used as a training tool for young engineers or as a consultation system in various drilling engineering concepts such as drilling and completion fluids, cementing, completion, and underbalanced drilling practices. To the best of the authors knowledge there is no standards developed to aid drilling engineers and scientists to formulate effective drilling fluids systems for the entire well sections.  The objective of this paper is to set a module that should aid drilling engineers when designing drilling fluids. A module was created based on several inputs. To create this module, we interviewed experts to gather the information required to determine best practices as a function of different probabilities. Drilling fluids formulations were gathered from Saudi Arabia fields to build up this model.  The Bayesian approach was found suitable for designing expert system. The model can work as a guide to aid drilling engineers and scientists to design and execute optimum drilling fluids. Using this approach to build up expert systems is more flexible than using flow charts. Updating flow charts is time consuming and require redesigning them again to be used by different experts or in different fields. Using Bayesian network allows us to update our industry practices by updating the probabilities states mentioned in this paper.  Introduction (McCaskill & Bradford, 2004) mentioned the factors that we need to consider when designing drill-in fluids. For example, formation permeability determines filtration characteristics. Temperature or water sensitive formation determines the type of polymer and type of drill-in fluids needed. The authors also suggested that there are goals in designing drill-in fluids that we need to consider such as rheological properties to provide good carrying capacity and minimum filtration control loss.  Samuel et al. (2003) explained polymers function in providing filtration and viscosity to drill-in fluids are affected at high temperature because of the degradation of polymers or reduced molecular interactions.  The design of drilling fluid expert system depends mainly on previous experience and knowledge to successfully complete with a degree of confidence. Effective communication is also an important factor for successful drilling fluids operations.  Good coordination is required between the engineer, the service company and the rig foreman. Knowledge transfer is therefore fundamental for the optimal design of the job, Shadravan et al. (2010).  Field and lab experience are required for drilling fluid specialists to select optimum practices. In some instances, operation failures can occur because of the lack of knowledge or lack of knowledge transfer.  There are different methods that companies have approached to make drilling fluids guidelines for their engineers to save on operations cost and time. However, these methods cannot be used by other companies or experts with different opinions or with different field conditions.  Al-Yami et al. (2010) were the first to propose a systematic approach to build expert systems that can be used in optimum selection and execution of successful cementing operations using Artificial Bayesian Intelligence.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The failure probability of casing collapse is high in HPHT gas wells because of the cementing complications and the operational environment. In the life of a well, the cement sheath not only provides zonal isolation but also supports casing and increases casing collapse resistance. Due to the high temperature high pressure conditions, the cement sheath plays a more important role in maintaining wellbore integrity. During the production process in HPHT gas wells, the pressure differential inside the casing and the surrounding formation is larger than the conventional wells, this presents a greater challenge to the casing integrity.  Casing eccentricity, cement voids and cement channels usually are cementing complications in HPHT gas wells. Pore- pressure was also considered in this study. In the analysis, the finite element method was used and 2D simulation model was built to study the effect of cementing complications on casing collapse resistance. In the study, two cement systems, brittle cement system and elastic cement system, were used to analyze the effect of the cement property on the casing collapse resistance. In the sensitivity analysis, void location, void size and shape, casing eccentricity, pore pressure, casing internal pressure, horizontal stress, cement Young's Modulus, cement Poisson ratio, hole diameter, and formation temperature were considered to study their effect on casing collapse resistance.  The results showed that an improvement of collapse resistance of 12% is observed in various conditions in elastic cement system. Casing collapse resistance is very sensitive to void location, cement Poisson's Ratio, cement Young's Modulus, and pore-pressure. Casing eccentricity and voids shape have minor effect on the casing collapse resistance. Simultaneous cement channeling and casing eccentricity is the worst case scenario in casing collapse resistance.  This study gives a better understanding of casing collapse failure in HPHT gas wells and helps improve cement and casing design to maintain wellbore integrity that can be expected to last for the life of the well.  Introduction Exploring and producing new hydrocarbon reserves may be a more and more challenging task, often requiring petroleum industry to contend with hostile downhole conditions. Although high-pressure, high-temperature wells are drilled, stimulated, produced and monitored in a way similar to wells with less-demanding conditions, the HPHT environment limits the range of available materials and technologies to exploit these reservoirs. The oil and gas industry has been contending with elevated temperatures and pressures for years.  Wells that present HPHT characteristics have been being drilled since the late 70's in the Gulf of Mexico and in the early 80's in the North Sea. HPHT wells have been split into three categories based on the temperature and pressure envelopes, namely HPHT, extreme HPHT and ultra-HPHT wells, with temperature higher than 400 0F and pressure greater than 20,000 psi (R.R. Paula Jr., et al., 2009). According to the Health and Safety Executive, British safety agency, the HPHT well (in the industry, these wells are known as high pressure and high temperature) is the one where the non-disturbed, bottom temperature, is superior to 3000F and the highest gradient of the pores pressure foreseen for any porous formation exceeds 0.8 psi/ft or the required working pressure for the equipment of well controlling (BOP) is superior to a 10,000 psi.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Casing has a higher likelihood of failure in compacting reservoir than in a typical reservoir. Casing fails because reservoir compaction induces compression and shear stresses onto it. The compaction occurs as reservoir pressure depletes during production. High compacted reservoirs typically are composed of unconsolidated, overpressured rocks such as chalk, diatomite, and sandstone. Pore pressure depletion increases effective stress, which is the rock matrix stress pushing upward against overburden pressure. Effective stress may exceed rock compressive strength, inducing compaction. Wells in compacting reservoirs are likely to fail and to have high deformation rates.  This paper introduces the concept of structural reliability to quantify the probability of casing failure in compacting reservoirs. Probabilistic models for casing capacities are developed using current design methods and a reservoir compaction load observed using finite-element model simulations. The proposed probabilistic models are used to define two limit-states functions used in predicting the probability of casing failure for two possible modes of failure: axial yielding and buckling failures. A limit-state function describes the casing condition as the casing experiences a reservoir compaction load. The limit state function is the input in component and system analyses for estimating the probabilities of failure as reservoir pressure is depleting. Sensitivity and importance analyses are also performed to determine the role and significant of parameters and random variables affecting the casing reliability.  Applying the knowledge produced from this research to casing design can improve design reliabilities and forecast the probability of casing failure in compacting reservoirs.  Introduction Casing failure and deformation are becoming problems in mature oilfields. The number of these oilfields has been increasing since 1980, where failures are a major problem to cause wells to stop producing or preventing necessary well services. The number of failure reported from Shengli oilfield, Ekofisk chalk field, and Belridge diatomite field combined to over 10,000 casing failures (Yodavich et al. 1998, Fredich et al. 1998).  A major cause of casing failure in these mature fields is reservoir compaction. Reservoir compaction causes casing to experience large additional stresses that casing may not be designed for. Assessing and predicting casing conditions in mature fields where reservoirs tend to compact are important in order to prevent casing failures. Many papers have shown casing failure mechanisms and reservoir compaction mechanisms using methods such as geomechanical simulation, analytical formulation, and probabilistic modeling.  Geomechanical simulations are widely used to determine high stress zones in the formation around the field. Earlier geomechanical models depend on 2D modeling to find crucial depths and compaction rates related to the amount of production (Chia et al. 1989, Fredich et al. 1998, Hansen et al.1995, Wooley et al. 1988). Today technology and software allows users to create 3D reservoir models or use an existing model from reservoir simulation to compute compaction rates and stresses in the formation (Bruno 2001, Hilbert et al. 1998). Modeling provides answers to casing failure mechanism as reservoirs compact and high compaction location. Although these models prove to be very useful, they cannot account for uncertainties from model parameters or methods used in simulation. Also, modeling results do not quantify the accuracy and correctness of its results. Geomechanical simulations also take time to build and run. "

Every decision after this point must consider controlling formation pressures to prevent any unintended influx into the wellbore, buildup of annulus pressure, and uncontrolled flow of wellbore and formation fluids during the drilling, completion, and production operations and even after the well is plugged and abandoned. Serious well-control incidents can occur any time after the well is spud in, even when least expected. Two recent incidents in the Gulf of Mexico remind us of this fact. The first that I will mention is the BP Macondo blowout. Because this incident has been covered thoroughly by the media, all I will say is, “Could part of the reason for loss of control be that the crew thought that just because casing had been set and cemented that nothing could happen and then when it did, it caught them off guard?” This example is a vivid reminder that once casing is installed and cement is pumped, the danger is not over. The other incident never made the news because there was nothing spectacular about it—no injuries, no explosion, and no release of oil into the Gulf. This incident was mentioned briefly at the 2010 Decommissioning Summit, Gulf of Mexico. I bring it up to point out that, even though the industry as a whole exceeds mandated plugging requirements, things still can go wrong. As was stressed at the summit, industry needs to think of plugging as a business, not just an expense at the end of the life of the well. After all, we intend for the plugs to last for eternity.

Many completions have been analyzed in this project, resulting in the best practices, as outlined in this paper.  The objective of this paper is to propose a set of guidelines for the optimal completion design, by integrating current best practices through a decision-making system based on Artificial Bayesian Intelligence. Best completion practices collected from data, models, and experts' opinions, are integrated into a Bayesian Network BN to simulate likely scenarios of its use, that will honor efficient designs when dictated by varying well objectives, well types, temperatures, pressures, rock and fluid properties.  The described decision-making model follows a causal and uncertainty-based approach capable of simulating realistic conditions on the use of completion operations. For instance, the use of water swelling packer dictates the use of organic acids instead of HCl acids. However, rock type and well geometry affect our selection of treatment fluids. Another example is selection of sand control method based on rock properties. The paper also outlines best operational practices in fracturing, sand control, perforation, treatment and completion fluids, multilateral junction level selection and lateral completion. The paper also discusses in details special well completions. Completion experts' opinions were considered in building the model in this paper.

                    "abstract": "Technology Focus It has been stated many times that all the easy wells have been drilled. It would stand to reason then that only problem wells remain. Even though this last statement is not entirely correct, our industry is facing increasingly costly incidences of pressure-related nonproductive time. Problems include narrow pore-/fracture-pressure windows, wellbore stability, depleted formations, formation damage, and excessive casing strings, among others. The industry has responded by developing managed-pressure-drilling (MPD) technologies. The goal of MPD is precise management of the pressure in the entire annulus. In most instances, a rotating control head is used, diverting the mud returns through an adjustable choke. This closed system allows precise imposition of surface backpressure on the annulus and enables precise measurement of the mud-return rate. The use a rotating control device and choke in this way is very similar to a constant-bottomhole-pressure method of well control. In September 2009, the SPE Drilling & Completions Applied Technology Workshop on Well Control was held in Rio de Janeiro, during which several companies involved in MPD made presentations on how their MPD technologies have enhanced well control. The closed system, which precisely measures surface pressures and mud-return rates, enables the detection of kicks (sometimes with less than 1 bbl of influx). Then, the mud-return rate is slowed to the prekick rate long enough to stop the influx and the well is killed, all without shutting in the well. In some cases, when a very small influx is detected, it is not even necessary to stop drilling. The papers selected to be highlighted in this issue all detail unconventional well-control methods that have been used recently. On the basis of these papers and presentations at the Applied Technology Workshop, it appears that well control with MPD will quickly become “conventional.” Well Control additional reading available at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org IPTC 11970 • “Killing a Gas Well: Successful Implementation of Innovative Approaches in a Middle-Eastern Carbonate Field—A Field Case” by S.

Even though the term \"MPD?? was first coined in 2003, several of its variations have been tested and used in the industry for a very long period of time, dating back to as early as the 19th century. Until now, several MPD wells have been drilled for purposes and objectives ranging from ‘fighting narrow pressure windows' to ‘pore-pressure prediction', more so in the last decade. However, the big question for any upcoming project always remains: \"to MPD or not to MPD??. Even with all the advances in science and technology and increased availability of equipment and expertise, the industry still lacks a Candidate Identification Mechanism (CIM)/Candidate Selection Model (CSM) that is exclusively developed for MPD and its applications, and considers the engineering and economic aspects of the given project. A new MPD CIM described in this paper provides a basic tool that takes into consideration the available engineering data and determines if MPD is a solution for the given project/field/well.  This MPD CIM is a result of constant interaction between the petroleum industry and the Petroleum Engineering research program at Texas A&M University (TAMU). The candidate selection model and software, which comprehensively explain the MPD CIM, are supported by an MPD wells database and the TAMU research thesis. Traditional, Advanced and Expanded MPD Applications Traditionally, MPD is invariably associated with drilling through narrow pressure windows (Nauduri et al, 2009). A traditional MPD variation, Constant Bottomhole Pressure (CBHP), used with surface backpressure and/or mass-flow meter helps to drill through such zones that have little operating range between pore-pressure or wellbore stability and fracture pressure. Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD), used to drill in offshore deepwater and ultra-deepwater with such narrow pressure windows to reach the target with reasonable pipe diameter and minimum casing points, Pressurized Mudcap Drilling (PMCD), used to drill through highly fractured/cavernous formations with total or near total mud losses, and Health Safety and Environment (HSE) or closed system MPD, used to provide isolation from formation fluids including H2S and CO2, are other traditional MPD variations or applications available in the drilling industry (Hannegan 2005, Hannegan 2006, Nauduri et al, 2009, Nauduri 2009). Advancement in equipment, technology, and approach to solve drilling problems led to the development of an advanced MPD variation, a modified version of CBHP, known as Point of Constant Pressure (PoCP) (Stone and Tian 2008). PoCP focuses on maintaining a fixed range of annular pressure at any given point in the open wellbore, including the bottom of the hole, further extending the advantages of CBHP MPD. Other advanced MPD applications include using CBHP to drill through multiple narrow zones or to reduce casing points and combining CBHP and HSE to drill through narrow pressure windows in hazardous zones.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of the performance of the casing - cement bond under HPHT well conditions, leading to a model to predict well life. An analytical model of wellbore stresses based on wellbore parameters was developed. The new model considers the casing as a thin wall cylinder, while cement and formation are modeled using a thick wall cylinder theory. Also the equivalent stress is calculated using different failure criteria that allow the user to simulate all possible load conditions on the casing-cement-formation system. The results were confirmed by finite element simulations. The new model that was implemented in an easy to use calculation sheet will give production engineers a simple tool to estimate the well integrity under various downhole conditions.  Introduction For an oil/gas well to maintain its integrity and be produced effectively and economically, it is pertinent that a complete zonal isolation is achieved during the life of the well. This complete zonal isolation, however, can be compromised due to factors that come into play during the operative life of the completed well. Such factors may come in the form of thermal or pressure loads generally regarded as HTHP (High Temperature-High Pressure) loads which can manifest themselves as static/cyclic loads or both depending on how it is exerted. Cement structures experiencing cyclic loading conditions can fail as a result of fatigue due to extensive degradation of the microstructure of the cement material depending on stress levels and number of cycles. A well maintains its integrity if it effectively achieves zonal isolation over its productive life. However, maintaining integrity is not always the case in real life oilfield practice as case histories abound where the integrity of the well was compromised due to failure of the cement sheath leading to loss of money and production.  In order to keep up with the world's energy demands, oil and gas producing companies have taken the initiative to explore offshore reserves or drill deeper into previously existing wells. The consequence of this, however, has to deal with the high temperatures and pressures encountered at increasing depths. The industry acknowledges the threshold for high temperature and high pressure conditions as 300F and 10,000 psi respectively. For temperatures and pressures above these values, only a rigorous design would ensure the integrity of the well. High temperature/high pressure (HTHP) scenarios can be seen in the case of Tuscaloosa trend in Louisiana drilled to a depth of 23,000 ft and with bottom hole temperature of 4000F and pressures between 17000 to 20000 psi or even in the Shearwater field in the East Central Graben area of the North sea with a depth of 16000 ft, temperature of 3600F and pressure of 15,200 psi to mention but a few.  These actual HTHP industrial experiences highlighted the inadequacy of conventional cementing procedures to provide adequate zonal isolation. High temperatures and pressures or even post-cementing stresses imposed on the cement sheath as a result of casing pressure testing, formation integrity tests etc. set in motion events which could compromise the long term integrity of the cement sheath due to fatigue. Knowledge of the mechanism of fatigue in cement and factors that affect it like the magnitude of the load, strength and composition of the cement, mechanical properties of the cement, pattern of load cycles etc. are important to achieve a realistic design of a cement system that will be subjected to fatigue loading. Such a design will go a long way to ensure the long term integrity of a well operating under HTHP conditions. "

For rigorous 3D coupled flow-geomechanical modeling, we employ a numerical method that can model failure by tensile and shear stresses, dynamic nonlinear permeability, dual continuum approach, and thermo-poro-mechanical effects. From numerical simulation, we find that the fracture propagation is not the same as propagation of the water front, because fracturing is governed by geomechanics whereas water saturation is determined by multiphase flow. At early times, the water front is almost identical to the fracture tip, suggesting that the fracture is mostly filled with the injected water. However, at late times, movement of the water front is retarded compared to fracture propagation, yielding a significant gap between the water front and the fracture top, filled with reservoir gas. During fracture propagation, the coupled flow-geomechanical models are transformed via a rock-physics model into electrical conductivity models. We employ a full 3D finite-element EM geophysical simulator to evaluate the sensitivity of the crosswell EM method to fracture propagation. It is shown that anomalous distribution of electrical conductivity is closely related to the injected water saturation, but not closely related to newly created unsaturated fractures. Our numerical modeling experiments demonstrate that the crosswell EM method can be highly sensitive to electrical conductivity changes that directly indicate the migration pathways of the injected fluid. Accordingly, the EM method can serve as an effective monitoring tool for monitoring the injected fluids during hydraulic fracturing operations. "

Focusing on immiscible two-phase flow, we mainly investigate mathematical analysis of stability, and find that the method based on the plasticity can provide well-posedness (thermodynamic stability) and algorithmic stability (B-stability). Then, the numerical scheme of this study can stably model several cyclic drainage-imbibition processes. The plastic parameters can track and compute history-dependent properties. In numerical simulation, we apply the algorithm of the 1D isotropic/kinematic hardening plasticity to simulation of gas-water flow. For weak and strong capillarity, the modeling yields strong numerical stability even for several drainage-imbibition processes. We also identify differences between with and without hysteresis, particularly in capillary pressure. Thus, the hysteresis modeling based on the theory of plasticity is promising for numerical simulation of strong hysteresis. "

High-order methods in time are often used, for example, in order to match high-order schemes in space. We consider two operator splitting methods motivated from the fixed-stress split: a two-pass algorithm and a spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. The two-pass algorithm, known for a symmetric operator splitting scheme as Strang's splitting, is typically employed for a high-order method of non-stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The SDC method is also a structure conserving efficient scheme for an arbitrary high-order of accuracy. However, poromechanics yields the governing equations that have a form of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), where typical high-order time integration schemes for non-stiff ODEs are not appropriate. Performing mathematical analysis, we find that both methods do not achieve high-order accuracy in poromechanics, although both methods can reduce the errors in their time discretizations. From numerical experiments, we find that the mathematic estimates are consistent with the numerical results of the fixed-stress type two-pass and SDC methods, which still provide the first-order accuracy in time.

                    "abstract": "We parallelize individual non-isothermal fluid-flow and geomechanics simulators separately, and then use a sequential method for coupling between flow and geomechanics. Message Passing Interface (MPI) is employed in the distributed memory system, and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) is used in the shared memory system. We primarily implement MPI for matrix assembly and parallel solvers, particularly using the PETSc library codes while using OpenMP for other miscellaneous subroutines to prevent significant overheads. We also study different matrix decomposition schemes for the geomechanics linear system, which not only precondition for parallel solvers but also assign computation loads to cores involved in the cluster. We take more than one million cells to investigate parallel performance. For both flow and geomechanics, the parallelization largely reduces the overall simulation execution time and obtains scalable speedups. Parallel-solver-only performance is tested as well. We find that solver performance achieves scalable speedups, where the optimum overall speedup for the parallel coupled simulator exceeds 14. Also, matrix decomposition methods have effects on parallelization in terms of execution time and solver performance, implying that the selection of matrix decomposition methods is important for high efficiency parallelization. The parallel scheme in this study can straightforwardly be applied to other sequentially coupled simulators, without significant code development. When the flow and geomechanics simulators are sequentially coupled, we find that the scalability of the parallel coupled simulator can be honored. We also find that plasticity can lead to imbalance in the parallel environment. Thus, efficient parallel schemes for plasticity are required. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: We propose and investigate formulation and numerical simulation for largely deformable anisotropic reservoirs in this study. We employ the total Lagrangian method (TL) for coupled flow and geomechanics, which does not need to update the coordinate system each time step. The use of the deformation gradient as well as the first and second Piola stresses reflects the change of reservoir configuration, being mathematically equivalent to the updated Lagrangian method. To accurately model full-tensor permeability derived from the Piola transformation in permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA). The total Lagrangian method with MPFA can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling. We thus consider the total Lagrangian method with MPFA as the reference method in this study. Then, we compare it with two other methods: Total Lagrangian method with the two-point flux approximation (TPFA) and infinitesimal transformation assumption with TPFA. From numerical simulation, we find differences between the reference method and the other two methods. Displacement based on the assumption of the infinitesimal transformation is different from that of the total Lagrangian method. Also, we find that volumetric strain and pressure of TL-MPFA are different from those of TL-TPFA. As the anisotropy ratio of permeability increases, the errors between MPFA and TPFA increases. Introduction Small deformation (i.e., infinitesimal transformation) is typically assumed in reservoir geomechanics [1, 2, 3, 4]. This assumption is usually valid in reservoir engineering problems associated with rock, which induce small deformation. However, the assumption might be invalid in largely deformable reservoirs, such as oceanic gas hydrate deposits and fractured/crashed salt domes [5, 6]. Anisotropic reservoirs are profoundly sensitive to substantial changes in reservoir configuration, having full-tensor permeability and elastic moduli during deformation. This causes non-orthogonal grids in flow. However, the modeling of largely deformable anisotropic reservoirs has little been investigated. In this study, we employ the total Lagrangian method for coupled flow and geomechanics. The coordinate system remained fixed both for flow and geomechanics. Instead, the deformation gradient reflects the change of reservoir configuration, which yields mathematical equivalence to the updated Lagrangian method [7, 8, 9]. The total Lagrangian method also induces full-tensor permeability from the Piola transformation, even if the initial permeability tensor is diagonal [11]. To accurately model full-tensor permeability, we use the multi-point flux approximation (MPFA) [12]. Then, the total Lagrangian method with MPFA can provide high accurate and rigorous modeling, honoring the objective stress rates (i.e., Lie derivatives). We thus consider the total Lagrangian method with MPFA as the reference model in this study. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: We modeled microearthquakes (MEQs) for tensile failure of vertical fracture propagation by combining geophysics, flow, and geomechanics simulators while accounting for poromechanical effects. Each time fracturing occurred, we calculated the seismic moment tensor from the obtained displacement field and newly fractured area. Then, using this information, we modeled intensity, location, number of the events, and time of MEQs. We simulated various scenarios, taking single phase flow (i.e., water) in order to remove complex responses from multiphase flow. We first studied a synthetic reservoir having one single shale layer with two strong bounding layers and a horizontal well. The simulated MEQs reflected the propagation of the hydraulic fracture, where the magnitudes of most MEQs were between -1 and -3. Then, we simulated a vertical well in the more realistic geological model of the Arch Forth-Worth Basin, where the Barnett shale is located. We studied two scenarios: one in which the fluid was injected into the Lower Barnett shale and it only fractured into the injected layer, and one in which there was fluid migration from the injection point into the Upper Barnett Shale. The magnitudes of MEQ for these two scenarios were similar and mostly between -0.75 and 0.75 in strength. For all cases, the event locations of MEQs corresponded to the fracture propagation. Thus, the forward simulation of microearthquakes can be a useful to detect propagation of hydraulic fractures and stimulated reservoir volume. Additionally, we showed that under some reservoir conditions it is possible for fluid to fracture layers above the injection point without fracturing the targeted layer. Introduction Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the energy industry for the last decade. This process entails pumping large amounts of sand and water down a well, where the increase in pressure creates a network of fractures that allow petroleum engineers to access trapped hydrocarbons. The operation is poorly understood, so the development of successful hydraulic fracturing methods has been too often a trial and error process. This poses monetary and environmental risks, and a general sense of mistrust towards the oil and gas industry. However, the basics of hydraulic fracturing dictates that a large planar fracture is created in a direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress. In addition to this, a significant number of shear failures (micro-earthquakes) are generated in the surrounding intact reservoir rock [1]. Furthermore, depending on the reservoir on which it is performed, hydraulic fracturing can cause fault reactivation and shear slip of existing natural fractures [2, 3]. The simultaneous combination of these phenomena makes the physics of the problem a difficult subject to study. Nevertheless, because the failure induced by perturbation of fluid pressure implies strong interaction between flow and geomechanics [4], we employed a coupled simulator to accurately predict and assess any risk derived from hydraulic fracturing a vertical well.

                    "abstract": "Abstract: We investigated wellbore stability during hydraulic fracturing using the Mohr-Coulomb failure model and an intrinsic permeability step function for failure status. In order to assess the risk of failure, we varied the values of bottom-hole pressure, permeability multipliers for our permeability step function, and the cohesion values between the well casing and the surrounding cement to represent different quality levels of the cementing operation. Additionally, we studied shear failure for a homogeneous and a heterogeneous three shale layer reservoir. From numerical results, higher bottom-hole pressures increased the fracture propagation speed because it implied higher geomechanical loading. Furthermore, a higher permeability multiplier leads to a larger failed zone because higher permeabilities pressurize the failed zone faster. Also, simulations showed that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality. On the other hand, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and the evolution of long fractures along the vertical well, where they become a factor for potential contamination of aquifers. Moreover, simulations of heterogeneous shale reservoir showed how mechanical properties of the reservoir rock can help resist shear failure of the wellbore. Finally, a coupling strength sensitivity analysis of the steel-cement interface layer demonstrated that higher coupling strengths induce shear failure. Thus, high-quality cement, complete cementing, strong formation rock properties along the vertical well, and low poromechanical effects between fluid and geomechanics appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and contamination hazards to water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing. Introduction The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing can extract enormous quantities of natural gas from previously thought uneconomic reservoirs [1], making shale gas production an important energy resource of the future [2, 3]. However, the extreme low permeability of the shale gas reservoirs requires hydraulic fracturing to enhance productivity [4, 5]. At the same time, environmental impacts induced by hydraulic fracturing have been raised, for example, contamination of ground water, unstable growth of hydraulic fractures, seismic risks, reactivation of existing faults, and soil contamination due to proppant chemicals [6]. The potential environmental impacts have had a negative influence on public opinion, which is curbing and even halting the American shale gas revolution in its tracks. Dusseault et al. (2001) [7] studied compaction-induced shear failure of vertical wells by fluid production. Shear failure is one of the typical mechanisms of well instability. Incomplete cementing between the well and reservoir formations is considered one of the highest environmental risks of ground water contamination, as well as a catalyst for wellbore failure [6, 8]. Pressurization at the bottom of the well causes high shear stress along the vertical well and can result in shear slip at the contacting area between the well casing and the cemented zone if the contacting area is poorly cemented. Cracks from shear failure along the well can be a potential pathway connecting deep shale gas reservoirs to shallow aquifers with higher permeability. "

To this end, we take various values of cohesion between the well casing and the surrounding cement to represent different quality levels of cementing operation (low cohesion corresponds to low-quality cement and/or incomplete cementing). The simulation results show that there is very little fracturing when the cement is of high quality. Conversely, incomplete cementing and/or weak cement can cause significant shear failure and evolution of long fractures/cracks along the vertical well. Specifically, low cohesion between the well and cemented areas can cause significant shear failure along the well, while high cohesion does not cause shear failure. The Biot and thermal dilation coefficients strongly affect shear failure along the well casing, and low Young's modulus causes fast failure propagation. Still, for the high quality of the cementing job, failure propagates very little. When the hydraulic fracturing pressure is high or when permeability increases significantly, low cohesion of the cement can cause fast propagation of shear failure and of the resulting fracture/crack, but a high-quality cement with no weak zones exhibits limited shear failure that is only concentrated near the bottom of the vertical part of the well. Thus, high-quality cement and complete cementing along the vertical well appears to be the strongest protection against shear failure of the wellbore cement and, consequently, against contamination hazards to drinking water aquifers during hydraulic fracturing operations.

From the numerical simulation, we find that tensile fracturing occurs discontinuously in time, which generates saw-toothed responses of pressure, the fracture aperture, and displacement, and that fracture propagation is sensitive to factors such as initial condition of saturation, a type of the injection fluid, heterogeneity, tensile strength, elastic moduli, and permeability models. Gas injection induces faster fracturing in shale gas reservoirs than water injection, for the same mass injection, because of high mobility of gas. However, water injection to highly water-saturated formations can contribute to fast pressurization and high mobility of water, resulting in large fracturing. For moderate initial water saturation, complex physical responses within the fracture result from strong nonlinear permeability and multiphase flow with gravity. Pressure diffusion and pressurization within the fracture are also affected by permeability. High intrinsic and high relative permeabilities result in fast fluid movement of injected fluid, followed by fast fracturing. High Young׳s modulus and high Poisson׳s ratio do not seem favorable to fracture propagation, although they are not significantly sensitive. For heterogeneity, a geological layer of high strength between near surface and above the shale gas reservoirs can prevent vertical fracture propagation, changing the direction of fracturing horizontally.

In this sense, the proposed algorithm is an extension of the fixed stress sequential method in coupled flow and geomechanics. Although fixing the first Piola-Kirchhoff total stress field provides theoretical unconditional stability, we fix the second Piola-Kirchhoff total stress field in this study, based on the assumption that the difference between the two is small, because the constitutive relations are formulated by the second Piola-Kirchhoff total stress. In space discretization, we use the finite element method for mechanics with the total Lagrangian approach scheme, while employing the finite volume method for flow. Geometrical nonlinearity from the total Lagrangian approach results in full-tensor permeability even though the initial permeability is isotropic. To deal with full-tensor permeability, we use the multipoint flux approximation in flow. In time discretization, the backward Euler method is used.

                    "abstract": "We investigate coupled flow and geomechanics in gas production from extremely low-permeability reservoirs such as tight- and shale-gas reservoirs, using dynamic porosity and permeability during numerical simulation. In particular, we take the intrinsic permeability as a step function of the status of material failure, and the permeability is updated every timestep. We consider gas reservoirs with the vertical and horizontal primary fractures, using the single- and dynamic double-porosity (dual-continuum) models. We modify the multiple-porosity constitutive relations for modeling the double porous continua for flow and geomechanics. The numerical results indicate that the production of gas causes redistribution of the effective-stress fields, increasing the effective shear stress and resulting in plasticity. Shear failure occurs not only near the fracture tips but also away from the primary fractures, which indicates generation of secondary fractures. These secondary fractures increase the permeability significantly, and change the flow pattern, which, in turn, causes a change in the distribution of geomechanical variables. From various numerical tests, we find that shear failure is enhanced by a large pressure drop at the production well, a high Biot's coefficient, and low frictional and dilation angles. Smaller spacing between the horizontal wells also contributes to faster secondary fracturing. When the dynamic double-porosity model is used, we observe a faster evolution of the enhanced-permeability areas than that obtained from the single-porosity model, mainly because of a higher permeability of the fractures in the double-porosity model. These complicated physics for stress-sensitive reservoirs cannot properly be captured by the uncoupled or flow-only simulation, and, thus, tightly coupled flow and geomechanical models are highly recommended to describe accurately the reservoir behavior during gas production in tight- and shale-gas reservoirs and to design production scenarios smartly.

Gas hydrate accumulations at this site typically occur in deep water (2157 m) but close to the ocean floor (with their tops 140 mbsf), and are usually characterized by alternating mud (nearly hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis of the short-term production tests focuses on the expected gas production rate and the possibility of subsidence during the limited time of the planned test. The long-term study aims to address the issue of feasibility of long-term production from the hydrates at the test site in terms of production rates and the geomechanical stability of the well assembly and of the reservoir. We investigate several well operation regimes. We evaluate the sensitivity of the system to various flow, thermal, and geomechanical properties, and we account for the interdependence of flow and geomechanical properties. We estimate possible subsidence under production and we determine the conditions that have the potential to lead to wellbore and formation failure, thus defining the envelope of well operations and production conditions that maximize safe gas production.

First, we identify the proper definition of effective stress in multiphase-fluid systems. Although the average pore-pressure p¯--defined as the sum of the product of saturation and pressure of all the fluid phases that occupy the pore space--is commonly used to describe multiphase-fluid flow in deformable porous media, it can be shown that the'equivalent' pore pressure pE --defined as p¯ minusthe interfacial energy--is the appropriate quantity (Coussy 2004). We show, bymeans of a fully implicit analysis of the system, that only the equivalent porepressure pE leads to a continuum problem that is thermodynamically stable (thus, numerical discretizations on the basis of the average pore pressure p¯ cannot render unconditionally stable and convergent schemes). We then study the convergence and stability properties of sequential-implicit coupling strategies. We show that the stability and convergence properties of sequential-implicit coupling strategies for single-phase flow carry over for multiphase systems if the equivalent pore pressure pE is used. Specifically, the undrained and fixed-stress schemes are unconditionally stable, and the fixed-stress split is superior to the undrained approach in terms of convergence rate. The findings from stability theory are verified by use of nonlinear simulations of two-phase flow in deformable reservoirs. "

Modeling of the vertical fracture development involves continuous updating of the boundary conditions and of the data connectivity, based on the finite element method for geomechanics. The T+M simulator can model the initial fracture development during the hydraulic fracturing operations, after which the domain description changes from single continuum to double or multiple continua in order to rigorously model both flow and geomechanics for fracture–rock matrix systems. The T+H simulator provides two-way coupling between fluid-heat flow and geomechanics, accounting for thermo-poro-mechanics, treats nonlinear permeability and geomechanical moduli explicitly, and dynamically tracks changes in the fracture(s) and in the pore volume. We also fully account for leak-off in all directions during hydraulic fracturing. We first test the T+M simulator, matching numerical solutions with the analytical solutions for poromechanical effects, static fractures, and fracture propagations. Then, from numerical simulation of various cases of the planar fracture propagation, shear failure can limit the vertical fracture propagation of tensile failure, because of leak-off into the reservoirs. Slow injection causes more leak-off, compared with fast injection, when the same amount of fluid is injected. Changes in initial total stress and contributions of shear effective stress to tensile failure can also affect formation of the fractured areas, and the geomechanical responses are still well-posed.

The 20 m-thick system is in deep water (2160 m) but close to the ocean floor (with its top at 140 mbsf), and is characterized by alternating mud (near hydrate-free) and sand (hydrate-rich) layers. The layered stratigraphy and the presence of mud layers preclude the use of horizontal wells and necessitate vertical wells. The analysis indicates that production from such a hydrate accumulation is feasible, but the production rates are generally modest. The production rate Qp peaks at about 1.45 ST m3/s=4.4 MMSCFD at about t=1 year, and continuously declines afterward. Sensitivity analysis indicates that cumulative production increases with a declining initial hydrate saturation, an increasing intrinsic permeability of the sand layers and an increasing thermal conductivity of the porous media, while the effect of porosity is non-monotonic: production initially increases with a decreasing porosity, but the trend is later reversed. However, the sensitivity to these parameters is limited, and does not alter the overall predictions of modest production potential. The geomechanical situation appears challenging, as significant subsidence (exceeding 3.5 m at a depth of 20 m below the sea floor, and 1.5 m at the top of the hydrate deposit) is estimated to occur along a large part of the wellbore, and yielding and failure within the 20 m-thick system are possible early in the production process. However, there is significant uncertainty in the predictions of the geomechanical system behavior because they are not based on measured system properties but only on estimates/assumptions from analogs.

In order to analyze coupled flow and geomechanics more rigorously we employ two-way coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, and compare the results with those from one-way coupling used in previous studies, where two-way coupling accounts for changes in pore volume induced by geomechanics, while one-way coupling does not. We find clear differences in the variables of flow and geomechanics between one-way and two-way couplings in this field case (e.g., pressure and effective stress). Using geomechanical properties used previously for the PBU-L 106 C unit, we find that the effective stresses are within the elastic region, located away from the Mohr–Coulomb yield function for both vertical and horizontal well production scenarios. This indicates that there is little danger in geomechanical instability and failure. We also investigate vertical displacement to assess well stability, using two-way coupling. The results from the vertical well scenario show small vertical displacement, from which we anticipate that the vertical well will be stable and safe. On the other hand, the horizontal well scenario causes larger subsidence for a given simulation time because of higher production rates. Even in the case that the hydrates are completely dissociated and the aqueous phase pressure is equilibrated with the constant bottom hole pressure, the estimates of the maximum vertical displacement and strain are 73 cm and 2%, respectively, which do not appear to be a danger of potential well failure. Based on the results and analyses, the horizontal well production is feasible for gas production from the hydrate layers of Unit C in the PBU-L 106 site. But the reservoir model used in this study is relatively generalized. Thus, a specific reservoir model for the site will be required for higher accuracy in the future, after we obtain accurately measured geomechanical data and failure models. "

                    "abstract": "Coupled flow and geomechanics play an important role in the analysis of gas-hydrate reservoirs under production. The stiffness of the rock skeleton and the deformation of the reservoir, as well as porosity and permeability, are directly influenced by (and interrelated with) changes in pressure and temperature and in fluid- (water and gas) and solid- (hydrate and ice) phase saturations. Fluid and solid phases may coexist, which, coupled with steep temperature and pressure gradients, results in strong nonlinearities in the coupled flow and mechanics processes, making the description of system behavior in dissociating hydrate deposits exceptionally complicated. In previous studies, the geological stability of hydrate-bearing sediments was investigated using one-way coupled analysis, in which the changes in fluid properties affect mechanics within the gas-hydrate reservoirs, but with no feedback from geomechanics to fluid flow. In this paper, we develop and test a rigorous two-way coupling between fluid flow and geomechanics, in which the solutions from mechanics are reflected in the solution of the flow problem through the adjustment of affected hydraulic properties. We employ the fixed-stress split method, which results in a convergent sequential implicit scheme. In this study of several hydrate-reservoir cases, we find noticeable differences between the results from one- and two-way couplings. The nature of the elliptic boundary value problem of quasistatic mechanics results in instantaneous compaction or dilation over the domain through loading from reservoir-fluid production. This induces a pressure rise or drop at early times (low-pressure diffusion), and consequently changes the effective stress instantaneously, possibly causing geological instability. Additionally, the pressure and temperature regime affects the various phase saturations, the rock stiffness, porosity, and permeability, thus affecting the fluid-flow regime. These changes are not captured accurately by the simpler one-way coupling. The tightly coupled sequential approach we propose provides a rigorous, two-way coupling model that captures the interrelationship between geomechanical and flow properties and processes, accurately describes the system behavior, and can be readily applied to large-scale problems of hydrate behavior in geologic media.

We consider slow deformations, so that inertia is negligible and the mechanical problem is governed by an elliptic equation. We use Biot’s self-consistent theory to obtain the classical parabolic-type flow problem. We use a generalized midpoint rule (parameter α between 0 and 1) time discretization, and consider two classical sequential methods: the drained and undrained splits. The von Neumann method provides sharp stability estimates for the linear poroelasticity problem. The drained split with backward Euler time discretization (α = 1) is conditionally stable, and its stability depends only on the coupling strength, and it is independent of time step size. The drained split with the midpoint rule (α = 0.5) is unconditionally unstable. The mixed time discretization, with α = 1.0 for mechanics and α = 0.5 for flow, has the same stability properties as the backward Euler scheme. The von Neumann method indicates that the undrained split is unconditionally stable when α ⩾ 0.5. We extend the stability analysis to the nonlinear regime (poro-elastoplasticity) via the energy method. It is well known that the drained split does not inherit the contractivity property of the continuum problem, thereby precluding unconditional stability. For the undrained split we show that it is B-stable (therefore unconditionally stable at the algorithmic level) when α ⩾ 0.5. We also analyze convergence of the drained and undrained splits, and derive the a priori error estimates from matrix algebra and spectral analysis. We show that the drained split with a fixed number of iterations is not convergent even when it is stable. The undrained split with a fixed number of iterations is convergent for a compressible system (i.e., finite Biot modulus). For a nearly-incompressible system (i.e., very large Biot modulus), the undrained split loses first-order accuracy, and becomes non-convergent in time. We also study the rate of convergence of both splits when they are used in a fully-iterated sequential scheme. When the medium permeability is high or the time step size is large, which corresponds to a high diffusion of pressure, the error amplification of the drained split is lower and therefore converges faster than the undrained split. The situation is reversed in the case of low permeability and small time step size. We provide numerical experiments supporting all the stability and convergence estimates of the drained and undrained splits, in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We also show that our spatial discretization (finite volumes for flow and finite elements for mechanics) removes the well-documented spurious instability in consolidation problems at early times. "

We employ the von Neumann and energy methods for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively. We consider two sequential methods with the generalized midpoint rule for tn+α, where α is the parameter of time discretization: namely, the fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits. The von Neumann method indicates that the fixed-strain split is only conditionally stable, and that its stability limit is a coupling strength less than unity if α ⩾ 0.5. On the other hand, the fixed-stress split is unconditionally stable when α ⩾ 0.5, the amplification factors of the fixed-stress split are different from those of the undrained split and are identical to the fully coupled method. Unconditional stability of the fixed-stress split is also obtained from the energy method for poroelastoplasticity. We show that the fixed-stress split is contractive and B-stable when α ⩾ 0.5. We also estimate the convergence behaviors for the two sequential methods by the matrix based and spectral analyses for the backward Euler method in time. From the estimates, the fixed-strain split may not be convergent with a fixed number of iterations particularly around the stability limit even though it is stable. The fixed-stress split, however, is convergent for a fixed number of iterations, showing better accuracy than the undrained split. Even when we cannot obtain the exact local bulk modulus (or exact rock compressibility) at the flow step a priori due to complex boundary conditions or the nonlinearity of the materials, the fixed-stress split can still provide stability and convergence by an appropriate estimation of the local bulk modulus, such as the dimension-based estimation, by which the employed local bulk modulus is less stiff than the exact local bulk modulus.

We analyse four different operator-split strategies: two schemes in which the mechanical problem is solved first (drained and undrained splits), and two schemes where the flow problem is solved first (fixed-strain and fixed-stress splits). We use the Van Neumann method to obtain sharp stability criteria. The drained and fixed-strain splits, which are commonly used, are only conditionally stable. Their stability limits are independent of time step size and depend only on the strength of the coupling between flow and mechanics. This implies that problems with strong coupling cannot be solved by the drained or fixed-strain split methods. Moreover, oscillations in the solution by the drained and fixed-strain split methods can occur even when the stability limit is honored. For problems where the deformation may be plastic in nature, the drained and fixed-strain sequential schemes suffer from severe stability problems when the system enters the plastic regime. However, the undrained and fixed-stress splitting methods are unconditionally stable regardless of the coupling strength, and they do not suffer from oscillations. We also show that the drained and fixed-strain split methods with a fixed number of iterations are inconsistent. That is, they converge to the wrong solution as the time step size goes to zero. On the other hand, the fully coupled, undrained, and fixed-stress methods are consistent even in the case of a single iteration per time step. While both the undrained and fixed-stress schemes are stable, the fixed-stress method is more accurate for a given number of iterations than the undrained method. As a result, we strongly recommend the fixed-stress split. These results have immediate and widespread applicability in the design of reservoir flow simulators that account for geomechanics. Introduction Reservoir geomechanics is concerned with the study of fluid flow and the mechanical response of the reservoir. Reservoir geomechanical behavior plays a critical role in compaction drive, subsidence, well failure, stress dependent permeability, as well as tar sand and heavy oil production (see e.g. Lewis and Sukirman (1993); Settari and Mourits (1998); Settari and Walters (2001); Thomas et al. (2003); Li and Chalaturnyk (2005); Dean et al. (2006); Jha and Juanes (2007)). However, the reservoir simulation community has traditionally emphasized flow modeling and oversimplified the mechanical response through the use of the rock compressibility, taken as a constant coefficient or a simple function of porosity. In order to quantify the deformation and stress fields due to changes in the fluid pressure field, and to account for stress dependent permeability, rigorous and efficient modeling of the coupling between flow and geomechanics is required. In recent years, the interactions between flow and geomechanics have been modeled using various coupling schemes (Settari and Mourits, 1998; Settari and Walters, 2001; Mainguy and Longeumare, 2002; Minkoff et al., 2003; Thomas et al., 2003; Tran et al., 2004, 2005; Dean et al., 2006; Hua and Juanes, 2007). Coupling methods are classified into four types: fully coupled, iteratively coupled, explicitly coupled, and loosely coupled (Settari and Walters, 2001; Dean et al., 2006). The characteristics of the coupling methods are: "

At Mount Elbert we investigated a potential production test from a single 37 ft thick hydrate layer (the Unit D formation) that extends from a depth of 2023 to 2060 ft. At PBU-L106 we analyzed a potential production test within the C-layer, which extends 148 ft from a depth of 2226 to 2374 ft, and is characterized by two hydrate-bearing strata separated by a 30 ft shale interlayer. We use a coupled hydraulic, thermodynamic and geomechanical model simulating 3 years of production from single vertical or horizontal wells (constant pressure Pw = 3 MPa). The analysis shows that most stress changes occurs rapidly (within tens of days) near the wellbore and then progressively away from the wellbore along with the reservoir pressure depletion. Consequently, a few years long test would be sufficient for the stress changes to fully develop and would not change much further around the well bore region, even if the production would be continued for tens of years. The reservoir deformations and surface subsidence on the other hand progresses more gradually with time and is restricted by an arching effect of the overburden. The simulation results show larger subsidence for a production test at Prudhoe Bay L-Pad vicinity, because of a larger hydrate thickness. However, the results indicated about 5 cm compaction of reservoir intervals, which corresponds to a vertical strain of only about 0.2%, and a negligible ground surface subsidence suggesting little danger for the production well and no significant interference with nearby wells and facilities. The results also indicate limited shear failure in the formation around the well perforation which may require appropriate sand screens to prevent solid production. "

However, very few simulation studies have considered the impact of complex fracture networks on the wettability alteration due to the difficulty in handling the connection between fractures and matrix. Non-uniform fracture networks are difficult to represent using traditional discrete fracture models and local grid refinement (LGR). In this study, we used the Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM) method to simulate wettability alteration in reservoirs with complex fracture networks. In EDFM, the reservoir is discretized with structured grids, and additional grids are created to represent the fractures. Each fracture plane is that is physically embedded inside a matrix grid is discretized by the cell boundaries, and transport coefficients are calculated for those additional grids. We verified our EDFM model against LGR in both oil wet and water wet conditions for relatively uniform geometries, observing good matches in well productivities and pressure responses. Then we performed a series of numerical sensitivity studies to demonstrate the impact of natural fracture networks on the wettability alteration. Our results show that fracture density, sets of fractures, and fracture conductivity significantly affect the well productivity. The matrix permeability also has similar effects. We modified the wettability condition of the activated fracture grids and matrix grids around fractures from oil-wet to water-wet. The impacts of fractures and permeability were greatly amplified in changing from oil-wet to water-wet systems, as occurs when surfactant is added to injected frac water. This study improves our capability in the area of modeling complex fracture networks, and provides meaningful guidance for enhanced oil recovery in shale reservoirs when designing a surfactant injection strategy.

Third, a reduced-order model is constructed, which is used to design a Kalman filter to accurately estimate unmeasurable states. Lastly, model predictive control theory is applied for the design of a feedback control system to achieve uniform proppant concentration across the fracture at the end of pumping by explicitly taking into account the desired fracture geometry, total amount of proppant injected, actuator limitations, and safety considerations. We demonstrate that the proposed control scheme is able to generate a spatial concentration profile which is uniform and close to the target concentration compared to that of the benchmark, Nolte's pumping schedule.

                    "abstract": "Field observations show that natural fractures are commonly presented in unconventional reservoirs, acting as planes of weakness that divert hydraulic fracture propagation and generate complex fracture geometry. We systematically investigated the impacts of natural fractures on net injection pressure, fracture geometry, fluid volume distribution, and induced stresses using a complex fracture propagation model. The model fully couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fractures, perforations, and the wellbore. A simplified three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method is used to calculate multiple fracture interaction within stages as well as between stages and wells. Fluid volume distribution between each fracture is automatically calculated during pumping based on fluid resistance. The simulation results show that when a hydraulic fracture diverts into a natural fracture, the net injection pressure is elevated, resulting in width enlargement of the fracture segment before the natural fracture and reduction of total fracture length. Much less fluid flows into the fracture wing that diverts into the natural fracture. Due to a larger compressional stress exerting on the natural fracture, fracture width of the fracture segment on the natural fracture is restricted, which significantly affects proppant transport and distribution. Additionally, differential stress, approach angle, length of natural fractures, and relative position of natural fractures are critical parameters affecting elevation of net injection pressure as well as fracture width enlargement and restriction before and on natural fractures. As differential stress and approach angle increase, higher net injection pressure is required, shorter fracture length is created, and width enlargement and restriction before and on natural fractures are more severe. Deviation of fracture propagation from the original path is greatly affected by the length of natural fractures. The larger the natural fracture, the more deviation from the original path. This study highlights the behaviors of a hydraulic fracture diverting into a natural fracture and the final fracture geometry. "

Fracture propagation in such formations usually induced complex fracture geometry with primary vertical fractures and horizontal fracture segments between layers. Although numerous numerical models have been developed to simulate fracture propagation in unconventional reservoirs, relatively few physical three-dimensional models exist to quantitatively simulate opening of fractures affected by weak interfaces. In this paper, we analyze width profile of fractures and interaction of vertical and horizontal fracture segments with predetermined fracture path under the assumption of neglecting the flow effect. A fully three-dimensional displacement discontinuity method (3D DDM) is introduced to model multiple fractures in a stage in three dimensions. The fracture geometry is prescribed, which combined with vertical and horizontal fractures. In each case, the horizontal fracture is regarded as opening of the bedding interface and vertical fracture would either be arrested or directly cross the interface. Interfacial sliding distance, defined as width jump of the vertical fracture at the interface, is regarded as a primary impact of fracture height containment. Analysis of fracture opening, shear displacements and interfacial sliding distance is given for both vertical and horizontal fracture segments. When multiple vertical fractures intersect with a horizontal interface, shear displacements are induced on the interface and vertical fractures have smaller width compared with the case without the horizontal interface, as a result of the interaction with the interface. We observed that both widths of fracture segments and interfacial sliding distance are positively correlated with the distance between the center of the vertical fracture and the horizontal interface, half-length of horizontal fracture segment, the net pressure within fracture segments. Conversely, Young's Modulus has a negative relationship with both width of fracture segments and interfacial sliding distance. This paper analyzes the effects of opening of weak interfaces and provides critical insights of fracture width distribution and its impacts on proppant transport. "

Although numerous experimental and numerical studies have proven the potential of CO2 Huff-n-Puff, relatively few numerical compositional models exist to comprehensively and efficiently simulate and evaluate CO2 Huff-n-Puff considering CO2 molecular diffusion, nanopore confinement, and complex fractures based on an actual tight-oil well. The objective of this study is to introduce a numerical compositional model with an embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) method to simulate CO2 Huff-n-Puff in an actual Eagle Ford tight oil well. Through non-neighboring connections, the EDFM method can properly and efficiently handle any complex fracture geometries without the need of local grid refinement (LGR) nearby fractures. Based on the actual Eagle Ford well, we build a 3D reservoir model including one horizontal well and multiple hydraulic and natural fractures. Six fluid pseudocomponents were considered. We performed history matching with measured flow rates and bottomhole pressure using the EDFM and LGR methods. The comparison results show that a good history match was obtained and a great agreement between EDFM and LGR was achieved. However, the EDFM method performs faster than the LGR method. After history matching, we evaluated the CO2 Huff-n-Puff effectiveness considering CO2 molecular diffusion and nanopore confinement. The traditional phase equilibrium calculation was modified to calculate the critical fluid properties with nanopore confinement. The simulation results show that the CO2 Huff-n-Puff with smaller CO2 diffusion coefficients underperforms the primary production without CO2 injection; nevertheless, the CO2 Huff-n-Puff with larger CO2 diffusion coefficients performs better than the primary production. In addition, both CO2 molecular diffusion and nanopore confinement are favorable for the CO2 Huff-n-Puff effectiveness. The relative increase of cumulative oil production after 7300 days with CO2 diffusion coefficient of 0.01 cm2/s and nanopore size of 10 nm is about 12% for this actual Eagle Ford well. Furthermore, when considering complex natural fractures, the relative increase of cumulative oil production is about 8%. This study provides critical insights into a better understanding of the impacts of CO2 molecular diffusion, nanopore confinement, and complex natural fractures on well performance during CO2 Huff-n-Puff process in the Eagle Ford tight oil reservoirs.

However, this information is not available in many real-world applications, and therefore, the approach is not generally applicable. To overcome this challenge, we introduce sparse proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD)-Galerkin methodology that exploits the key features of ridge and lasso regularization techniques for the model order reduction of such systems.

Reservoir performance and pressure characterization in multi-stage fracture development considering elastic rock mechanics are not systematically discussed in the literature. This work considers effects of elastic rock mechanics and hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoir development scenarios using a numerical model with coupled fluid flow and geomechanics. A fully coupled flow and geomechanics model based on finite element method is introduced to analyze shale gas flow and corresponding pressure distribution in unconventional reservoirs. The model is validated with an analytical solution and history matched with field data. Furthermore, effects of rock mechanics, elastic properties, and hydraulic fracture geometry on reservoir performance and pressure distribution are studied using the fully coupled numerical model. Pressure distribution and reservoir performance in terms of production rates of these scenarios are analyzed. It is found that consideration of elastic rock mechanics decreases the hydrocarbon production rates and alters the pressure distribution in the unconventional reservoir. Rock mechanical properties and fracture spacing/length also affect flow rates and pressure. Fracture spacing, fracture length, and Young's modulus have the greatest effect on hydrocarbon production rates. Effects of elastic rock mechanics are most significant at central areas of the fractured region, while such effects are less significant at far ends of the horizontal wellbore. This work incorporates full geomechanics with a flow model to understand reservoir performance and pressure characterization in multi-stage hydraulic fracture development scenarios and quantifies effects of geomechanics and effects of various parameters in unconventional development scenarios.

                    "abstract": "Well interference is a common phenomenon between wells observed in unconventional reservoirs, which has received significant attention. It plays an important role in well-spacing considerations. Massive hydraulic fractures are generated in horizontal wells by multistage hydraulic-fracturing treatments and result in well interference between adjacent wells. However, very little work has been completed to understand how massive fractures cause well interference. In this study, we analyzed dynamic-stress evolution and multiple-fracture propagation from two horizontal wells to improve understanding of fracture hits. We used our newly developed nonplanar hydraulic-fracturing model that couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. Fracture propagation in a stage is controlled by stress-shadow effects and flow-rate distribution between fractures. Fracture interaction within a stage and from adjacent wells is considered through a simplified 3D displacement discontinuity method. Well interference is well communication caused by fracture hits. Because of varying stress reorientation, fractures propagate toward each other from two adjacent wells, and fracture tips always tend to converge with each other and decrease fracture distance, which promotes fracture coalescence. For plug-and-perforate completion, multiple fractures in a stage generally cannot uniformly develop. Dominant fractures with extremely long length are often generated and hit fractures from adjacent wells. Fracture hits and well interference are induced by these two mechanisms, which are affected by fracture spacing and the differential stress (DS) of reservoirs. Results show that the larger the fracturing spacing is, the smaller the likelihood is to induce fracture connection. A large DS can prevent fractures from deviating from their original paths. For a reservoir with a large DS, fracture hits can be decreased with a stagger distance of fractures between two wells. This work uses a hydraulic-fracturing model to analyze fracture geometry between two horizontal wells and offers improved understanding of fracture connection. The results of the study provide critical insights to improve well interference and to optimize well spacing and design of multiwell completion techniques. "

                    "abstract": "Stress changes associated with reservoir depletion are often observed in the field. Stress evolution within and surrounding drainage areas can greatly affect further reservoir developments, such as completion of infill wells and refracturing. Previous studies mainly focus on biwing planar-fracture geometry, which limits the possibility of investigating stress evolution caused by complex-fracture geometry. In this paper, we have developed a novel and efficient coupled fluid-flow/geomechanics model with an embedding-discrete-fracture model (EDFM) to characterize stress evolution associated with depletion in unconventional reservoirs with complex-fracture geometry. Coupled geomechanics/fluid flow was developed using the well-known fixed-stress-split method, which is unconditionally stable and computationally efficient to simulate how stress changes during reservoir depletion. EDFM was coupled to the model to gain capability of simulating complex-fracture geometries using structured grids. The model was validated against the classical Terzaghi (1925) and Mandel (1953) problems. Local grid refinement was used as a benchmark when comparing results from EDFM for fractures with 0 and 45° angles of inclination. After that, the model was used to analyze stress distribution and reorientation in reservoirs with three different fracture geometries: planar-fracture (90° angle of inclination), 60° inclination, and nonplanar-fracture geometries. As the pressure decreases, reservoir stresses tend to change anisotropically depending on depletion area. The principal stress parallel to the initial fracture reduces faster than the orthogonal one as a function of time. The decrease rate of principal stresses is distinct for different shapes of depleted areas created by different fracture geometries. The rectangular shape produced by the planar-fracture geometry yields the largest stress-reorientation area for a variety of differential-stress (DS) values (difference between two horizontal principal stresses). The squared shape produced by nonplanar-fracture geometry yields stress reorientation only for low DS. The results indicate that created fracture geometry has a significant effect on stress distribution and reorientation induced by depletion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a coupled fluid-flow/geomechanics model incorporated with EDFM has been developed to efficiently calculate stress evolution in reservoirs with complex-fracture geometry. Characterization of stress evolution will provide critical guidelines for optimization of completion designs and further reservoir development. "

First, the current models are challenging to efficiently handle the complex nonplanar fractures with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length caused by very-complicated gridding issues, a high computational cost, and complexities in development of computational codes. Second, the conventional gas-diffusivity equation needs to be revised to include all important gas-transport mechanisms such as gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption. Hence, the goal of this study was to develop a new model to fill this gap. We present an efficient semianalytical model by dividing fractures into several fracture segments to represent the complex nonplanar-fracture geometry and present a revised diffusivity equation to consider all the important gas-transport mechanisms for shale-gas reservoirs. We verified this model against a numerical reservoir simulator and an analytical solution for a single planar fracture. Transient-flow behavior between planar fractures and nonplanar fractures with and without considering the natural fractures was compared. Furthermore, a well with actual production data from the Marcellus Shale was analyzed. First, we use a complex hydraulic-fracture-propagation model to generate nonplanarfracture geometry. Then, we apply the fracture geometry in the semianalytical model to evaluate well performance. Contributions of each mechanism to gas recovery are examined. By use of history matching and production forecasting, the difference of cumulative gas production between the nonplanar fractures and the converted planar fractures with equal fracture length is approximately 12% at 30 years of production. In addition, the contribution of gas diffusion, gas slippage, and gas desorption to gas recovery at 30 years of production compared with that without considering them is approximately 11, 16, and 25%, respectively. In total, the contribution of these three important mechanisms is approximately 56%. Hence, modeling of gas production from the nonplanar fractures and modeling the important gas-transport mechanisms in shale-gas reservoirs are significant. "

                    "abstract": "Multistage hydraulic fracturing, together with horizontal drilling, plays an important role in the economic development of unconventional reservoirs. However, according to field analysis of stimulation effectiveness, only a small percentage of perforation clusters contribute to most of the well production. One reason for this low effectiveness is that multiple fractures do not take the same amount of fluid and proppant because of the interaction between hydraulic fractures (i.e., stress-shadow effects). Unfortunately, how best to minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing is still not fully understood in the petroleum industry. In this paper, we analyze this problem to promote more-uniform fracture growth by use of a complex hydraulic-fracture-development model. We use our fracture-propagation model, which couples rock deformation and fluid flow in the fracture and horizontal wellbore. The model assumes homogeneous linear-elastic rock medium and does not consider proppant transport in multiple fractures. Partitioning of flow rate between multiple fractures is calculated by use of the principles of flow through an electric-circuit network. Fracture development is dominated by flow-rate distribution, which is controlled by flow resistance within the fractures. For simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation, nonuniform flow-rate distribution is induced because stress-shadow effects exert additional flow resistance on the interior fractures. To balance the extra resistance introduced by the effects, we investigated two adjustment approaches to promote uniform fracture development. The first approach was to adjust perforation number or diameter to increase flow resistance entering the exterior fractures. The second was to mitigate stress-shadow effects through management of nonuniform fracture spacing. We found that decreasing perforation diameter or the number of exterior fractures can divert fluid into the interior fractures and promote even fracture growth. Stress-shadow effects can be mitigated by moving the two interior fractures away from each other and toward the exterior fractures. The key mechanism is to maintain even flow resistance within each fracture and facilitate fractures to obtain the same amount of injection fluid. Furthermore, flow resistance is affected by near-wellbore fracture tortuosity, natural fractures, and stress heterogeneity in the reservoirs. These factors might also be effectively controlled by adding extra flow resistance to pass perforations, provided that this extra resistance is larger than the extra resistance introduced by the factors. This work analyzes the problem of uneven development of multiple fractures along the horizontal wellbore and provides new insights into how to control simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation. It offers potential approaches for engineers to apply in the field to optimize hydraulic-fracturing-treatment design, thereby maximizing well production cost-effectively. "

Through non-neighboring connections, the EDFM can properly handle complex fracture geometries such as non-planar hydraulic fractures and a large amount of natural fractures. Based on public data for Eagle Ford shale oil, we build a reservoir model including up to three horizontal wells and five fluid pseudocomponents. The simulation results show that the connecting hydraulic fractures play a more important role than natural fractures in declining bottomhole pressure (BHP) of the shut-in well. Matrix permeability has a relatively minor impact on pressure drawdown and well productivity remains little affected due to the overall low permeability used. The BHP pressure decline profiles change from convex to concave when the conductivity of the connecting fractures increases. At early times, the BHP of the shut-in well decreases when the number of natural fractures increases. At later times, the natural fracture density has a lesser impact on the pressure response and no clear trend. The opening order of neighboring wells affects the well interference intensity between the target shut-in well with the surrounding wells. After a systematic investigation of pressure drawdown in the reservoir we formulate practical conclusions for improved production performance. "

Accurate characterization of fracture complexity plays an important role in optimizing fracturing design, especially for shale reservoirs with high-density NFs. In this study, we simulated simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation within a single fracturing stage by use of a complex HF-development model. The model was developed to simulate complex fracture propagation by coupling rock mechanics and fluid mechanics. A simplified 3D displacement-discontinuity method (DDM) was implemented to more accurately calculate fracture displacements and fracture-induced dynamic-stress changes than our previously developed pseudo-3D model. The effects of perforation-cluster spacing, differential stress (SHmax–Shmin), and the geometry of various NF patterns on injection pressure and fracture complexity were investigated. The single-stage simulation results show that (1) higher differential stress suppresses fracture length and increases injection pressure; (2) there is an optimal choice for the number of fractures per stage to maximize effective fracture-surface contact area, beyond which increasing the number of fractures actually decreases effective fracture area; and (3) fracture complexity is a function of NF patterns (various regular-pattern geometries were investigated). NFs with small relative angle to HFs are more likely to control the fracture-propagation path. Also, NF patterns with more long fractures tend to increase the likelihood to dominate the preferential fracture trend of fracture trajectory. Our numerical model can provide a physics-based complex fracture network that can be imported into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis.

To increase the effective fracture number and improve the effectiveness of stimulation treatments, the key is to promote uniform flow volume distribution and fracture growth. In this paper, a series of case studies were investigated to analyze the effects of fluid viscosity, injection rate, fracture spacing, differential stress (SHmax - Shmin), and Young's modulus on simultaneous three-fracture propagation by employing an in-house developed fracture propagation model (XFRAC). The results demonstrated that increasing flow viscosity increases the difference of flow rate between fractures, resulting in less fluid received by the interior fracture. Large injection rate can promote more uniform fracture development. Small fracture spacing implies strong stress shadow effects, which results in large variation of flow volume into each fracture. Differential stress can alter the partitioning of flow volume between fractures. Large differential stress restricts a fracture growing along a straight line. Young's modulus has significant impacts on hydraulic fracture propagation. Numerical results shown that the rock formations with small Young's modulus favor uniform fracture geometry. This work analyzed how parameters affect multiple fracture propagation and provided critical guidelines for engineers to improve the effectiveness of multi-stage fracturing treatments. Introduction Hydraulic fractures coupled with horizontal wells have become a standard technology to effectively develop unconventional reservoirs. Plug and perf. limited entry completion technology is being widely used to generate massive hydraulic fractures along horizontal wellbore. Generally, 2-6 perforation clusters in one stage are created with the purpose of simultaneously generating 2-6 similar fractures. However, it is now well established that multiple fractures cannot be uniformly generated along the lateral (Wheaton et al. 2014; Ugueto et al. 2016). Some clusters receive a small proportion of the intended treatment fluid and proppant, resulting in immaturely developed fractures, while some clusters receive more than intended and generate “overdeveloped” fractures. Consequently, production from horizontal wells with plug and perf. completions is highly variable along horizontal wellbore. Miller et al. (2011) analyzed the data of production logs from multiple basins and indicated that one third of all perforation clusters contribute to two thirds of gas production and about one third of the clusters are ineffective and do not contribute to production. According to the data of distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), Sookprasong et al. (2014) concluded that the dominant perforation clusters are often identified during simultaneous stimulation of multiple fractures. Wheaton et al. (2014, 2016) also utilized the data of DAS and DTS to analyze the flow and proppant distribution of multi-cluster fractures and shown the percentages of fluid/proppant existing each cluster through treatment time. The results indicate that multiple perforation clusters cannot receive equal fluid volume, resulting in non-uniform development of fractures. Spain et al. (2015) also pointed out that hydraulic fracturing efficiency in unconventional reservoirs is poor that 40%-60% of perforation clusters contribute little or no production. Ugueto et al. (2016) utilized fiber optic diagnostic to estimate perforation cluster efficiency in cemented plug and perf. limited entry completions. The paper stated that generally only half or two-thirds of the perforation clusters are properly stimulated or produced at significant rates. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: Recently, the Eagle Ford shale has become one of the most heavily targeted shale plays. Optimizing the production from wells targeting this play begins with the hydraulic fracture design. Hydraulic fracturing treatments with closely spaced fractures allows for a large area of the formation to be fractured and produced more efficiently. However, fractures spaced too close together suffer from stress shadow effects, which may cause an inefficient fracture completion. Optimal fracture spacing is a crucial aspect to maximize well production. In this paper, we analyzed pressure data recorded during the hydraulic fracturing process of multi-stage horizontal wells in the Eagle Ford field. A gradual increase in the treatment pressure recorded during each successive stage of fracturing is a strong indicator of a stress shadow induced by the fractures. The wells we studied in the Eagle Ford shale did not show the trend of increasing treatment pressure between stages, which may imply that stage spacing is not within the region of stress shadow influence. Furthermore, the extent of a stress shadow induced by opening fractures can be estimated by an analytical solution based on fracture height. Based on the complex geology of interbedded organic rich marl and limestone in the Eagle Ford shale, and stage spacing, we inferred that fracture height in these wells might be limited by the ductile rock in the formation. Since the fracture height is smaller than the stage spacing, this results in a small extent of stress shadow. Furthermore, we built a reservoir model that matches the wells' production and bottomhole pressure data to further quantify the fracture height. The conclusion we obtained is that interbedded ductile layers inhibit the growth of fracture height, resulting in weak stress shadow effects and uniform, planar fractures generated in the formation. Through this study we can provide some critical guidelines on the stage spacing and perforation cluster spacing of wells in similar geologic settings. Introduction The Eagle Ford has long been known as a source rock for the Austin Chalk and Budda Limestone formations, but has only been targeted as a reservoir itself since 2008. With less than a decade of production, there is still much to learn about the most efficient way to produce this shale formation, which has become one of the most targeted shale plays in North America. The Eagle Ford Shale is a tight formation with very low permeability and the only way for a well targeting the Eagle Ford to be commercially successful is through hydraulic fracturing. Creating fractures in the formation increases the conductive path for hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore. This process is performed in horizontal wells so that a larger area of the reservoir can be targeted per well. The fracturing process is completed in stages, with each stage producing multiple fracture clusters that propagate into individual fractures. Ideally, stages should be spaced as close to one another as possible, since more fractures would increase the contact area between the fractures and the reservoir. Unfortunately, as a consequence of spacing fractures too close together, an increase in stress shadow effects can occur. "

                    "abstract": "In the past several decades, in order to have quick and direct methods to perform production forecasting and reserves estimation in practice, petroleum engineers have designed various techniques to interpolate the production rate both analytically and numerically, among which many decline curve analysis models have been proposed and widely used because of their simplicity and efficiency. Although all decline curve analysis models could be employed in some cases under certain assumptions, each has its own limitations and is not applicable for all cases. With the increasing interest in shale gas reservoirs, engineers have found a common long-tail behavior for gas production profile of shale gas wells, which cannot be well described by the current decline curve models. In this paper, based on the anomalous diffusion phenomena that also have the long-tail behavior, we developed a new fractional decline curve (FDC) model with three fitting parameters using the general solution of the fractional diffusion equations, which is a special case of so-called Mittag-Leffler function. In addition, we proposed a four-step scheme according to the asymptotic properties of the Mittag-Leffler function to quantify the three parameters. We verified the new FDC model against a numerical reservoir model. In addition, we applied the FDC model to perform history matching and production forecasting for five actual shale-gas wells from the Fayetteville Shale. The results show that the new model is easy to use and provides a reliable estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), which can help the petroleum industry to perform data analysis rapidly and forecast production more accurately in shale gas reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "Simultaneous multiple-fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional resources in shale reservoirs. One challenge to efficiently use the technique is the generation of effective hydraulic fractures from all perforation clusters. In this work, we conducted a fundamental study of physical mechanisms controlling simultaneous multiple-fracture propagation and discussed the potential approaches to improve nonuniform development of multiple fractures. This study was investigated by our recently developed 3D fracture-propagation model that captures the coupled elastic deformation of the rock with fluid flow in the horizontal wellbore and within the fractures. The model demonstrated that fracture geometry was controlled by both the stress-shadow effects and dynamic partitioning of flow rate. The analysis results indicated that the nonuniform development of a multiple-fracture array, for example, a three-fracture array in this study, was induced by the uneven partitioning of flow rate into each fracture, which was dependent on the flow resistance from wellbore friction, perforation friction, and fracture propagation. Furthermore, the stress shadowing from the exterior fractures exerted additional stress on the interior fractures and increased the resistance of fracture propagation, resulting in the interior fractures receiving much less fluid. To minimize the negative effects of stress shadowing and favor more-uniform fracture growth, we investigated potential approaches to promote uniform partitioning of flow rate through adjusting the flow resistance between multiple fractures. The results showed that adjusting perforation friction can provide an effective way to modify the partitioning of flow rate and mitigate the negative effects of stress shadowing. The mechanisms investigated in this study are consistent with field observations. Our approach can help field operators to improve the effectiveness of multiple fracturing treatments and maximize the production. "

                    "abstract": "Two key technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have led to the economic production of unconventional resources such as shale gas and tight oil. In reality, a nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability is created during the hydraulic-fracturing process. However, it is challenging to simulate well performance from the nonplanar fracture geometry. For the sake of simplicity, the nonplanar fracture geometry is often represented by ideal planar fracture geometry with constant fracture width, which one can easily handle analytically, semianalytically, and numerically. However, such ideal fracture geometry is inadequate to capture the physics of the transient flow behavior of the nonplanar fracture geometry. Although significant efforts were made in recent years to numerically model well performance from the complex fracture geometry, these approaches are still challenging to model the nonplanar fracture geometry with varying width because of large considerable fracture-gridding issues and an expensive computation cost. In addition, the effect of nonplanar fracture geometry on well productivity and transient flow behavior was not reported in the literature. Hence, a model to handle the nonplanar fracture geometry by considering varying fracture width and fracture permeability is still lacking in the petroleum industry. Zhou et al. (2014) proposed a semianalytical model to handle the complex fracture geometry with constant fracture width. However, the semianalytical model did not consider the effects of stress-dependent fracture conductivity and the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying fracture width along the fracture. In this work, we extended the semianalytical model to simulate production from the nonplanar fracture geometry as well as planar fracture geometry with varying width. In addition, the effect of stress-dependent fracture conductivity was implemented in the model. We verified the semianalytical model against a numerical reservoir simulator for single planar fracture with constant width. We performed two case studies. The first case contains a comparison of two planar fractures, one with constant fracture width and another with varying fracture width. In the second study, we compared two fractures with different fracture geometries such as planar fracture geometry and nonplanar fracture geometry, which were generated from the fracture-propagation model. In addition, transient flow regimes were investigated on the basis of a log-log graph of the dimensionless pressure drop and pressure-drop derivative vs. the dimensionless time. This work can provide critical insights into understanding the well performance from tight oil reservoirs with the nonplanar hydraulic-fracture geometry. "

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe efforts to create a computationally efficient model that is accurate for multiple, three dimensional fracture problems. The accuracy of a fast pseudo-3D method (Olson, 2004) for describing fracture interaction is investigated through comparing with a fully 3D displacement discontinuity method (DDM). Results demonstrate that the pseudo- 3D solution underestimates the mechanical interaction between nearby fractures. The apertures of both interior and exterior fractures given by the pseudo-3D method are larger than the fully 3D solutions. However, 3D DDM is computationally far more expensive than the pseudo-3D method because a) more elements are required to describe a fracture in three dimensions and b) the computational cost per element is higher in 3D. We show that using 1 element in the fracture height direction with the standard 3D equations is unacceptably inaccurate, but by employing an analytically based correction factor, that accuracy can be significantly improved, eliminating the need for extra elements for height-contained hydraulic fracture problems. The higher per element computation cost in 3D is largely the result of the fact that the 3D displacement discontinuity method has three unknowns (opening, strike-slip shear and dip-slip shear). Further speed advantage is gained by dictating all fractures must be vertical, which allows elimination of equation components related to the dip-slip shear. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to problems of multiple hydraulic fracture propagation in horizontal wells. 1. INTRODUCTION In recent years, production of tight oil and shale gas has increased exponentially in the United States. Multiple fracture treatments in horizontal wellbores are becoming a prevalent approach to economically develop unconventional reservoirs. A better understanding of multiple fracture growth is essential for accurately predicting fracture geometry. Mechanical interaction between multiple fractures, also referred to as stress shadow effects, is a critical factor controlling fracture geometry and inducing complex fracture geometry. To better model fracture interaction, an efficient and accuracy method is required. "

                    "abstract": "The combination of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing have boosted the oil production from Bakken tight oil reservoirs. However, the primary oil recovery factor is very low due to the extremely tight formation, resulting in substantial volumes of oil still remaining in place. Hence, it is important to investigate the potential of applying enhanced oil recovery methods to increase oil recovery in the Bakken formation. Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is widely used in conventional reservoirs to improve oil recovery, it is a new subject and not well-understood in unconventional oil reservoirs such as the Bakken formation. In this paper, we use numerical reservoir simulation to model CO2 injection as a huff-n-puff process with typical reservoir and fracture properties from the Bakken formation. Effects of CO2 molecular diffusion, number of cycle, fracture half-length, permeability and reservoir heterogeneity on the well performance of CO2 huff-n-puff are examined in detail. The results show that the CO2 diffusion plays a significant role in improving oil recovery from tight oil reservoirs, which cannot be neglected in the reservoir simulation model. Additionally, the tight oil formation with lower permeability, longer fracture half-length, and more heterogeneity is more favorable for the CO2 huff-n-puff process. This work can provide a better understanding of the physical mechanisms and key parameters affecting the effectiveness of CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken formation. "

Also, many researchers have been working on development of various production-simulation approaches to simulate production from the complex fracture geometries. The objective of this study is to combine the fracture propagation modeling and reservoir simulation to optimize production in shale gas reservoirs. First, we have developed a semi-analytical model to simulate shale gas production from the complex non-planar fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. The important gas transport mechanisms including gas slippage, gas diffusion, and gas desorption are considered. Second, we integrate the semi-analytical model with a three-dimensional fracture propagation model, which fully couples elastic deformation of the rock and fluid flow to simulate complex hydraulic fracture propagation, to optimize fracture treatment design in Marcellus shale gas reservoirs. Specifically, the fracture propagation model is utilized to predict the more-realistic non-planar fracture geometry with varying fracture width and fracture permeability along fracture length. In this study, the effect of varying number of perforation clusters within a given stage ranging from 2 to 5 on the fracture propagation was investigated. Three values of stage spacing were considered including 100 ft, 200 ft, and 300 ft. After predicting the non-planar fracture geometry, the semi-analytical model is employed to simulate production from such fracture geometries. According to the well productivity, the optimal number of clusters per stage for varying stage spacing is discussed and determined. In addition, we compared the well performance with the optimal number of perforation clusters for the stage spacing of 100 ft, 200 ft, and 300 ft under a given horizontal well length of 2,500 ft. Furthermore, we used the integrated approach to analyze a well performance from Marcellus shale gas reservoirs. Through the field case study, the more-realistic non-planar fracture geometry was quantified. Also, the difference between the non-planar fracture geometry and ideal planar fracture geometry with equal fracture width and fracture half-length was compared. Finally, the optimal fracture treatment design for the field well development was recommended. This work can provide new insights into optimization of number of perforation clusters per stage within a given fracture stage and a better understanding of the non-planar fracture geometry in shale gas reservoirs.

Optimizing the stimulation of these wells will require models that can account for the simultaneous propagation of multiple, potentially nonplanar fractures. In this paper, a novel fracture-propagation model (FPM) is described that can simulate multiple-hydraulic-fracture propagation from a horizontal wellbore. The model couples fracture deformation with fluid flow in the fractures and the horizontal wellbore. The displacement discontinuity method (DDM) is used to represent the mechanics of the fractures and their opening, including interaction effects between closely spaced fractures. Fluid flow in the fractures is determined by the lubrication theory. Frictional pressure drop in the wellbore and perforation zones is taken into account by applying Kirchoff’s first and second laws. The fluid-flow rates and pressure compatibility are maintained between the wellbore and the multiple fractures with Newton’s numerical method. The model generates physically realistic multiple-fracture geometries and nonplanar-fracture trajectories that are consistent with physical-laboratory results and inferences drawn from microseismic diagnostic interpretations. One can use the simulation results of the FPM for sensitivity analysis of in-situ and fracture treatment parameters for shale-gas stimulation design. They provide a physics-based complex fracture network that one can import into reservoir-simulation models for production analysis. Furthermore, the results from the model can highlight conditions under which restricted width occurs that could lead to proppant screenout. "

Key design considerations are the spacing between injection zones, the size of the treatments, and the injection parameters (primarily rate and viscosity). Other important parameters are whether to inject into multiple zones simultaneously or sequentially, and whether to coordinate fracturing between multiple adjacent horizontal wells. We investigate various injection scenarios using two different \"pseudo-3d?? boundary element, displacement discontinuity method based hydraulic fracture simulators. A single fracture model couples the injection of non-Newtonian fluid, Carter leak-off behavior, arbitrary non-planar propagation, and height growth in a 3-layered media. The second model is designed to be more computational efficient and stable by simplifying the fracture fluid flow calculation. Fracture pressure variation through time is approximated by summing the inverse of width cubed over the created fracture network, and wellbore pressure is equated to the predicted summative pressure drop in the system. Results indicate that sequential fracturing geometries are highly dependent on injection zone spacing relative to fracture height - when fractures are closely spaced relative to stress shadow size, fracture path diversion and intersection as well as net pressure effects are likely. This strong mechanical interaction scenario promotes fracture complexity (which can be an advantage in some formations), but reduces the penetration distance of fracture wings away from the wellbore. Simultaneous fracturing of multiple stages is also strongly influenced by the spacing to height ratio - the closer the spacing the more difficult it is to get substantial growth from all completed zones.

Dynamic tube blocking tests showed that PEC-entrapped PVS increases the squeeze treatment lifetime by 22% compared to unentrapped PVS. The results also suggest that ionic shocks improve the release of PVS, prolonging the treatment by 40% compared to unentrapped PVS. "

                    "title": "Development of a Powerful Data-Analysis Tool Using Nonparametric Smoothing Models To Identify Drillsites in Tight Shale Reservoirs With High Economic Potential",
                    "abstract": "The oil-and-gas industry is entering an era of “big data” because of the huge number of wells drilled with the rapid development of unconventional oil-and-gas reservoirs during the past decade. The massive amount of data generated presents a great opportunity for the industry to use data-analysis tools to help make informed decisions. The main challenge is the lack of the application of effective and efficient data-analysis tools to analyze and extract useful information for the decision-making process from the enormous amount of data available. In developing tight shale reservoirs, it is critical to have an optimal drilling strategy, thereby minimizing the risk of drilling in areas that would result in low-yield wells. The objective of this study is to develop an effective data-analysis tool capable of dealing with big and complicated data sets to identify hot zones in tight shale reservoirs with the potential to yield highly productive wells. The proposed tool is developed on the basis of nonparametric smoothing models, which are superior to the traditional multiple-linear-regression (MLR) models in both the predictive power and the ability to deal with nonlinear, higher-order variable interactions. This data-analysis tool is capable of handling one response variable and multiple predictor variables. To validate our tool, we used two real data sets—one with 249 tight oil horizontal wells from the Middle Bakken and the other with 2,064 shale gas horizontal wells from the Marcellus Shale. Results from the two case studies revealed that our tool not only can achieve much better predictive power than the traditional MLR models on identifying hot zones in the tight shale reservoirs but also can provide guidance on developing the optimal drilling and completion strategies (e.g., well length and depth, amount of proppant and water injected). By comparing results from the two data sets, we found that our tool can achieve model performance with the big data set (2,064 Marcellus wells) with only four predictor variables that is similar to that with the small data set (249 Bakken wells) with six predictor variables. This implies that, for big data sets, even with a limited number of available predictor variables, our tool can still be very effective in identifying hot zones that would yield highly productive wells. The data sets that we have access to in this study contain very limited completion, geological, and petrophysical information. Results from this study clearly demonstrated that the data-analysis tool is certainly powerful and flexible enough to take advantage of any additional engineering and geology data to allow the operators to gain insights on the impact of these factors on well performance.

Thioglycolic acid modified polyallylamine (PAAm/TGA) and Dihydroxybenzoic acid-Thioglycolic modified polyallylamine (PAAm/TGA/DHBA) were synthesized following a simple conjugation process. These hydrogels exhibit high affinity, low cost, and high re-usability efficiency. The maximum sorption capacities were significantly higher than those sorbents currently in use. The kinetic study of the hydrogels demonstrated that almost 50% removal occurred in less than 5 min. Additionally, the hydrogel exhibited excellent re-usability, maintaining their efficiency in 5 consecutive cycles. These results suggest that these hydrogels can be considered to be potential agents to be used in waste/produced water treatment. "

                    "abstract": "Over the past decade, technological advancements in horizontal drilling and multistage fracturing enable natural gas to be economically produced from tight shale formations. However, because of limited availability of the production data as well as the complex gas-transport mechanisms and fracture geometries, there still exist great uncertainties in production forecasting and reserves estimation for shale gas reservoirs. The rapid pace of shale gas development makes it important to develop a new and efficient probabilistic-based methodology for history matching, production forecasting, reserves estimates, and uncertainty quantification that are critical for the decision-making processes. In this study, we present a new probabilistic approach with the Bayesian methodology combined with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a fractional decline-curve (FDC) model to improve the efficiency and reliability of the uncertainty quantification in well-performance forecasting for shale gas reservoirs. The FDC model not only can effectively capture the long-tail phenomenon of shale gas-production decline curves but also can obtain a narrower range of production prediction than the classical Arps model. To predict the posterior distributions of the decline-curve model parameters, we use a more-efficient adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm in place of the standard Metropolis-Hasting (MH) algorithm. The AM algorithm can form the Markov chain of decline-curve model parameters efficiently by incorporating the correlation between the model parameters. With the predicted posterior distributions of the FDC model parameters generated by the AM algorithm, the uncertainty in production forecasts and estimated-ultimate-recovery (EUR) prediction can then be quantified. This work provides an efficient and robust tool that is based on a new probabilistic approach for production forecasting, reserves estimations, and uncertainty quantification for shale gas reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "The blockage performance of a Cr(III) acetate-HPAM gel was investigated using several different application regimes and gel maturities. Four outcrop core materials were selected, from which cylindrical core plugs were drilled. The core plugs were fractured and assembled with open, longitudinal fractures of 1 mm aperture. Mature and immature gel was placed in the fracture, and for some application regimes in the surrounding matrix, and the blockage performance based on placement method assessed. Mature gel was injected directly into the fracture using several different injection rates and throughput volumes. The cores were thereafter shut-in for 24 hours, after which waterflooding was performed. Immature gel (gelant) was placed in the fracture and adjacent matrix using four different saturation schemes to control gelant saturation. Cross-linking was induced at an elevated temperature, and the cores remained shut-in for 24 hours (five times the gelation time) at this temperature before waterflooding. The rupture pressure, the given pressure at which the gel allowed water to pass through the fracture, was recorded during subsequent brine injection and was used to describe gel blocking ability. Residual resistance factors (RRF) were also recorded and are discussed for both treatment options. The rupture pressures of mature gel were predictable and stable in all the core materials studied over a wide variety of gel injection rates and throughput volumes. Injecting gelant and aging the gel in-situ yielded varying results, depending on core material and matrix saturation, and gel was not formed in many Bentheimer sandstone cores. The highest rupture pressures achieved were comparable for mature gel injection and gel cross-linked in-situ. Significant permeability reduction was achieved after throughput of tens of fracture volumes of water, averaging a factor 5000 for cores treated with formed gel and 600 for cores where gel was cross-linked in-situ. The significance of these observations to field applications will be discussed. "

                    "abstract": "Slow drilling in deep shale formations leads to a considerable expenditure to the petroleum industry. An important factor that contributes to slow penetration rate is bit balling in water-reactive shale formations. Bit balling is recognized as the major reason for inefficient performance of the bit while drilling shaly formations. The corresponding research centers and industry are always interested in finding practical solutions to mitigate bit balling associated with slow shale drilling. In this study, three well-performing and robust pattern recognition techniques including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and neural network pattern recognition (NNPR) are presented for problem identification in drilling engineering. Each method constructs three structures considering important inputs: normalized rate of penetration, depth of cut, specific energy, and cation exchange capacity to diagnose effective bit cleaning in shale formations of the Southern Oil Field in Iran. The models correlate operational parameters to cation exchange capacity to determine whether effective bit cleaning (reversal of balling) or ineffective cleaning (irreversible balling) is taking place. The common evaluation approaches include cross penalty error, confusion matrix output, area under the curve (AUC), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to evaluate efficiency of the multi-strategy classifier. These indicators provide useful information on the number of classified and misclassified cases, global accuracy, and discriminatory ability of diagnostic tests. We show that pattern recognition methods can assure both stability and high accuracy in classification situations. "

                    "abstract": "Summary Design of drilling fluids, spacers, cement slurries, and fracturing fluids is often done by trial and error in the laboratory. In the first step, the required properties of these fluids are categorized and then efforts will be started with a rough idea of the optimal composition. This first guess usually depends on the experience of the laboratory analyst or fluid engineer. Afterward, the trial-and-error testing starts, and it continues until the fluid design moves closer to the desired fluid criteria. There are several test data that would not be used in this method, and it is difficult to digest a large amount of information by the user. Trial and error could be time-consuming, very costly, and misleading. Today, there is a need for an intelligent system that uses all the available data (big data), even if the data sets are not close to the desired goal, and offers insights for fluid designs. This paper conducted a study on the application of machine-learning-based methodologies, including Gaussian-process regression (GPR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), to reduce the costs of testing, integrate available experimental data, and eliminate the need for personnel supervision. These practical nonlinear-regression methods empower efficient and fast prediction tools that do not require including complex physics of the underlying system while integrating all available data from different sources. GPR, which is also known as Kriging in geostatistics literature, has exceptional advantages over traditional regression methods because it does not require a known form for regression function and also has the capability of determining the estimation error and the confidence interval. This machine-learning-based tool offers insights for intelligent fluid design and could reduce costs. "

Nanofluids are engineered colloidal suspensions of nano-sized particles dispersed in a basefluid. The rheological characteristics of nanofluids are studied with pressures up to 100 MPa and particle concentrations up to 8% by mass using a high-pressure viscometer. The addition of nanoparticles is observed to increase the apparent viscosity of the nanofluids. A non-Newtonian, shear-thinning behavior is observed for both the basefluid and the nanofluids at all pressures at the higher shear rates. The critical shear rate at which shear thinning occurs is observed to be strongly influenced by particle addition. An increase in the pressure is observed to have an equal effect on the basefluid and on the nanofluids, which results in an average pressure-viscosity coefficient for both to be approximately 0.015 mm2/N. The relative increase in the viscosity of the nanofluid to that of the basefluid was not affected by the pressure and was several orders higher than that predicted by the classical effective medium theory.

                    "abstract": "This paper summarizes results of experimental investigation conducted on rheology of oil-based foams. Flow loop experiments were conducted varying base-liquid viscosity (3.4, 8.3, and 12.3 cP), flow rate (1–52 L/min) and foam quality (34–68 percent). High-quality oil-based foams (greater than 68%) were not stable to perform rheology tests. The base-liquids were mixtures of mineral oil, diesel oil, and fluorosurfactant. A flow loop has designed and built to generate and circulate foam fluids to study their rheological behavior. Experiments were conducted at 690 kPa and ambient temperature (26 ± 2 °C). To identify the existence of wall-slip, tests were conducted using different diameter (13.4, 19.6 and 31.8 mm ID) pipe viscometers. Fully transparent PVC pipes were used as viscometers to visualize homogeneity of the foam. Foam degradation during the test was minimized by regenerating the fluid at the maximum flow rate for each flow measurement. Experimental results indicate expected foam viscosity trend that shows substantial viscosity increase with foam quality and base liquid viscosity. The foams displayed non-Newtonian (i.e. shear thinning) behavior, which improves with foam quality. For most field applicable shear rate range (10–1000 1/s), power law model best fits rheology of the foams. Like aqueous foams, consistency index increased with foam quality while fluid behavior index demonstrated moderate reduction. Slight right shifting of flow curve was observed in the small diameter viscometer. Since the shifting was not observed in other pipes, it can be attributed to wall-slip or experimental artifacts that can mimic a similar effect. Applying nonlinear regression analysis, an empirical model is formulated to compute power law parameters (n and K) of the foams. The data from small diameter pipe is not considered in the regression analysis due to the shifting of flow curves. Currently, existing models developed for aqueous and polymer based foams are often used for estimating flow behavior of oil based foams. However, discrepancies of the models can be very high when they are used for unintended applications. Hence, predictions of the new and existing models are rigorously compared. Results indicate that the new model has better accuracy than the existing ones. "

                    "abstract": "Asphaltenes deposition is one of the common problems encountered in the petroleum industry as it clogs the area near the wellbore, builds up in the well tubing, and precipitates inside separators and other surface facilities. Thus, it restricts the flow of the fluids from the formation to the wellbore and to the surface and, hence, leads to production loss. The remedial measures for asphaltenes deposition, however, cost money and time. The aim of the study presented in this paper was to experimentally investigate the role of ultrasonic wave technology as an asphaltenes flocculation inhibitor and to quantify the actual reduction in asphaltenes content of the crude oil when ultrasonic waves were applied. For these purposes, sonication experiments, viscosity measurements, and asphaltenes extraction experiments were performed. Moreover, this study aimed to verify the results and the conclusions that were achieved in a previous similar work by repeating some of the methods they used with different crude oil sample. Conducting this experimental study led to the conclusions that ultrasonic waves have the ability to break down asphaltenes conglomerates and, hence, reduce asphaltenes content in crude oil samples and that there is an optimum time for sonication at which highest asphaltenes particles disintegration is achieved. Moreover, it was concluded that the crude oil viscosity is influenced by its asphaltenes content. "

Cement sheath failure will result in sustained casing pressure, cross flow, lost production, collapsed casing, contaminated water zones and increased workover costs. Today, US federal regulation do not allow wells with sustained annular pressure to be plugged and abandoned. Remediation in these cases is both difficult and expensive. Therefore, utilizing a cement formulation which repairs itself in case of any failure under downhole conditions would be ideal for ensuring long-term well integrity and preventing the occurrence of sustained casing pressure. The objective of this paper is to review the self-sealing cement technology presented in the literature. This study manifests the latest novel laboratory equipment which allowed the cement to cure, get cracked and then seal under downhole conditions. The hydrophilic essence of this material provides a durable cement sheath to help ensure well integrity and zonal isolation for the life of the well. Mechanical properties testing could demonstrat the improved tensile to compressive strength ratio, lower Young's modules and higher Poisson's ratio. In addition, self sealing cement could self seal multiple times and therefore deliver a durable cement sheath in a wide variety of field cases. "

It has desirable properties which make it very suitable for underbalanced drilling (UBD) and other oilfield applications such as cementing, well stimulation and fracturing. Aqueous foams have been in the industry for a long time. As a result, in the past, foam research was more focused on characterization of aqueous foams to optimize their hydraulic and hole cleaning performance (solids carrying capacity). Currently, modern foams such as polymer-based and oil-based foams are becoming more popular due to their superior performance. However, flow behavior of modern foams is complex and not well-understood. The principal objective of this study is to investigate flow behavior of oil-based foams. In order to achieve the study objective, experiments were performed using a recirculating flow loop that has three pipe viscometers. Tests were conducted at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) and elevated pressure (0.67 MPa). Base liquid was prepared by mixing diesel (68%), mineral oil (30%) and surfactant (2%). Nitrogen was used as the gas phase. Foam quality (i.e. gas volume fraction) was varied from 34 to 68%. The effect of foam quality on bubble size was also investigated to provide further insight into the behavior of oil-based foams. Results showed non-Newtonian behavior of oil-based foams which becomes more prominent as foam quality increases. Moreover, like aqueous and polymeric foams, rheology of oil-based foams greatly depends on quality and base-liquid viscosity. Wall-slip effect was observed in the small diameter pipe (13.4 mm). The averaged bubble size of oil-based foams increased with foam quality. "

                    "abstract": "Abundant unconventional resources, producing from deeper horizons and numerous frac jobs in the US were the prime motivations for creating a novel testing procedure for evaluating cement integrity under high pressure, high temperature conditions. Chances of cement sheath failure increase considerably when the application involves deep HPHT wells. Such failures occur as a result of temperature and pressure induced stresses created by well events. A specialized cement HPHT cell was manufactured and mounted on the Chandler 7600, the extreme HPHT Rheometer. This cell has the capability of curing and testing the cement sample in an annular shape at pressures up to 25,000 psi and temperatures up to 450 °F. Consequently after curing, cement samples were tested under cyclical loading in various scenarios at HPHT conditions. These samples failed after certain number of cycles due to reaching their fatigue endurance limit or inconsistent chemistry to withstand the HPHT conditions. This research identifies a matrix for the fatigue failure cycles of 1000 psi, 2000 psi and 5000 psi pressure differentials between the confining pressure and the maximum casing pressure. Three sets of sample were cured at 15000 psi and 330 °F for 15 hours. Then confining pressure was kept constant at 15,000 psi and in three tiers the casings pressure varied from 15000 to 16000, 15000 to 17000 and 15000 to 20000 psi in a cyclical manner for various samples. Results show when the fatigue endurance limit (failure cycle) happens due to pressure change under HPHT conditions. Class H plus 35% silica was used in these experiments and cement failures such as radial cracking, debonding, disking and slicing were observed. "

                    "abstract": "Nanofluids, engineered colloidal suspensions of nano-sized particles (less than 100 nm) dispersed in a basefluid, have shown potential for use as industrial cooling fluids due to their enhanced heat transfer capabilities. Many industrial applications often involve heat transfer fluids at pressures and temperatures above average atmospheric condition. Understanding the rheological characteristics of nanofluids is necessary for implementing them in these extreme conditions. Even though the effect of temperature on the viscosity of nanofluids at atmospheric pressure has been well studied, viscosity measurements of nanofluids at elevated pressures and temperatures have not yet been investigated. This work investigates the rheological characteristics of mineral oil based nanofluids at high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). The nanofluids used in this work were prepared by mechanically dispersing commercially available SiO2 nanoparticles (∼20 nm) in a highly refined paraffinic mineral oil (Therm Z-32, QALCO QATAR), which has wide applications in industrial heat exchangers. Mineral oil and nanofluids, with two volume concentrations of 1% and 2%, are studied in this work. The rheological characteristics of the basefluid and nanofluids are measured using an HPHT viscometer. During experimentation, viscosity values of the nanofluids are measured at pressures of 100 kPa and 42 MPa, with temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 140 °C, and at varying shear rates. The results show that the viscosity values of both nanofluids, as well as the basefluid, increased as the pressure increased. In addition, nanofluids exhibit non-Newtonian characteristics at elevated temperatures and pressures. "

                    "abstract": "This work is concerned with the monitoring of ultrasound effects on inhibition, as well as the reversible kinetics modeling of asphaltene flocculation in toluene-n-alkane systems, which has been rarely reported in the literature. A crude oil sample was exposed to ultrasound waves, and then the colloidal structural evolutions of flocculated asphaltene particles induced by addition of n-alkane were studied, using a confocal microscopy. Observations confirmed that radiation of ultrasound can change the irreversibility of asphaltene flocculation in crude oil. To interpret the kinetics of asphaltene flock aggregation, the Smoluchowski model was used, and the time dependent size distribution of asphaltene flocks was predicted. Fractal analysis was applied and the parameters of the kinetic model were determined. The values for the regressed parameters of the kinetic model show that for sonicated oil, the formation coefficient decreases, while the disintegration coefficient did not considerably change. The reason might be that sonication prevents flocks from aggregating rather than disintegrating them into smaller flocks. It might be the reason for its lingering effect on flocculation. This work illustrates the successful application of the Smoluchowski model for predicting the kinetics of asphaltene flocks under the influence of ultrasonic radiation for the entire range of reversible flocculation processes.

                    "abstract": "Surge and swab pressures have been known to cause formation fracture, lost circulation, and well-control problems. Accurate prediction of these pressures is crucially important in estimating the maximum tripping speeds to keep the wellbore pressure within specified limits of the pore and fracture pressures. It also plays a major role in running casings, particularly with narrow annular clearances. Existing surge/swab models are based on Bingham plastic (BP) and power-law (PL) fluid rheology models. However, in most cases, these models cannot adequately describe the flow behavior of drilling fluids. This paper presents a new steady-state model that can account for fluid and formation compressibility and pipe elasticity. For the closed-ended pipe, the model is cast into a simplified model to predict pressure surge in a more convenient way. The steady-state laminar-flow equation is solved for narrow slot geometry to approximate the flow in a concentric annulus with inner-pipe axial movement considering yield-PL (YPL) fluid. The YPL rheology model is usually preferred because it provides a better description of the flow behavior of most drilling fluids. The analytical solution yields accurate predictions, though not in convenient forms. Thus, a numerical scheme has been developed to obtain the solutions. After conducting an extensive parametric study, regression techniques were applied primarily to develop a simplified model (i.e., dimensionless correlation). The performance of the correlation has been tested by use of field and laboratory measurements. Comparisons of the model predictions with the measurements showed a satisfactory agreement. In most cases, the model makes better predictions in terms of closeness to the measurements because of the application of a more realistic rheology model. The correlation and model are useful for slimhole, deepwater, and extended-reach drilling applications. "

                    "abstract": "The significance of exploring deep and ultra-deep wells is increasing rapidly to meet the increased global demands on oil and gas. Drilling at such depth introduces a wide range of difficult challenges and issues. One of the challenges is the negative impact on the drilling fluids rheological properties when exposed to high pressure high temperature (HPHT) conditions and/or becoming contaminated with salts, which are common in deep drilling or in offshore operations. The drilling engineer must have a good estimate for the values of rheological characteristics of a drilling fluid, such as viscosity, yield point and gel strength, and that is extremely important for a successful drilling operation. In this research work, experiments were conducted on water-based muds with different salinity contents, from ambient conditions up to very elevated pressures and temperatures. In these experiments, water based drilling fluids containing different types of salt (NaCl and KCl) and at different concentrations were tested by a state-of-the-art high pressure high temperature viscometer. In this paper, the effect of different electrolysis (NaCl and KCl) at elevated pressures (up to 35,000 psi) and elevated temperatures (up to 450 ºF) on the viscosity of water based mud has been presented. Introduction High demands on oil and gas and increased depletion rate of near surface reservoirs around the world require industry to look for oil in deeper and more challenging reservoirs. One of the challenges associated with drilling deep and ultra-deep wells is to maintain desirable rheological properties of the drilling fluids. Those properties can be highly influenced and altered by many factors in deep/ultra-deep drilling. Elevated temperature and pressure are among the most significant factors, in addition to ageing and electrolysis contamination. Elevated temperature might be introduced from geothermal source. Hydrostatic pressure, which is a function of depth, increases with drilling depth. Salts can be present in drilling fluids from many sources. It can be contaminated during drilling of salt beds, which the probability to encounter this type of layer during drilling operation is higher for deep wells. It also can be present by design such as adding salt to the drilling fluid system to have a salt saturated water based mud, or in offshore operations where seawater is used in preparing the drilling fluids. The effect of these fluids has been studied in depth for certain ranges of each factor. Bartlett has studied the effect of temperature on the flow properties of drilling fluids for temperature up to 320 ºF. N. J. Alderman et al. studied rheology of WBM under HPHT conditions where temperature reached up to 266 ºF and exceeding pressure of 8700 psi.  Mohammed Ali has studied the effect of three variables, pressure, temperature and aging on the rheology of WBM. S. Rossi et al. has investigated the HPHT rheology of bentonite clay suspensions with different electrolytes such as NaCl, KCl and LiCl. A recent paper by J. Lee et al discussed the rheological properties of invert emulsion drilling fluid under extreme HPHT conditions. Amani et al studied the effect of high pressures and high temperatures on the viscosity of both oil based muds and water based muds. All these studies showed that changes and alterations occurred in the fluid rheological properties when they were subjected to these conditions, and these changes will negatively impact the functionality of drilling fluids. Drilling fluid has an important role during the drilling operations. It serves as medium of carrying the cuttings from the bottom hole to the surface. It provides pressure on the well walls and prevents the walls from collapsing or the formation fluid from entering the wells. Moreover, it acts as a lubricant for the bit and the drilling string. "

                    "abstract": "Gas injection is a common practice in many carbonate oil fields; however, there is a lot of debate around the viability of economical enhanced oil recovery by miscible gas injection. For a correct simulation of miscible gas injection and monitoring the progress of the miscible front in the reservoir, a compositional reservoir simulation is needed. Fluid characterization is one of the most important parts of this simulation. In this paper, fluid characterization for such a mechanism is discussed and a systematic approach is presented which could be used in any other similar study. The dynamic reservoir simulation is also brought at the end for comparison. The carbonate reservoir of the field of interest, contains 900 million barrels of under-saturated, 34 API degrees oil, with initial reservoir pressure of 8200 psi. After building a PVT model and adjusting the Equation of State (EOS), the Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) of four different injection gases (N2, CO2, associated gas and sales gas) were calculated with different methods. Swelling test and slim tube test were also conducted which were used to cross check the EOS tuning. Although, MMPs in all cases were much lower than initial reservoir pressure, their effects on recovery factor were different. A compositional reservoir model was built based on the tuned EOS and the effects of all injection gases in different scenarios were examined. The procedures as well as the main results are explained in this paper. Introduction For the past 60 years, gas injection has been used successfully in both oil and gas-condensate reservoirs. Although, gas injection projects date back to 70s in Iranian oil field, it was only a few years ago where the first miscible gas injection started in the country. Original oil in place of the target reservoir is some 900 million stb which is relatively small compared to giant Iranian oil fields with several tens of billions barrels oil in place. The carbonate reservoir of the field contains under-saturated oil with 34 API degrees and initial reservoir pressure of 8200 psi. Several wells have been drilled in the field and the initial development plan is underway. In theory, recovery factor in miscible injection can be 100 percent in ideal conditions. However, reservoir heterogeneity is a big limitation. On the other hand, minimum miscibility pressure may exceed the fracturing pressure of the reservoir or practically and economically un-achievable. The key factors that impact performance of gas injection projects may be at least reservoir pressure, temperature, fluid composition and reservoir rock characteristics. Therefore, neglecting economical consideration, detailed characterization of the reservoir rock and fluid is the main key to define a proper reservoir development plan with gas injection, which guarantees higher recovery. The feasibility study of gas injection in this field comprised of fluid characterization with the aid of existing conventional PVT test data and conducting swelling and slim tube test followed by dynamic modeling of the reservoir behavior due to injecting different gas into the reservoir. The focus of this paper is on the fluid characterization and feasibility of miscibility condition by injecting four different injection gases. Dynamic reservoir simulation results are also presented for comparison. The injection gases are associated gas, sale gas, pure N2 and pure CO2. "

                    "abstract": "Tremendous amounts of hydrocarbons are located in deeper formations. In deep formations we experience higher pressures and temperatures. Designing a proper drilling fluid that can tolerate such high-pressure, high-temperature (HP/HT) conditions is very challenging. This work is focused on investigating the rheological behavior of water-based drilling fluids with different properties at extremely high pressure and temperature conditions using a state-of-the-art viscometer capable of measuring drilling fluids properties up to 600°F and 40,000 psig. The results of this study show that the viscosity, yield point and gel strength decrease exponentially with increasing temperature until the mud samples fail. This behavior is the result of the thermal degradation of the solid, polymers, and other components of the mud samples. Increase in the distance between molecules due to high temperature will lower the resistance of the fluid to flow and, hence, its viscosity, yield point, and gel strength will reduce. Moreover, conducting this study led to the conclusion that viscosity, yield point, and gel strength increase linearly as the pressure increase. Pressure's effect on these parameters, however, is more apparent at lower temperatures. Ultimately, the study concluded that the mud samples that were used, which are standard industrial types, failed at a temperature of 250oF and that the combined effect of temperature and pressure on mud's rheology is complex.

                    "abstract": "The high-profile blowout at Macondo well in the US Gulf of Mexico, brought the challenges and the risks of drilling into high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) fields increasingly into focus. Technology, HSE, new standards, such as new API procedures, and educating the crew seem to be vital in developing HPHT resources. High-pressure high-temperature fields broadly exist in Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, South East Asia, Africa, China and Middle East. Almost a quarter of HPHT operations worldwide is expected to happen in American continent and the majority of that solely in North America. Oil major companies have identified key challenges in HPHT development and production, and service providers have offered insights regarding current or planned technologies to meet these challenges. Drilling into some shale plays such as Haynesville or deep formations and producing oil and gas at HPHT condition, have been crucially challenging. Therefore, companies are compelled to meet or exceed a vast array of environmental, health and safety standards.  This paper, as a simplified summary of the current status of HPHT global market, clarifies the existing technological gaps in the field of HPHT drilling, cementing and completion. It also contains the necessary knowledge that every engineer or geoscientist might need to know about high pressure high temperature wells. This study, not only reviews the reports from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) and important case studies of HPHT operations around the globe but also compiles the technical solutions to better maneuver in the HPHT market. Finally, the HPHT related priorities of National Energy Technology Laboratories (NETL), operated by the US Department of Energy (DOE), and DeepStar, as a strong mix of large and mid-size operators are investigated.

                    "title": "Fluid Characterization, A Case Study of a field with compositional gradient",
                    "abstract": "Abstract The phenomenon of variation of fluid properties with depth has been observed in reservoirs with large thickness or high dip angle where primarily the gravitational forces along with the thermal effect play an important role on the overall composition of the system. Compositional grading is more evident in high shrinkage oils, volatile oils, rich gas condensates as well as the black oils. Compositional grading is a key issue in dynamic modeling of the reservoir and must be given enough care during both estimation of the stock-tank initially in place and reservoir performance.  This paper presents an engineering evaluation of fluid characterization of a heavy, viscous oil from an Iranian oil reservoir which is considered for a gas injection project. After screening of all available PVT data, the validated data were input into the PVT package and reproduced all existing experiments with only one EOS. Since there was no firm evidence of different equilibrium regions inside the reservoir, it was decided to have one EOS for the whole reservoir with varying mole fraction with increasing depth.  Viscosity is the main property to be predicted with EOS in this task. Mole fractions of C7+ are critical in this case and need special attention. For regressing experimental viscosity, two regions were defined. The results show that the suggested EOS will lead to a reasonable match of all experimental data and when was used in the reservoir simulation in the next phase of the project, the initial oil in place was close to that obtained based on previous black oil model.  Introduction This field was discovered 45 years ago and put on production soon after discovery. The producing formation contains heavy, viscous crude oil with limited amount of dissolved gas. The highest recorded dissolved gas is 140 scf/stb. The oil is highly under-saturated and the bubble point pressure is relatively low, in the range of 600 to 765 psia compared to reservoir pressure of 3500 psia.  The field was developed in two stages and more than 25 wells have been drilled which only limited fluid samples in relatively short interval were taken. From well test, production data and fluid samples, producing formation is interpreted to show variation in fluid properties with depth. Based on the laboratory report conducted on the samples taken from these wells, oil viscosity at bubble point pressure vary from almost 15 cp at the top to more than 450 cp near the oil water contact. Bubble point pressure, Rs, density and plus mole fraction also vary with depth, Figs. 1 through 5.  • Getting into the problem The field oil is heavy, viscous with varying property in different depth. The compositional grading in oil column is not a new topic in petroleum engineering (Ahmed 2007; Whitson and Brule 2000; Hoier and Whitson 2000), however, lack of enough valid PVT data causes some difficulties in data interpretation.  In the literature, compositional grading is more popular in volatile and near critical oil, where, combination of thermal effect and gravity segregation causes composition to vary with depth. Normally, methane mole percent decreases and heavy component increases with depth. Gravity causes gathering of heavy components in the bottom and light component at the top.  On the other hand, temperature causes mainly methane and probably some very light components migrate to the bottom, in the higher temperature part of the reservoir. In the absence of temperature gradient (Iso-thermal condition) usually, a reservoir engineer expects the bubble point pressure decrease with depth. With the temperature gradient in the order of 10-2 F/ft (which is almost the case in most of the oil reservoirs), thermal effect may be neglected. In heavy oil, there is also the possibility of segregation of asphaltene content which is believed to gather and concentrate more towards the oil water contact (Avraham and Hirschberg 1988). "

                    "abstract": "Shale reservoirs have a significant fraction of total pore volume coming from pore sizes in the range of nanometers. Fluid phase behavior in these small pores deviates from the behavior in larger pores (known as bulk PVT). Modifications to thermodynamic modeling coupled with capillary pressure, interfacial tension, and relative permeability are used to analyze the impact of the aforementioned phenomena on hydrocarbon production of liquids-rich shale reservoirs. Furthermore, the impact of rock properties on production performance has to be assessed. Therefore, this paper aims to research the fluid-rock interactions developed within nanoscale reservoirs and their influence on recovery of gas and liquids. We analyzed the phase behavior in nanopores using two approaches: (i) critical properties shift, and (ii) capillary pressure. Reservoir simulation is selected to evaluate these two mechanisms. To attain this goal three cases are constructed, all with constant reservoir porosity, using an in-house compositional simulator: (i) constant permeability reservoir with both bulk and confined fluid properties, (ii) variable permeability reservoir with bulk fluid properties, and (iii) variable permeability reservoir with confined fluid properties. The first case exclusively evaluates the effects of confined vs. bulk fluid properties, the second case only focuses on rock properties changes, whereas the third case studies rock-fluid interactions. For the heterogeneous cases, published pore sizes reported for shale formations are used. Consistency between pore size, porosity and permeability is maintained within the simulation models. Simulation results indicate confinement affects volumetric fluid and transport properties within shales. Significant changes in saturation pressures, which impact relative permeabilities, are manifested with respect to bulk conditions. Comparison of the simulation results allows identification of the contributions of both rock and fluid properties on hydrocarbon recovery. PVT behavior under confinement impacts incremental production during depletion. The methodology introduced in this study is a powerful practical tool for describing rock-fluid interactions in liquids-rich shale reservoirs and helps to understand the shales’ production behavior observed in the field. Detailed comparisons with a gas condensate and a volatile oil reservoir fluids are presented in detail. The physics-based approach implemented in this work provides a novel and important foundation for the analysis of production from confined porous media such as shale reservoirs. Phase behavior in these types of reservoirs is corrected to account for confinement effects in a thermodynamically consistent way to achieve a more accurate performance prediction of nano-porous formations. The modeling developed in this paper is simple, yet robust, as opposed to computationally expensive molecular simulations. The main advantage of the proposed methodologies is that they can be easily implemented into other in-house or commercial simulators. "

                    "abstract": "Laboratory experiments of gas injection in organic rich shales have resulted in significant oil recovery. In Part I (Tovar, Barrufet, and Schechter 2018), we presented an operational philosophy to maximize the recovery factor using a huff and puff injection scheme at the highest possible pressure, regardless of the MMP value. This paper focuses in the impact that fluid transport in organic rich shale has on the recovery mechanisms under gas injection and provides the rationale behind the proposed operational philosophy. We used CT-scanning data from nine coreflooding experiments conducted by injecting CO2 in organic rich shale sidewall cores, two injecting N2, and three further tests of CO2 injection in Berea sandstone thus providing a baseline for comparison to high permeability rock. The core plugs were re-saturated with crude oil in the laboratory, and the experiments were performed at reservoir pressure and temperature using a novel design that replicates gas injection through a hydraulic fracture as closely as possible. CT-scanning was used to visualize the compositional changes with time and space during gas injection. The overall difference in composition between the oil injected and the oil recovered was obtained using gas chromatography. As gas surrounds the oil saturated sample, a peripheral, slow-kinetics vaporizing gas drive is the main production mechanism. Gas injection is performed using a core-holder configuration designed specifically to mimic injection into proppant filled hydraulic fractures, due to lack of injectivity directly into the shale rich matrix. Gas flows preferentially through the proppant due to its high permeability, avoiding the formation and the displacement of a miscible front along the rock matrix to mobilize the oil. Instead, the gas surrounding the reservoir core sample vaporizes the light and intermediate components from the crude oil, making recovery a function of the fraction of oil that can be vaporized into the volume of gas in the fracture at the prevailing thermodynamic conditions. The mass transfer between the injected gas and the crude oil is sufficiently fast to result in significant oil production during the first 24 hours, but slow enough to cause the formation of a compositional gradient within the matrix that exists even six days after injection has started. The peripheral production and the slow kinetic aspects of the recovery mechanism, are a consequence of the low fluid transport capacity associated with the organic rich shale that is saturated with liquid hydrocarbons. The combination of different injection gases and reservoir rocks in our experiments enabled us to effectively isolate the effects of transport properties and phase behavior. In this work, the operational guidelines regarding injection pressure and soak time derived directly from experimental observations are explained in the light of the new production mechanisms using ternary diagrams, thus providing the necessary understanding to successfully conduct gas injection in organic rich, liquid saturated shale reservoirs. Given the vast volume of crude oil trapped in shale reservoirs, this is an important step towards understanding gas injection in Unconventional Liquid Reservoirs (ULR). "

                    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive experimental evaluation of gas injection for EOR in organic rich shale. Experiments in preserved core demonstrated the potential of CO2 to extract the naturally occurring oil in organic rich shale reservoirs, whereas tests in re-saturated core plugs were used to compute accurate recovery factors, and evaluate the effect of soak time, operating pressure, and the relevance of slim-tube MMP on recovery. 18 core-flooding experiments were conducted in sidewall cores from different shale plays. The cores re-saturated with crude oil, were first cleaned by Dean-Stark extraction, and submitted to porosity and compressibility determination. The re-saturation, confirmed by CT-scanning, was attained by aging the core plugs at high pressure for two to four months. In all experiments, glass beads surrounding core samples were used to simulate the proppant and physically recreate in the laboratory a hydraulic fracture connected to the shale matrix. The slim-tube MMP was measured with CO2, and core-flooding experiments were performed below, close to, and above the MMP. The displacement equipment was coupled to a medical CT-scanner that enabled us to track the changes in composition and saturation taking place within the shale cores during the experiments. Continuous CO2 injection and huff-and-puff were evaluated using soak time from zero to 22 hours. Fixed reservoir temperature was used in all the experiments. Recovery factors ranged from 1.7 to 40%. The wide variation was the result of different experimental conditions for pressure and soak time. Both operational parameters were found to significantly affect the recovery. Increasing soak time at constant pressure consistently resulted in significant increase in recovery. The increase varied from 78 to 464% for different pressures and oil composition. Similarly, increasing operating pressure at constant soak time resulted in significant increase in recovery factor from 44 to 338% depending on soak time and oil composition. Unlike the typical response during CO2 EOR in conventional rocks, in organic rich shale, further pressure increases beyond the slim-tube MMP continued to increase the recovery factor significantly. In all runs, almost all oil recovery occurred within three days from the start of the experiment, and in all huff-and-puff tests the highest rate of recovery was observed in the first cycle, implying oil recovery with CO2 is a fast process, in comparison to oil re-saturation of the samples which occurs at a significantly slower rate. This investigation demonstrates CO2 EOR is a technically feasible method to extract significant amounts of crude oil from organic rich shale reservoirs and it provides operational understanding of how to manage pressure and soak time to maximize recovery. The recovery factors obtained in this investigation, in the context of the vast reserves of crude oil contained in organic rich shale, can sustain a second shale revolution and further capitalize oilfield infrastructure.

                    "abstract": "Combustion Assisted Gravity Drainage (CAGD) is a novel in-situ combustion process that utilizes a horizontal injector at the top of the reservoir with a horizontal producer located parallel to and near the bottom of the reservoir. Air is injected, and combustion is initiated with the aid of an electric heater. The heated oil begins to flow downward to the underlying horizontal producer by gravity drainage. The combustion front then develops towards the heel-end of the injector and extends laterally. Direct oil production and short distance traveled by the injected air lead to preserving thermal upgrading and efficient oxygen consumption. This paper presents experimental and numerical simulation studies of the CAGD process. In-situ combustion experiments have been carried out using a rectangular 3D combustion cell with dimensions of 0.62 m, 0.41 m, and 0.15 m. The sand mix consists of 8.2°API Athabasca bitumen, water, and 100 mesh sand and is packed into the cell. Combustion was initiated with air injection, however, to sustain combustion enriched air (50 mol% Oxygen, 50 mol% Nitrogen) was later injected. Experimental and simulation results show that oil displacement occurs mainly by gravity drainage. Vigorous combustion was observed at the early stages near the heel of the injection well, where a peak temperature of 560 °C was recorded. Final bitumen recovery was 72% of OOIP, with produced bitumen being upgraded by more than 2°API. In addition, a thermal simulator (CMG STARS™) was used to history match the laboratory data and to capture the main combustion characteristics and drive mechanisms. Simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data in terms of fluid production rate and recovery, combustion temperature profile and produced the gas composition. "

                    "abstract": "Predicting asphaltene precipitation and its deposition in the porous media is key in understanding costly productivity impairment caused by formation damage. This work presents the development and application of a compositional reservoir simulator including the effects of asphaltene precipitation on production. Precipitation from the liquid mixture occurs as its solubility is reduced either by changes in pressure (natural depletion), or by composition (mixing with another fluid, such as in gas injection). Our approach represents asphaltene as the dense liquid phase computed from a three-phase flash (vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium VLLE) using the Peng Robinson equation of state. The multi-phase and multi-component reservoir simulator developed in this study uses a volume-based formulation, with pressures calculated implicitly and compositions explicitly (IMPESC approach). A cubic equation of state solves a three-phase flash to determine the number of phases co-existing in equilibrium. As asphaltene precipitates and deposits in the rock, the model dynamically calculates new porosities and permeabilities to represent the reduced pore space and effective flow path. We validated our model by matching experimental asphaltene precipitation data while predicting the expected phase behavior envelope and response to key thermodynamic variables (i.e. fluid composition, asphaltene molecular weight and its characterization in terms of pseudo critical properties). Previous modeling techniques were computationally inefficient, exhibit thermodynamic inconsistencies, and/or required special laboratory experiments to characterize the fluid. Our three-phase VLLE flash algorithm coupled with the reservoir model provides superior thermodynamic predictions compared to existing commercial techniques. This model offers the robustness and speed of a flash calculation while maintaining thermodynamic consistency, enabling efficient optimization of reservoir development strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of asphaltene precipitation on productivity.

                    "abstract": "This manuscript incorporates material balance, complex fluid behavior, reservoir characteristics, and well operating constraints into a mechanistic model to forecast production from gas-condensate reservoirs. Our model considers condensate banking, while running at least one order magnitude faster than commercial compositional reservoir simulators. To estimate production from gas-condensate reservoirs we used a thermodynamic cubic equation of state (EOS) to evaluate Constant Volume Depletion (CVD) coupled with radial pseudo-steady state gas flow equations. This allows a relationship between production and time for different production modes (fixed or variable drawdowns, gas rates, or flowing bottomhole pressure), while honoring material balance. As near-wellbore and reservoir pressure drops below saturation pressure, condensate banking occurs in gas-condensate reservoir causing hindrances to flow. Our model considers the reservoir as two concentric tanks. The conventional CVD is modified to begin production at pressures higher than the saturation pressure and to allow two-phase flow. The inner small CVD tank is used to model the near-wellbore saturation using alternative production rules and ‘replenishment’ schemes. The saturation determined from the small tank determines the appropriate relative permeabilities in the flow equation. The forecasts developed from this mechanistic model versus conventional decline curves, constructed from a commercial numerical simulator predicted data, show very promising results and stress the danger of using empirical methods. The value of this model rests in its portability, speed and flexibility, while using rigorous mass balance, complex two-phase flow behavior, and realistic production constraints. This method provides the physical basis for reservoir engineers to predict a more reliable production behavior from gas-condensate reservoirs that can be used to plan depletion strategies and facilities.

                    "abstract": "This work presents the carbon dioxide (CO2) storage capacity of the Wolfcamp formation in West Texas. The potential of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery from unconventional liquid reservoirs have been under investigation in recent years. Quantifying the rock ability to store CO2 is necessary for the economic assessment of CO2 EOR, and for the evaluation of carbon sequestration capacity. We measured the porosity, the rock compressibility and the CO2 sorption in sidewall core plugs taken from two wells drilled in the Wolfcamp shale. Computed tomography scanning technology was used to image the samples and investigate the relation between rock density and porosity, and rock density and CO2 sorption. A gas expansion pycnometer was used for the experiments. To accommodate the challenges associated with extremely tight rocks the equipment was provided with accurate temperature control, and a high resolution gauge with the capability of recording pressure as a function of time. Porosity and compressibility were measured simultaneously using helium. We used different treatments for the rock compressibility and explored its behavior at low pressure. A Langmuir isotherm was used to account for sorption of CO2 on the organic matter of the shale. The volume available for free gas was corrected by incorporating the rock compressibility and the volume of the layer of sorbed CO2 in the analysis of the sorption data. This study adds to the understanding of the storage capacity of the Wolfcamp shale. We found the porosity to be between 5.94 and 10.30%, the Langmuir volume between 38.77 and 154.51 scf/ton, and the Langmuir pressure from 512.59 to 1384.52 psig. Using CT number as a proxy for total organic content, we observed a linear relation between CT number and sorption capacity. Porosity also showed a linear relation with CT number. Free CO2 storage is the main storage mechanism, at pressures above 2500 psig (for all samples) accounting for more than 80 %. Sorption is a relevant storage mechanism at low reservoir pressure. Neglecting the rock compressibility or the volume of the sorbed layer can lead to wrong estimates of sorption capacity. The techniques developed in this work provide for an economic and accurate mean of measuring porosity, compressibility, and sorption in tight unconventional core plugs. The use of a non-destructive approach is necessary to characterize core plugs that must remain intact for further testing such as the evaluation of enhanced recovery techniques in unconventional reservoirs. This research provides relevant data for the economic assessment of CO2 EOR in the Wolfcamp and the potential for carbon sequestration. The linear relations we observed for both, porosity and sorption capacity, with CT numbers, are of extreme interest as they can be exploited for faster petrophysical evaluation of unconventional tight rocks.

                    "abstract": "We propose a robust multiple permeability model to account for pore size variability and filtration effects in shale reservoirs and to explain the behavior of unconventional resources such as anomalous gas oil ratios. Recent developments in technology transformed unconventional low-permeability shales into reliable energy sources. With regard to capacity, unconventional resources are found to be more abundant than conventional ones. These resources have opened new challenges and technical difficulties along with enhanced capacities. Recent advances in high precision analytical tools have revealed that pore size distribution in shale reservoirs cover a wide range. Molecules in pores with different sizes may exhibit significantly different thermodynamic behavior. Rock fluid interactions and space hindrance effects play an important role when pore sizes become close to species' molecular dimeters. This effect can result in a composition difference between pores with large and small diameters in shale reservoirs (sieving effect), with small pores mostly filled with smaller hydrocarbon molecules and large molecules residing in larger pores. To account for such a diverse behavior, this paper proposes a multiple permeability model, which divides shale media into three different permeability/porosity systems: fracture, matrix with large pores and matrix with small pores. We use a modified version of the Peng Robinson equation of state to model the equilibrium hydrocarbon distribution in large and small pores. Our thermodynamics calculations show that as pore dimeter decreases, the concentration of larger hydrocarbon molecules in those pores decreases because of size filtration. A synthetic reservoir model is used along with the multiple permeability model to analyze reservoir production behavior at different conditions. The so-called sieving effect is believed to be responsible for the anomalous production behavior (lower-than-expected or constant gas oil ratios for extended production periods). Our model is then applied to a real Eagle Ford case to history-match production data with the stimulated reservoir volume built upon the fracture microseismic data. The results show that our multiple permeability model provides a powerful tool to evaluate the complicated flow dynamics in liquid shales. "

                    "abstract": "A rigorous method is presented for incorporating confined space into thermodynamic modeling for use in compositional reservoir simulation. Capillary pressure is incorporated as a function of pore size, wettability, and fluid phase properties. Simulated reservoir production is compared for cases with and without including capillary pressure effects due to small pores. During thermodynamic modeling, oil and gas phases are assumed to exist at different pressures, which difference is the capillary pressure. This becomes significant for small pores and is described by the Young-Laplace equation. Including capillary pressure using this method effectively and rigorously couples pore size with the thermodynamic calculations involved in compositional reservoir simulation. The interfacial tension (IFT) required for capillary pressure calculations is determined using the Weinaug and Katz parachor method. These methods are incorporated into an in-house developed compositional reservoir simulator to predict changes in production. Results from modeling show changes in fluid behavior due to confinement. The phase envelope calculated including capillary pressure exhibits a decrease in the cricondenbar and increase in cricondentherm compared to the bulk space phase envelope. Therefore, the bubble point pressure decreases and two-phase flow is reached later in production from an oil reservoir. When the reservoir contains both oil and gas phases, the oil saturation is higher in confined space compared to bulk space. Simulation results show that in a tight oil reservoir, oil production rate including confinement is larger than when assuming no capillary pressure due to this higher liquid saturation. Therefore, produced gas-oil ratio is smaller. Implementation of capillary pressure into compositional reservoir simulation until present has been achieved by use of the Leverett j-function with and without IFT correction. The method proposed here is more rigorous in that capillary pressure is calculated based on pore size and fluid compositions. Thus, as fluid compositions in the reservoir change due to production, capillary pressure successfully reflects those changes. "

Synergistic effects are exploited from heat and mass integration of SAGD and TMD. Specifically, the hot produced water and blowdown water are evaluated for treatment using TMD because of their thermal content and because of the need for high levels of purity which can be achieved by TMD. Several design configurations and scenarios are proposed and evaluated to assess the technical and economic viability of including TMD as a process in water-management systems for SAGD. "

                    "abstract": "This work investigates the use of polymers during CO2 WAG using a physical model. Coreflooding experiments were conducted to compare polymer assisted WAG, conventional WAG, continuous CO2 flooding, and polymer flooding. The effect of miscibility in the CO2 – oil interface was evaluated from coreflooding at two different pressures, above and below the MMP of 1563 psig The MMP was experimentally determined using a fast version of the slim tube procedure with a shorter column. The influence of reservoir heterogeneity was observed by conducting corefloodings in homogeneous and heterogeneous rocks with permeability ranging from 13 to 1300 md. The core plugs were selected using computed tomography to ensure the presence or absence of heterogeneous features. Our results show that under miscible displacement in a homogeneous rock, continuous CO2 injection can reduce residual oil saturation (Sor) to less than 10%, even for a permeability as low as 13 md. The implementation of conventional WAG and polymer assisted WAG in this case was detrimental for the process as water saturation shielded a portion of the oil preventing CO2 contact. The departure from the ideal miscible displacement resulted in a Sor as high as 32 %. For the heterogeneous rock, at 285 psig above MMP, the WAG CO2 was able to reduce Sor to as low as 11%, whereas at 260 psig below MMP a Sor of 23% was reached. As the level of heterogeneity increases, the oil recovery of polymer assisted WAG relative to conventional WAG increased suggesting that a certain degree of heterogeneity is needed for the polymer assisted WAG process to be beneficial. A throughout discussion on the recovery mechanisms and the interactive / combined role of miscibility, heterogeneity, permeability and viscosity is presented. This work adds to the understanding of the CO2 flooding process implemented in the North Burbank Unit (NBU) and the potential to use WAG and polymer assisted WAG to improve mobility control. Sweep efficiency is the most important challenge from a reservoir engineering standpoint for CO2 flooding, but it is particularly critical in the NBU for two reasons. The high vertical heterogeneity in the field, with a permeability variation of three orders of magnitude within 30 ft of reservoir thickness, which greatly exacerbates viscous fingering, and the use of anthropogenic CO2 which makes the economics of the project more sensitive.

                    "abstract": "While previous studies investigate the effect of impure CO2 streams in high and medium API gravity oils, this work focus on reservoirs with low API. This analysis provides additional alternatives for CO2 storage due to the uneconomical exploration and the vast extension of heavy oil resources. CO2 streams (re)injected for storage may contain impurities such as nitrogen, water, and light hydrocarbons, particularly for flue gases and CO2-rich natural. These impurities greatly affect CO2 solubility trapping mechanisms and storage effectiveness. This work investigates the phase behavior of reservoir fluids during injection of CO2 with impurities for storage into two low API gravity oils; 12° (San Ardo heavy oil) to 8.2° (Athabasca extra-heavy bitumen). Numerical studies are conducted using the Peng-Robinson Equation-of-State with Volume-Translation and evaluating Vapor-Liquid and Vapor-Liquid-Liquid equilibria, with rigorously implementation of mutual solubility water-hydrocarbons-CO2. Simulations are conducted at typical reservoir conditions and at high pressure/high temperature synthetic scenarios. The effect of impurity concentration is represented constructing pseudo-ternary diagrams. Results show that C3-CO2 mixtures may achieve miscibility at low pressures. In the presence of N2 and C1 as impurities, miscibility with crude oil was found to be affected negatively. The water presence also affects the solubility. Introduction Carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in oil reservoirs is a well-known carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) alternative to reduce the environmental footprint of CO2 emissions [1, 2]. Though high purity CO2 injection is ideal to maximize storage. The industrial activities (e.g. flue gas and CO2-rich natural gas) or carbon capture plants are usually the sources of impure CO2, containing N2, H2, O2, H2S, water, and light hydrocarbons [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Such impurities present an economic challenge to CCS as current CO2 capturing technologies to achieve high-purity streams are expensive, costing 12-60 US$/tCO2 and accounting for up to two-thirds of the total CCS project cost [2, 7, 8]. Hence, the impure CO2-rich streams may be disregarded for storage and contribute even further to CO2 emissions if vented or flared. An alternative is storing these impure gases in their raw state in uneconomic unconventional oil reservoirs. The low API gravity crude oils account for approximately 70% of the world’s oil reserves [9]. Mature heavy oil fields not subjected to thermal recovery methods could be a good potential for CCS [10].

                    "abstract": "Hydrocarbon production from liquid shale plays presents numerous challenges to modeling and understanding, specifically due to heterogeneity and low permeability. With the aid of the recent advances in high resolution characterization techniques, the current work proposes a partitioning scheme to divide porous media in shale into three different sub-media (porosity systems): inorganic matter and kerogen (in the shale matrix), along with fracture network (natural or hydraulic). A significant advantage of the presented model is its flexibility to incorporate different petrophysical and geological properties to each sub-media. Such capability extends the applicability of our approach to almost all carbon rich mudrocks with different levels of heterogeneity. Various production scenarios were then simulated to evaluate performance of the model. Although a very rich source of hydrocarbon, our results show that relatively high capillary pressure and very low rock permeability hinder oil production in organic-rich shale. Additionally, excessive pressure drop in the near fracture region and localized large gas to oil mobility ratio was observed to impact oil production rate. "

                    "abstract": "Electron beam technology, as a promising energy-efficient process, is used as a new treatment for ultra-heavy asphaltic petroleum fluids. Over the past few decades, heavy oil resources have been recognized to be among the most abundant sources of energy. However, extraction, transportation, and processing problems of these fluids still remain to be a challenge in the petroleum industry. The contribution of these hydrocarbon resources to the energy market has been impacted by the fact that the conventional upgrading and visbreaking methods demand a considerable energy investment. In this paper, we coupled electron beam irradiation with conventional thermal processing methods to find an energy-efficient way of improving unfavorable properties of heavy asphaltic hydrocarbons. Electron irradiation was observed to improve the viscosity reduction process by a factor of 30% compared to thermal treatment. Energy transfer process becomes more efficient in radiation-induced reactions, which results in an intensified cracking process. The role of complex asphaltene structures on radiation thermal cracking was investigated by using hydrocarbons with high and low asphaltene content. Our results showed that in samples with high asphaltene content, electron radiation impacts the reaction mechanism of the thermal cracking process. In fact, high energy electrons interact with aromatic structures of asphaltene molecules, resulting in products with a different hydrocarbon component distribution and time-stability properties, as opposed to the simple thermal cracking case. On the other hand, experiments showed thermal and radiation thermal cracking processes follow a similar reaction mechanism for hydrocarbons of low asphaltene content. "

                    "abstract": "A limited amount of research exists on upward gas-liquid flow in annular spaces. This is a common scenario in drilling operations, especially in underbalanced drilling, and in high production wells. To carry out this study, a 40 meter high laboratory facility with an annulus flow loop composed of a 5–1/2 inch outer pipe and a 2–3/8 inch inner pipe was used, with tap water as the liquid phase and compressed air as the gas phase. This study's objective was to phenomenologically characterize gas-liquid flow in annular space and to investigate possible causes of unexpected periodic formation of liquid slugs in the annulus. The work also assessed potential effects of eccentricity of the inner pipe, extracted empirical relationships between two-phase flow parameters (e.g. pressure drop, holdup, and Reynolds and Weber numbers) for both concentric and eccentric configurations, and tested ramp-up sequences to mimic possible subsequent accumulation of liquid in the annulus. The findings from this study revealed that the total pressure drops in concentric and eccentric cases are similar at high gas superficial velocities; however, trends suggest that an eccentric inner pipe causes higher pressure drops at low gas superficial velocities. This is probably due to observed local liquid accumulations around the couplings of the inner pipe when in eccentric configuration. The presence of couplings affects the stability of the Taylor bubble in seemingly slug flows. No liquid accumulation was seen in any of the ramp-up scenarios tested. In ramp-up tests, pressure gradient spikes at the beginning of each test were found to be strongly dependent on the ramp slope. This work contributes to the understanding of gas-liquid flow phenomena observed in the field, both in wells and in risers, when localized liquid flow reversal and/or accumulation may lead to gas production impairments. This work also sheds some light on how to best operate wells and facilities, and particularly on how to manage production ramp-ups. "

                    "abstract": "A rigorous three-phase asphaltene precipitation model was implemented into a compositional reservoir simulator to represent and estimate the reduction of porosity and permeability responsible for productivity impairment. Previous modeling techniques were computationally inefficient, showed thermodynamic inconsistencies, or required special laboratory experiments to characterize the fluid. The approach developed in this study uses a cubic equation of state to solve for vapor/liquid/liquid equilibrium (VLLE), where asphaltene is the denser liquid phase. Precipitation from the liquid mixture occurs as its solubility is reduced either by changes in pressure (natural depletion) or composition (i.e. mixing resulting from gas injection). The dynamic relationship between phase composition, pressure, and porosity/permeability is modeled with a finite differences reservoir simulator and solved using an implicit-pressure, explicit-saturations and explicit-compositions (IMPESC) direct sequential method. The robustness of this model is validated by the ability to reproduce experimental asphaltene precipitation data while predicting the expected phase behavior envelope and response to key thermodynamic variables (i.e. type of components and composition, pressure and, temperature). The three-phase VLLE flash provides superior thermodynamic predictions compared to existing commercial techniques. This model offers the speed of a flash calculation while maintaining thermodynamic consistency, enabling efficient optimization of reservoir development strategies to mitigate the detrimental effects of asphaltene precipitation on productivity.

                    "abstract": "CO2 flooding often results in poor sweep efficiency due to the high mobility ratio caused by its low viscosity. To mitigate this problem, the alternate injection of water and CO2 slugs, known as the water-alternating-gas process (WAG), is widely applied. Recently, numerical simulation and core flood experiments indicate that the use of chemicals in the water slug may improve mobility control during WAG, thus increasing the ultimate recovery and reducing the requirements for newly purchased or recycled CO2. Therefore, the study of the stability of common polymers used for EOR applications in CO2 saturated environments becomes necessary to address the technical and economic feasibility of this process. In this paper, we report the results of two commonly applied EOR polymers, a co-polymer of acrylamide and acrylate and a co-polymer of acrylamide and ATBS (Acrylamide tert-Butyl Sulfonate). To establish a base line for comparison, parallel experiments were conducted in two different oxygen free environments: one with CO2 and the other with nitrogen. Samples were hydrated and aged at reservoir temperature over 300 days. To isolate the effect of CO2, polymer thermal and chemical degradation were reduced by stripping out dissolved oxygen and decreasing divalent cation concentration from the water prior to polymer hydration. Polymer samples were removed at different times and their viscosity was measured as a function of shear rate and fitted to a power law model. The ability of the polymer solutions to retain their original viscosity over time was used to quantify polymer degradation. The results of this work show that CO2 impacts polymer stability, causing further degradation in both polymers tested. The co-polymer of acrylamide and ATBS exhibited higher resistance to CO2 degradation as it was able to retain 94 % of its original viscosity, compared with the co-polymer of acrylamide and acrylate which only retained 56 %. Factors as chemical degradation, hydrolysis and pH, that also affected the behavior of viscosity over time are addressed. We conclude that commercial polymers can be used during chemically assisted CO2 WAG when low divalent cation water is used at a reservoir temperature of 122 F. "

                    "abstract": "This paper investigates the economic viability of post-production partial upgrading, specifically visbreaking, of heavy oil. We evaluate the potential technical and economic advantages and disadvantages of using visbreaking as a tool for reducing diluent use. Additionally, we identify the cost and energy drivers affecting the economic performance of this partial upgrading operation through a probabilistic Net Present Value (NPV) analysis. We have created a screening tool that can be used for a preliminary evaluation of visbreaking for transportation of heavy-oil solvent systems. Partial upgrading at the wellsite can potentially reduce operational costs to producers and transportation companies. A comparative economic study offered by this test can be used to make decisions on whether to proceed to a more detailed investigation of the process. Importantly, we have created a first-pass standardization tool for the screening of heavy oils for partial upgrading. Visbreaking can prove to be an economically favorable addition or, perhaps, even an alternative to blending heavy oil prior to pipeline transportation. In fact, operational costs of visbreaking are offset by the reduced cost of diluent and capital expenditures that can be mitigated within a reasonable time frame. Finally, we conclude that the altered fluid properties of a visbroken product require less energy per barrel for transportation, which translates to a more attractive economic scenario for transportation for the two baseline cases presented. Introduction Post-production transportation of heavy oil through commercial pipelines requires the oil to conform to certain specifications. The specifications in question depend on the lease agreement between the producer and the transportation company. However, the typical lease agreement includes cutoffs on product viscosity, API gravity, and sulfur content. Generally, the viscosity, gravity, and sulfur content cutoffs for transportation purposes are in the range of 350 cSt, 19o API, and <2 % by weight, respectively (Rahimi 2009). Consequently, the problematic high viscosity and low gravity of heavy oils requires certain post-production operations that make the feedstock conform to transportation guidelines. Most common among these operations are blending with a diluent or upgrading/partial upgrading on site. The World Energy Council (2010) report on heavy oils states that, in Canada alone, about 40% of the heavy oil produced undergoes blending with diluent for transportation; worldwide, this figure is close to 60%. Conversely, post-production upgrading is mainly done on a scale of hundreds of thousands of barrels in Canada, where even the smaller facilities are able to handle over 30,000 B/D. This accounts for a majority of post-production operations in Canada (around 60%), but leaves a sizable percentage of operations, especially operators of facilities, that produce 10,000 B/D or less. The question we are investigating involves replacing diluent operations and/or lowering the diluent usage with small upgrading units at the wellsite. We analyze the economic ramifications of this decision to the producer, as well as along the heavy oil value chain, from wellhead to refinery. Given that there are 6,000 billion bbl of heavy oil in place worldwide (Clark et. al. 2007), there is an enormous potential, now and in the future, for these resources to be a vital part of the energy landscape. However, because of the litany of additional challenges faced in transporting these hydrocarbons to market and converting them into marketable products, the viability of development often depends on the crude oil prices. Table 1 shows some of the additional costs required to make heavy oils into a viable, saleable product. "

Results from this analytical method are in excellent agreement with those from a commercial reservoir simulator. A total of 24 numerical runs were conducted to evaluate scenarios with large pressure and compositional gradients while injecting. The reservoir used was heterogeneous, had a five-spot injection pattern and local grid refinement in the neighborhood of wells. CO2 storage capacity was predicted with an average difference of 1.26 wt% between analytical and numerical methods; average oil, gas, and water saturations at the end of injection were also matched within 2.35% difference.

Historically, oil and gas schools had a focus on local market needs, but more recently, several US and UK institutions have opened campuses in the Middle East, which mirror their original curricula at home. These initiatives were a response to local needs for qualified PEs to international standards. Today, PE programs compete nationally and internationally to recruit top students and deliver top graduates. Inevitably, this makes one wonder whether the oil and gas industry would benefit from a standardized, international PE curriculum. For example, the SPE has already put significant effort into the harmonization of PE studies. The paper sets out what the industry believes it wants from its PE graduates regarding their skills and behaviors. Then, based on the authors' own experience of selected PE curricula from USA and Europe and, by focusing on the Master of Science (MS) level, it compares the relative benefits of having a 1-year or 2-year MS program. It asks whether these programs should produce rounded PE graduates or specialized practitioners in given sub-disciplines.

One of the important features of CAGD is the properly oriented dual horizontal wells, similar to SAGD, which assists in the development of combustion chamber and stable growth of the combustion front in the reservoir. This research evaluates the potential of CAGD as an attractive alternative to conventional in-situ combustion (ISC). A 3D laboratory model was designed and constructed to study the CAGD process. The combustion cell was fitted with 48 thermocouples. A horizontal producer was placed near the base of the model with a horizontal injector in the upper part. The CAGD process combines the advantages of both gravity drainage and the conventional ISC. Experimental results showed the combustion chamber developed in the wide area of the porous media around the horizontal injector. This combustion chamber consisted of flue gases, injected air and hot oil. The gravity drainage is the main mechanism for oil production and extracting the flue gases from reservoir. Recorded temperatures reached up to 650 °C at the combustion front, with oil recovery more than 82% OOIP. Experimental data showed that improper well distance could cause severe plugging in production well perforations and terminate the process prematurely. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the performance evaluation of a novel sensor designed to measure the in situ viscosity of a fluid flowing at downhole conditions. The device provides a mechanism to allow the passage of solid particles (i.e. sand) and has a self-cleaning ability should any build-up of these particles restrict the flowing area. The sensor was assembled in a closed flow loop to prevent measurement error due to partial vaporization of the samples at higher temperatures, and it was tested and calibrated with mixtures of glycerin and water. Differential pressures, flow rates and temperatures were acquired and used to determine the viscosity of two crude oils (and mixtures of those) with viscosities ranging from 0.001 to 0.03 Pa.s (1 to 30 cp ) and temperatures from 37.8 to 71.1 °C (100 to 160 °F). Flow rates were controlled to maintain linearity in the differential pressure response to ensure a laminar flow regime. Viscosity measurements were validated with independent measurements using a Brookfield viscometer and the agreement was within 2%. Using data from this sensor, new viscosity mixing rules were developed to allow determination of mixture compositions from viscosity measurements or mixture viscosities for given compositions. This paper also presents a generalized mathematical model to describe the performance of the sensor with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The model characterizes the response of the sensor as a function of the parameters from a power-law model rheological description and the geometry of the device. The experimental data suggest the validity of this model for predicting the sensor response under realistic operating conditions. The model can be used to calculate optimum dimensions to fabricate a device for customized applications. Potential applications include the estimation of diluent to be added to a more viscous fluid to achieve a target viscosity reduction, fluid identification from wireline formation testers, smart well fluid monitoring, enhanced mud logging, and fracture fluid characterization.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Numerical simulation has been used, as common practice, to estimate the CO2 storage capacity in depleted reservoirs. However, this method is time consuming, expensive, and requires detailed input data. This investigation proposes an analytical method to estimate the ultimate CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs by implementing a volume- constrained thermodynamic equation of state (EOS) given average reservoir pressure and fluid composition.  This method was implemented in an algorithm which allows fast and accurate estimations of final storage, which can be used to select target storage reservoirs and design the injection scheme and surface facilities. Impurities such as nitrogen and carbon monoxide, usually contained in power plant flue gases, are considered in the injection stream and can be handled correctly in the proposed algorithm by using their thermodynamic properties in the EOS.  Results from analytical method presented excellent agreement with those from reservoir simulation. Ultimate CO2 storage capacity was predicted with an average difference of 1.26 wt% between analytical and numerical methods; average oil, gas, and water saturations were also matched. Additionally, the analytical algorithm performed several orders of magnitude faster than numerical simulation, with an average of 5 seconds per run.  Introduction Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been continuously increasing in the past 3 decades. More than 70% of these emissions are composed of CO2, which reached 30 Gt in 2009 (EIA 2011). Several environmental agencies and governments have shown concern about this statistic and its potential relation with global warming.  Coal consumption accounted for the release of nearly 14 Gt of CO2 during 2009, almost 45% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions (EIA 2011). Given that coal is mainly used in power plants to generate electricity, these locations are large sources of CO2 and become the most important target for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) processes. A large coal-fired power plant, generating 500 MW, emits approximately 2.9 Mt-CO2 per year or 55.2 BSCF of CO2 per year.  Metz et al. (2005), Dooley et al. (2006), and EPA (2011) defined carbon capture as a process consisting first of removing the impurities from a CO2-based stream to increase the CO2 concentration and improve the efficiency of the final storage process; and secondly, compressing the gas stream to transport it to a storage location, which can be geologic formations such as aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs, to achieve long-term isolation from the atmosphere.  Geological storage of CO2 in aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs represent an attractive option to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere, as it has been studied in the oil and gas industry for several years. Particularly, interest now exists in using depleted reservoirs taking advantage of the higher storage density in comparison with aquifers; additionally, extensive knowledge of the reservoir's static and dynamic properties, acquired during the developing phase, are available to optimize the efficiency of the project and increase the final storage capacity and profits.

It is commercially proven, delivers high oil rates and high ultimate recoveries. Given the large energy requirement and the volume of emitted greenhouse gases from SAGD process, there is a strong motivation to develop enhanced oil recovery processes with lower energy and emission intensities. Addition of suitable alkane solvents to steam in processes such as ES-SAGD can reduce the use of energy and green-house emissions in SAGD. Potential hydrocarbon additives provide an additional means to raise oil phase mobility beyond that achieved by heat.  The Athabasca reservoir contains small amounts of initial solution gas which is negligible compared to conventional oil reservoirs, however, even small amounts of solution gas might play an important role in thermal processes driven by gravity drainage. In majority of experimental and simulation study of Solvent-Assisted SAGD processes carried out, initial solution gas is not included.  In this study, extensive simulation study is performed to understand the mechanism of solvent addition to SAGD process when initial solution gas is present. Simulation results show that initial solution gas reduces the oil recovery by SAGD process especially in Athabasca reservoir. A varying thickness non-condensable gas layer impedes heat transfer from the condensing steam to the bitumen zone. Hydrocarbon additives are not very effective in the presence of high initial solution gas ratio. Exsolved solution gas causes early condensation of steam and additives. As a result, hydrocarbon additives have diminished opportunities to contact bitumen and are unable to create a high oil phase mobility zone.  In addition, a number of simulations are conducted to understand the role of operating pressure and pressure imbalance between SAGD well pairs. The difference between the operating pressure of adjacent SAGD well-pairs can be used to remove accumulated solution gas from the steam chamber. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This research is a study of the in-situ upgrading of Jobo crude oil using steam, tetralin or decalin, and catalyst (Fe(acac)3) at temperatures of 250 °C, 275 °C and 300 °C for 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours using an autoclave. Viscosity and API gravity changes were investigated. We found that tetralin and decalin alone were good solvents for heavy oil recovery. Tetralin or decalin at concentrations of 9% (weight basis) could reduce the Jobo crude oil viscosity measured at 50 °C by 44% and 39%. Steam alone had some upgrading effects. It could reduce the oil viscosity by 10% after 48 hours of contact at 300°C. Tetralin, decalin or catalyst showed some upgrading effects when used together with steam and caused 5.4%, 4% and 19% viscosity reduction compared with corresponding pre-upgrading mixture after 48 hours of reaction at 300°C. The combination of hydrogen donor tetralin or decalin and catalyst reduced the viscosity of the mixture the most, by 56% and 72% compared with pre-upgrading mixture. It meant that hydrogen donors and catalyst had strong synergetic effects on heavy oil upgrading. We also found that 300 °C was an effective temperature for heavy oil upgrading with obvious viscosity reduction in the presence of steam, hydrogen donors and catalyst. Reaction can be considered to have reached almost equilibrium condition after 48 hours. The study has demonstrated that in-situ heavy oil upgrading has great potential applications in heavy and extra heavy oil recovery.  Introduction As conventional crude oil reserves in the world is being depleted, heavy oil resources have great potential to meet the future demand for petroleum products. Steam injection is the most successful thermal recovery method for heavy oil production. In-Situ upgrading can occur during the high temperature (greater than 300 °C) and high pressure process.  Hyne et al. (1982) researched the details of the chemical reaction between steam, heavy oil and minerals, and described all of these reactions as \"aquathermolysis\". This process is commonly used for the heavy crude oil extraction and transportation. The heat energy that steam passes to the hydrocarbons breaks large molecules into smaller ones, leading to the reduction of viscosity and improvement in flow properties of heavy oils. Hydrocarbons can be broken down at temperatures above 300 °C. The principal mechanism behind this chemical reaction is that the C-S (carbon-sulfur) bond is broken down at high temperature. As a result, the viscosity of heavy crude oil is reduced.  Upon catalytic aquathermolysis, more heavy components of the heavy oil are pyrolyzed and the structures are changed to a larger degree, especially some heteroatom (N, O, and S) containing structures. These changes could hardly be reversed and eventually lead to the reduction of the viscosity of heavy oil (Chen et al., 2008). All the reactions between heavy oil, steam and catalysts were described as \"catalytic aquathermolysis\".  It is believed that at aquathermolysis conditions, hydrogen donors produce hydrogen which takes part in upgrading of heavy crude oils (Ovalles et al., 2003). This would improve the in-situ upgrading process. Many experimental studies have been performed by different research groups to upgrade heavy oil during steam injection by adding different types of hydrogen donors and catalysts. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Using horizontal wells for In-Situ combustion operation brings new advantages. Horizontal wells provide larger contact area between the formation and combustion front. Mobilized oil does not necessarily should pass through cold oil bank to be produced and this improve the overall performance of the process. Combustion Assisted Gravity Drainage (CAGD) is an integrated horizontal well air injection process for in situ recovery and upgrading of heavy oil and tar sands bitumen. Short distance air injection and direct mobilized oil production are main features of this process that lead to stable sweep and high oil recovery. These characteristics identify CAGD process as a highly potential oil recovery method.  This paper summarizes recent experimental and numerical studies of CAGD process. In-Situ combustion experiments have been carried out using a rectangular 3D combustion cell with dimensions of 0.62 m, 0.41 m and 0.15 m. Enriched air (50% O2) has been injected to create and sustain the combustion front in the model. Experimental results showed that oil displacement occurs mainly by gravity drainage. Vigorous combustion was observed at the early stages near the heel of injection well, where peak temperature of about 690 °C was recorded. Moreover, a thermal simulator was used for history matching the laboratory data, while capturing the main mechanisms. Simulation results showed very good agreement between numerical and experimental data in terms of fluid production rate, combustion temperature and produced gas composition.  Introduction Canadian heavy oil resources are located in northern Alberta and western Saskatchewan. This vast resource is estimated to contain more than 170.4 billion barrel of recoverable oil and 315 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil in place which future technology advancement and favorable economic condition enable them to be profitably extracted. Athabasca oil sand production is about 900,000 bbl /day. From this amount, 60% goes to surface mining and rest of 40% is from in-situ recovery techniques such as thermal (27%) and primary production (13%) (A. Burrowes; R. Marsh 2007).One of important challenges for production of bitumen and heavy oil reservoir is the viscosity of the crude oil. This value ranges from a few thousands to millions of centipoise (Gates and Wang 2011) which leaves hydrocarbon immobile at reservoir condition. For recovery of these resources, production mechanism should overcome this issue. One of efficient method for reducing the crude oil viscosity is thermal process. In these types of recovery techniques, heat will be introduced to the heavy oil bearing formation. Heat is generated on the surface (SAGD, CSS) or inside the formation (ISC, THAI). Produced heat increase the temperature of the hydrocarbon in place and drops the oil viscosity. Viscosity reduction should be sufficient to make the crude oil mobile and be producible by production mechanisms (Cunha and Cunha 2005). In-situ combustion has been recognized for many years as a high potential thermal process for recovery of heavy oil and bitumen deposits. This process has been extensively investigated in both laboratory and field scale. Several pilot projects have been tested since 1933. Technically, ISC is gas injection processes which lead to heat wave propagation inside porous media, this heat front and produced gases enhance oil production (Turta et al. 2005; Hascakir et al. 2011). Combustion front sustain by continuous air injection through the reservoir. ISC operation begins with preheating the injection well perforations using downhole heater or chemical reactions (Abuhesa 2009; Li et al. 2005). When desired temperature was recorded, air will injected. In some cases auto ignition was reported specialty when initial reservoir temperature exceeds 180°F (Abuhesa 2009). Despite extensive laboratory investigation and the promises of this technique in challenging environments, there were many failures in field application of this process. These difficulties are generally associated to unfavorable gas gravity segregation, low sweep efficiency and poor directional control of combustion front movement (Bhattacharya and Chattopadhyay 2007; Carcoana 1990; Gates and Sklar 1971).

                    "abstract": "Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is the main commercial technology used for in-situ recovery of Canadian heavy oil and Bitumen. It is commercially proven and delivers high oil rates and high ultimate recoveries. One of the long-term concerns with the SAGD process is high energy intensity and related environmental impacts. Hybrid processes have been developed to take partial advantage of steam and solvent processes while introducing a more efficient and more economically viable recovery methods. Several processes such as Propane-SAGD, Expanding Solvent- SAGD (ES-SAGD), Solvent-Aided Process (SAP), Liquid Addition to Steam to Enhance Recovery (LASER) and Steam- Alternating-Solvent (SAS) were proposed; some of them currently under pilot test. Hybrid steam-solvent processes aim to accelerate oil production rate with lower cost than SAGD and also increase the ultimate oil recovery. Despite remarkable amount of laboratory and computational studies on these processes, there was no extensive critical review of the knowledge obtained for more than a decade. The current level of understanding of the hybrid processes and knowledge around the fundamental physics and mechanisms involved are not fully satisfactory. We believe that a critical review of the status of the hybrid processes will fill the gap by shedding the light on the deficiencies and the limitations of the process, further development areas, and new research topics. Analytical, numerical simulations, laboratory modeling efforts along with pilot test results are summarized. In addition, the main technical challenges of different aspects of hybrid steam-solvent processes are analyzed at different levels. In this paper, special attention is given to a) The effect of reservoir and operational parameters, b) solvent injection strategies, c) The inconsistency between laboratory, simulation and field results and d) problems faced in numerical modeling (capturing the physics of heat and mass transfer). It is believed that a good compilation of the records produced over one decade will constitute a useful reference for the industry and academics. Analytical, simulation, laboratory studies and reported field data strongly support hybrid steamsolvent processes. However, the results are mixed at different level levels and there exists some inconsistencies. The cost of the solvent retained in the reservoir is the major concern and the economics of selected hybrid steam-solvent process for a specific reservoir has to be verified using available tools. The main challenges are verifying effective mixing of the solvent with the in-situ bitumen, managing the solvent placement and distribution in the reservoir, reliably determining the incremental benefit of solvent-addition and ensuring economic solvent recovery.

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper summarizes experimental results of air injection process using dual horizontal well pattern. Experiments were conducted using a three dimensional laboratory model. Canadian heavy oil sample was used to conduct the experiments at 180 psia. The combustion cell was fitted with 48 thermocouples to measure the temperatures in the model and to monitor the combustion front propagation. Laboratory results were analyzed to study the feasibility of combustion assisted gravity drainage (CAGD) process and determine the key parameters. In this technique, horizontal injector was placed at the top Layer of sand pack and used for injection of enriched air. Mobilized oil and flue gases were produced through horizontal production well at the bottom of the cell.  An important feature of CAGD process is the properly oriented dual horizontal wells that assist in development of combustion chamber and stabilized growth of the combustion front in the reservoir. Temperature profile showed that combustion chamber first developed near injection side of the model and then propagated in forward direction during the experiment. Peak temperature of about 530 ºC was recorded. Post experiment sand pack analysis confirmed that coke deposition resulted in formation of gas seal barrier between injector and producer which enhances the circulation of the injected air in the combustion chamber. Ultimate oil recovery estimated about 72% OOIP and thermal upgrading was near 3 ºAPI enhancement in produced oil density.  Introduction In-Situ Combustion (ISC) has been recognized for many years as a potentially effective enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method for recovery of bitumen and heavy oil bearing formations. In this process, air or enriched air is injected into geological formation to oxidize and burn heaviest components of crude oil and generate sufficient heat to mobilize the remaining viscous oil. Lower operational expenses, water consumption and CO2 emission make combustion an attractive process. However, there were also many failures in the application of this process in the field. These failures can be attributed to problems such as gravity segregation, air channeling, unfavorable air to oil ratio and low sweep efficiency.  In respect to other thermal recovery techniques, ISC included more complexity such as; simultaneous heat, mass transfer and chemical reactions in multiphase system, temperature dependent fluid and rock properties. Selfsustained combustion front propagation is necessary for stability of the process and it mostly depends on availability of the oxygen and fuel (coke) at combustion zone; and removing hot oil and flue gases from the reservoir. Any failures to satisfy these requirements can terminate the process. Horizontal well technology brings new prospects for ISC process as it can distribute the air in wider area inside the formation; provide the air in a shorter distance to combustion front and direct production of mobilized oil through bottom horizontal well.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Ionizing electron particles were used as an efficient means of delivering energy to heavy hydrocarbon molecules. Although heavy oil reserves are known as rich sources of energy, their contribution to the energy market has been impacted by the fact that the conventional thermal or catalytic upgrading and visbreaking methods always demand a considerable energy and money investment. Therefore, application of potential alternatives with lower operating costs and higher process throughput appears to be extremely crucial in such a competitive market. In this research, high-energy electron processing technology was offered as a remedy to reduce the viscosity of heavy petroleum samples. Irradiated fluids exhibited lower viscosities than thermally cracked samples. Moreover, reaction temperature was observed to have a substantial influence on radiolysis process. At relatively low temperatures, radiation-induced upgrading stays inactive without any contribution to the viscosity reduction process. However, as the temperature exceeds a specific threshold, radiation-induced chain reactions become activated, decreasing the viscosity of irradiated samples. At the end, we have investigated the effect of different additives upon radiolysis of hydrocarbon molecules. Interestingly, radiolytic reactions were completely suppressed by some of these additives.  Introduction During the last six decades, the indispensable role of petroleum in development and industry has drastically increased its consumption. High demand of petroleum products and inability of conventional reserves to fulfill the growing inquiries brought the attentions, to rather harder to extract and process, unconventional reserves. Nevertheless, the question is whether the industry is capable of increasing the production of unconventional resources to a level that compensates the declined production of depleting conventional reservoirs. Among unconventional reservoirs, bitumen and extra-heavy oil reservoirs form a considerable portion of the resources. Although bitumen and heavy oil are encountered worldwide, large portions of these resources are located in Canada and Venezuela (Pauchon 2004; Stark et al. 2007). However, dealing with such a heavy hydrocarbon demands noticeable investment to extract the fluid out of the ground, transport it to the refinery units, and finally convert it into lighter products (Koppel et al. 2002). While high energy demand of conventional hydrocarbon processing technologies casts doubts on the application of such methods, ionizing incidents, as an emerging processing technology, have been observed to be a promising and efficient way of providing higher selectivity, quality, and quantity of the treated feed (Aksenova et al. 1995). Electron irradiation, as a method of delivering energy to a target molecule, ensures that most of the energy is absorbed by the molecule's electronic structure. This leads to a very efficient generation of reactive species, which are capable of initiating chemical reactions. Zaykin and Zaykina (2004) compared the results of radiation thermal cracking of bituminous samples with methods such as thermal, thermocatalytic, and ozone thermal cracking. Radiation was observed to provide a higher concentration of synthetic oil through a well-controlled process. Electron beam irradiation has also been considered as a way to partially upgrade petroleum samples (Yang et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2009). These authors coupled heat transfer and the radiation Monte Carlo simulation to model the electron beam upgrading process of multi-phase and single-phase hydrocarbons. This work is known as a foregoing study in this field as no previous effort had been done to simulate the electron beam processing of petroleum. Although application of ionizing incidents in the petroleum industry has had a rapid growth during the recent decades, there are limited information resources on the rheological property changes that are brought about because of radiation-induced reactions. Alfi et al. (2012) showed that electron-induced thermal cracking of highly asphaltic petroleum fluids results in samples with lower viscosities than the thermal cracking cases. On top of that, irradiated samples exhibited considerable time-stable characteristics. "

Heavy oil reserves, as one of the most abundant sources of energy, have attracted considerable attention during the last decades. However, high viscosity of such fluids always poses problems during production and transportation operations. Complex hydrocarbon molecules in heavy petroleum fluids can be affordable sources of energy if we can find a way to convert them into components of simpler structure in a cost-efficient process. While high energy demand of conventional thermal and thermo-catalytic process casts doubts on the application of such methods, emerging electron beam upgrading technology appears to provide promising achievements as a novel hydrocarbon treatment process. Radiation thermal cracking was observed to reduce the viscosity of highly asphaltic petroleum samples more than the conventional thermal cracking method. Simulated distillation analysis showed higher concentrations of lighter components in radiolyzed samples, which indicated the intensified cracking as a result of electron irradiation. Stability of the products with time is one of the main concerns because samples with altering properties may cause difficulties after the upgrading process. The viscosity of thermally cracked samples showed a substantial increase with time, while aging investigations on radiation thermal cracking products demonstrated stable properties.  Introduction The dependence of major industries on oil and the fact that petroleum conventional reservoirs are becoming more and more inaccessible as they become depleted directs the attentions toward unconventional—but harder to access—reservoirs. Among these, heavy and extremely heavy oil reservoirs and tar sands form a considerable portion of all petroleum reserves (Stark et al. 2007). While dealing with heavy oil, difficulties arise during the extraction, transportation, and refining stages (Koppel et al. 2002). Ionizing incidents, as a way to refine viscous heavy oil residuals, have been observed to be a promising and efficient way of providing higher selectivity, quality, and quantity of treated feed (Aksenova et al. 1995). During the past four decades, considerable progress has been made on radiation-induced reactions of hydrocarbons. The term 'hydrocarbon enhancement electron beam technology (HEET)' was first used by Mirkin et al. (2003) to generalize new approaches to radiation processing of petroleum products. In addition to higher output of light hydrocarbons, in comparison to thermocatalytic processes, the HEET refinery system was reported to use simple regulation of radiation thermal processing parameters in a limited range of technologically justified values. Yang et al. (2009; 2010) investigated electron beam irradiation as a way to partially upgrade petroleum products. They coupled heat transfer and radiation Monte Carlo simulation to model the electron beam upgrading process of multi-phase and single-phase hydrocarbons. The work is known as a pioneer in this field because no previous effort had been done to simulate electron beam processing of petroleum. As another type of ionizing incident, destructive effects of gamma irradiation on heavy hydrocarbons along with consequent changes in solubility and yield of light fractions were discussed by Skripchenko et al. (1987). Choosing between the different sources of ionizing incidents for different industries depends on several factors such as product specifications, dose requirements, and cost. Products with smaller dimensions can be easily treated using electron particles in a cost-effective process. On the other hand, gamma rays, which have higher process cost, are used for the cases of bulky object treatments (such as shipping cartons full of medical devices or food products) (Cleland 1983). "

The addition of suitable hydrocarbon solvents to steam has long been regarded as the simplest and most effective method to increase SAGD performance. Higher oil recovery, accelerated oil production rate, reduced steam to oil ratio and generally more favorable economics is expected from the addition of potential hydrocarbon additives to steam.  This paper summarizes experimental results of addition of potential solvents to steam in SAGD process. N-Hexane and nheptane were co-injected with the steam and the experimental results were compared with pure steam injection. In addition, pure heated n-hexane was injected in one experiment to assess the performance of solvent-based processes. Experiments were conducted using a scaled two-dimensional physical model. Peace River Bitumen samples were used to conduct the experiments at 80 psia.  Experimental results were analyzed to determine the key variables involved in Solvent Assisted SAGD (SA-SAGD) processes. Solvent choice is not solely dependent on mobility improvement capability but also reservoir properties and operational conditions. Co-injection of suitable solvents with the steam led to accelerated oil production rate, higher oil recovery and lower energy to oil ratio. Solvent requirement for pure heated n-hexane injection was considerably high. The vaporized solvent chamber expansion was slow due to low heat content of the solvent and heat losses.

Based on the enthusiastic students' feedback, it is clear that they enjoy tele-teaching and learn from it even more than they do from conventional courses. This paper is a follow-up to the papers SPE 134440 and 124748, which were well received by the audience who suggested further investigation into these techniques.  Introduction Moore and Kearsley (2005) have defined distance education as \"all planned learning that normally occurs in a different place from teaching, requiring special techniques of course design and instruction, communication through various technologies, and special organizational and administrative arrangements??. The concept of distance learning includes the traditional elements of education: the learner, the instructor, the content, and the means of communication, traditionally textual material, graphic illustration, discussion, and an understanding of how learning takes place, as well as two additional elements: the technology used to deliver the learning environment, recognition and acceptance of the fact that the teaching and learning may occur at locations distant from each other and often at different times.  Michael Moore's theory of transactional distance (2007) defines the context well: the transaction of distance education takes place over the dimensions of time and space. Thus, the theory of \"transactional distance?? requires the acknowledgement that learning and teaching characteristics differ from those of the traditional classroom. The learner is more autonomous being separated from the teacher, and the teacher is more aware of the importance of communication and exchange by providing structure for course content presentation as well as providing for dialogue, making special efforts to interact with the student and to provide the student with various opportunities for different types of interaction within the context of the course. Such actions help to reduce the potential psychological and communicational gap, thereby reducing the transactional distance inherent in the context of distance learning. "

                    "title": "Experimental Study of Air Injection in SAGD Chamber",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is a successful method for recovering bitumen and heavy oil that is widely used in Alberta, Canada. However as the SAGD chamber fully develops (mature chamber), the oil production rate starts to decline and the steam oil ratio (SOR) to increase, directly affecting the economic viability of the process at this stage. Air injection after SAGD is one potential option to recover residual oil inside mature SAGD chambers, and to avoid having steam migration form adjacent SAGD patterns.  In this paper, a detailed laboratory experiment is presented in order to analyze the feasibility of in-situ combustion after an SAGD process. A 3D laboratory model was designed and constructed. The combustion cell was fitted with 48 thermocouples. A horizontal pair well is placed at the bottom of the model with interwell spacing of 3 cm. The SAGD chamber occupies 26% of the model. The first 15 cm of the injection well is preheated using an electric igniter. Enriched air is used for establishing the combustion chamber. After ignition, the combustion front develops near the injection side and progresses forward while laterally limited inside SAGD chamber boundaries. Flue gases and hot oil are produced through the bottom horizontal well. A maximum temperature of 617ºC was recorded, with cumulative oil recovery of 12% original oil in place (OOIP). Post experiment analysis of the sand pack shows that, besides sweeping the residual oil in the SAGD chamber, the combustion process created a hard coke shell around the chamber, which isolated the steam chamber from the surrounding media.  Introduction SAGD is known as an enhanced oil recovery method for the recovery of bitumen and heavy crude oil. In this technique two horizontal wells with vertical distances of about 5-7 meters are drilled into the oil-bearing formation. Steam is injected through an upper horizontal well. Delivered heat from the steam mobilizes the heavy crude oil which drains directly to the bottom horizontal production well and then is pumped to the surface. Gravity differences between the steam and the crude oil cause the steam to rise and develop a steam chamber in the formation in both horizontal and vertical directions. SAGD is a stable process and its recovery can increase up to 60% to 70% OOIP, even in a heterogeneous formation. Currently, most SAGD projects are operated in Canadian oil sand, which has the biggest bitumen deposit in the world.  SAGD chambers may develop in different directions: vertical direction, in contact with overburden and underburden formations, will increase heat losses; or horizontal direction can merge with the adjacent steam chamber and lead to leakage of steam and the decrease of effective drainage height. These factors will affect the economic viability of the process in later time and increase the cost of operation. Development of the technology is currently focusing on energy efficiency improvement by lowering the SOR in the SAGD process. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is the preferred in-situ technology to recover heavy oil and bitumen from Canadian reservoirs. It is commercially proven, delivers high oil rates and high ultimate recoveries. Given the large energy requirement and the volume of emitted greenhouse gases from SAGD process, there is a strong motivation to develop enhanced oil recovery processes with lower energy and emission intensities. Addition of potential alkane solvents to steam in processes such as ES-SAGD can reduce the high use of energy and green-house emissions in SAGD. Potential hydrocarbon additives provide an additional means to raise oil phase mobility beyond that achieved by heat.  Numerous simulation studies are published on the effect of hydrocarbon additives on SAGD process but few experimental results exist in public domain. Often, Conflicting results exist both in simulation studies and even field tests. In addition, numerical simulations are unable to fully capture the mechanism of hybrid steam solvent processes.  This paper summarizes experimental results of addition of potential solvents to steam in SAGD process. N-hexane was selected as the preferred additive to be co-injected with the steam and the experimental result are compared with pure steam injection process. Experiments were conducted using a scaled two dimensional cylindrical model. Peace River Bitumen samples were used to conduct the experiments at 80 psia.  Experimental results were analyzed to determine the key parameters involved in solvent assisted SAGD processes. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of hydrocarbon additives to enhance SAGD process. Co-injection of potential solvents led to accelerated oil production rate, higher oil recovery and lower energy to oil ratio.  Introduction The combination of steam and solvent in gravity drainage processes has been a subject of discussion of many experimental and simulation papers after successful field tests of steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process.  Although SAGD process appears to be the most promising in-situ recovery for Heavy oil and Bitumen recovery, it suffers from high energy intensity and environmental impacts. The aim of hybrid steam solvent processes is to take advantage of viscosity reduction capability of both heat and solvent and reduce the energy intensity of SAGD process (Nasr et al. 2003). Higher oil production, lower Steam to Oil ratio (SOR), increased well productivity and increased ultimate oil recovery has been expected from addition of the solvent to steam.  The challenges for addition of solvents to steam are the solvent type, solvent concentration, injection strategy and operating pressure (Govind et al. 2008). Most of published experimental results regarding the addition of solvent to steam in SAGD have been carried out in Alberta research Council. They have investigated the addition of different type of solvents to steam to increase the performance of SAGD process. Nasr et al. (2002) patented ES-SAGD process and believed that the most suitable solvents are the ones in which have the closest thermophysical properties to the water at temperature and pressure conditions in the steam chamber. They concluded that Hexanes or diluents which contain mostly higher carbon numbers than 6 are the most preferred hydrocarbon additives. "

                    "abstract": "Among the three types of geological CO2 sequestration (mature oil and gas fields, unminable coalbeds and deep saline formations), depleted gas condensate reservoirs are particularly interesting. First, because of the high-compressibility of gas, these reservoirs have larger storage capacity than oil reservoirs or aquifers. Second, the condensate that has dropped out from the gas phase during natural depletion will re-vaporize because of re-pressurization of the reservoir and by miscibility with the injected CO2. This condensate can be recovered from producing wells and leaves more pore volume for available storage of CO2. The objective of this study is to investigate the CO2 storage capacity in different formation types, for different levels of CO2 purity and different injection schedules. To this aim, we analyzed the injection of a CO2-based stream into a depleted gas condensate reservoir and into a saline aquifer using a compositional reservoir simulation model. The dynamics of the reservoir impose a minimum period of injection that is required in order for the storage scheme to benefit from 100% of the reservoir storage capacity. Hence, over and above a certain CO2 injection rate, it becomes meaningless to invest in bigger compressors to increase this rate to reduce the time of injection. When the CO2 stream contains impurities, such as N2 or methane, the storage capacity of the reservoir decreases proportionally to the impure stream's compressibility factor and its concentration of impurities. This finding suggests that an economic optimum between the costs of separation, compression and injection can be determined. Finally, the mass of CO2 sequestrated per pore volume in the equivalent aquifer model is approximately 13 times lower that of the depleted gas condensate reservoir model. This confirms that, because of their low overall compressibility, aquifers offer a far lower ratio of CO2 stored per pore volume than depleted gas condensate reservoirs. However, aquifers tend to have a far larger extent, which often compensates somewhat for this lower ratio and therefore provides storage for significant volumes of CO2. "

Disposal of produced water from oil and gas wells is a costly procedure for production companies, but water to oil production ratios exceed 10:1 (by volume) at many wellsites. Much of the petroleum produced in the United States and elsewhere is found in arid regions that could benefit greatly if the produced water could be purified sufficiently for agricultural, industrial, or potable use. Our previous research identified and validated treatment options capable of recovering a high proportion of fresh water from oilfield brine. In this paper, we extend the earlier research further by examining the possibility of using renewable energy to power the units in \"off-the-power-grid\" situations. A macro driven spreadsheet was created to allow for quick and easy cost comparisons of renewable energy sources for a variety of scenarios. Using this tool, wind and solar costs were compared for cities in regions throughout Texas. The renewable energy resource showing the greatest potential was wind power, with the analysis showing that in windy regions such as the Texas Panhandle, wind generated-power costs are lower than those associated with diesel-fuel generation.

One of the long-term concerns with the SAGD process is high energy intensity and related environmental impacts. Addition of potential alkane solvents to steam in processes such as ES-SAGD can reduce the high use of energy and green-house emissions in SAGD. However, the principal challenge is the high cost of the solvents. As a result, the economic viability of solvent assisted processes highly depends on the original reservoir and fluid properties and the operating strategy used to co-inject the solvents.  The main objective of this study is to compare the simulation results of addition of potential solvents to steam in two different types of reservoirs, cold lake and Athabasca. Propane, Butane, Pentane, Hexanes and Heptanes with different proportions from 1%-20% by weight have been co-injected with the steam. The simulations carried out in absence and presence of initial solution gas to find out the effect of solution gas on performance of SAGD and solvent assisted SAGD processes.  Simulation results show that initial solution gas reduces the oil recovery especially in Athabasca reservoir. A varying thickness non-condensable gas layer impedes heat transfer from the condensing steam to bitumen zone. Hydrocarbon additives create a high oil phase mobility zone resulting in production acceleration. Solvents heavier than butane are considered suitable candidates for Athabasca type and butane gave better results in Cold Lake type reservoir under operating conditions of this study. In addition, a detailed study is carried out on the properties of different phases such as phase mobility, saturation and viscosity at the steamsolvent- oil interface to have a better understanding of the effect of presence hydrocarbon additives in the steam chamber.

                    "abstract": "Over the past decade, gas hydrates have stimulated significant interest and triggered fundamental research. Primarily, the focus has been on hydrate blockage in pipelines, and on naturally occurring gas hydrates. However, gas hydrates can be useful in many different ways that can be pertinent to our industry, thanks to their unique structural packing where only certain molecules can enter the gas hydrate cavities. Among the several potential uses of gas hydrate technology are gas separation, transportation and storage of natural gas, desalination, and carbon dioxide disposal. In particular, it is possible to (i) separate the heavier components (pentane and higher) from natural gas, and (ii) capture, store and transport natural gas. This paper proposes a workflow for capturing, storing and transporting gas in the hydrate form, particularly for situations where there are infrastructural constraints such as lack of pipelines. These applications of gas hydrate technology can have potential benefits to the oil and gas industry. Introduction The need for new methods for gas transportation is the challenge that drives the development of hydrate technology for storing and transporting natural gas (Masoudi, et al, 2005). The ability of natural gas to form hydrate in combination with water is a very interesting and useful concept (Makagon, 1997) and can be widely utilized in the industry. An important feature of hydrates is their high storage capacity. 180 volume units of gas at standard conditions can potentially be packed into 1 volume unit gas hydrate crystals. Gas hydrates can be regarded as a safe and easy way of capturing gas, storing and transporting associated, stranded and flared gas (Berner et al, 2003). The objective of this work is to propose useful industrial applications that rely on gas hydrate technology, based on selected gas samples (Table1). These applications include situations when: (1) Gas storage is required, and so natural gas is converted to gas hydrate and stored for future use. (2) Natural gas hydrate technology provides an attractive method to capture and transport natural gas on a small scale. (3) In the hydrate process of capturing natural gas, heavy components (C5 and above) are separated out as Natural Gas Liquids (NGL), while C1 to C4 are stored in hydrate form. The proposed workflow will be discussed using two representative gas samples (‘Dry gas' and ‘Sample 2'). The former is basically pure methane, whereas sample 2 has the heavier C5 and C6 components. It is assumed that these gases are produced from a given field, at a given rate. In this study, the PVTSim program (Calsep, 2008) was used for the evaluation of hydrate formation and expansion processes. Expansion of the gas from wellhead conditions is necessary to trigger hydrate formation, depending on the properties of the gas, as it will be shown in this analysis with the two selected samples. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The ability to measure the true viscosity of formation fluids at downhole conditions is highly desirable in reservoir fluid characterization. A novel downhole viscosity sensor that can provide the real-time measurement of the viscosity of a flowing fluid at downhole conditions is discussed in this paper. The measurement can be obtained during open hole sampling of reservoir fluids, or during fluid profiling to characterize the reservoir properties at a vertical resolution much higher than that of traditional sampling methods. This leads to reservoir better understanding of the reservoir, leading to better decision-making with regards to field modeling, facilities planning and production optimization.  A prototype of a downhole sensor was previously calibrated and tested with fluids of 1-28 cP viscosity, under a temperature range of 100o to 160oF. The sensor's viscosity readings were validated against independent measurements taken with a Brookfield viscometer. Following on from that work, this paper presents a generalized mathematical model to describe the performance of the sensor with Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids. The model characterizes the response of the sensor as a function of the parameters from a power-law model rheological description and the geometry of the device. The previously gathered experimental data suggest the validity of this model for predicting the sensor response under realistic operating conditions. The model can be used to calculate optimum dimensions to fabricate a device for customized applications.  Introduction Measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools are used to capture key downhole reservoir information while drilling wells (Maglione et al., 2000; Kalotay, 1994; Dealy, 1990; Zimmer et al., 2001). However, fluid viscosity measurements, which are based mainly on the analysis of fluid samples collected at surface, can result in a rheological characterization that does not adequately represent the nature of the fluid at downhole conditions and so lead to erroneous predictions of reservoir behavior. Clearly, a direct measurement of fluid viscosity is the preferred method, but the determination of the viscosity of a reservoir fluid at downhole conditions still remains a complex task due to the difficulty of designing a tool capable of measuring accurate rheological information in a harsh operational environment (Kalotay, 1994; Maglione et al., 1996).  Previous work (Rondon et al., 2010; Rondon, 2008) validated the capabilities of a prototype device that could be used as a downhole sensor to measure viscosity. This paper focuses on the development of a fundamental model of the sensor response, such that it would be possible to accurately predict pressure drop along the length of the device for a measured flow rate, or the flow rate corresponding to a measured pressure drop. These measurements, coupled with the geometry of the device, could be used to characterize the tool response to Newtonian and Non-Newtonian (power law) fluids. A more significant application would be the use of this model as a design tool to build devices with different geometry, fine-tuned to specific applications.  Viscosity sensor description The physical principle of the device is the measurement of the differential pressure over a region where the flow regime is laminar. The method for determining the viscosity of a reservoir fluid consists of flowing a stream of the fluid, at its actual in situ conditions, through the device and measuring the pressure differential between inlet and outlet.

This paper is a following up of our previous paper that was presented at the ATCE 2009 and enjoyed a tremendous interest of the audience, and gives answers to some of their questions.  Introduction Interest in online or distance education has grown rapidly in recent times due to several factors. The world economic situation is challenging; adult learners in many cases are employed in secure and well paying job positions and are not interested in returning to the role of the traditional student at a college or university campus or cannot afford to do so; and prospective students/learners are in locations away from a university or college that offers the needed coursework. Distance education offers the capability of access to learning based on the needs of the learner at her or his point of need. The purpose of this study is to examine the advantages and limitations of using web-based tele-teaching technique to deliver course content to students at the graduate level in petroleum engineering with special focus on interaction in a distance learning environment. We define the theoretical basis for distance education. We describe the real-time distance learning course that is the basis for this study. Then, we discuss the importance of interaction in distance learning environments to include learner-teacher interaction, learner-learner interaction, learner-content interaction, and learner-interface interaction. Finally, we describe the affordances and constraints that we found and implications for future distance education petroleum engineering courses.

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of harnessing geothermal energy from heavy oil fields that have undergone steam-flooding and so accumulated substantial heat from steam injection. Once the steam-flooding process reaches economic cut-off, due to high water cut and/or high steam-to-oil ratio, the reservoir would be abandoned, leaving behind stored energy in the form of heat. From this point, the reservoir could be regarded as an artificial geothermal system, and its intrinsic heat recovered by water circulation. A compositional, thermal simulator was used to model the overall heat transfer efficiency throughout the reservoir. The Fourth SPE Comparative Solution Project (problem 3) - complemented by parameters obtained from well-known analogue fields - was adopted to build the base case scenario. Sensitivity analyses were then performed to identify critical parameters that may affect the potential for harnessing the geothermal energy. The reservoir simulations were then coupled with semi-analytical computational of the heat exchange between wellbore and surrounding formation to estimate the total surface heat recovery. The latter could be used for either direct heating or electricity generation, depending on the arrival fluid temperature. State-of-art technology for converting heat from low-enthalpy resources (\"waste energy??) into electricity were evaluated, together with an estimate of the parasitic load associated with ancillary facilities necessary to run operations beyond the oil-recovery phase. This study shows that it could be possible to advantageously extend the life of heavy oil fields by means of a heat-recovery phase after the oil-recovery phase. Introduction Unconventional heavy-oil resources have become increasingly attractive to the industry because of global increase in energy demand and decline in conventional oil production. These resources, which once were deferred from production because of the inherent additional costs for enhancing recovery, are revisited when the oil price is higher.  Production from heavy oil reservoirs can be improved by reducing the oil viscosity (thermal processes). Some examples of thermal methods are steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), in-situ combustion, and cyclic steam stimulation (CSS). The most effective methods are steamflooding and hot waterflooding, with recovery factors additionally increased 20 to 30% by these two techniques. Heavy oil reservoirs where steamflood or hot waterflood processes have been applied for a long period of time reach economic cutoffs resulting from high water cut, high steam-to-oil ratio (SOR), or steam breakthrough. Reservoirs are then either produced until depleted or abandoned. Thanks to the thermal properties of reservoir rock, great amount of heat is accumulated within it during thermal processes. However, concurrent heat dissipation to overburden and underburden takes place during the production period and also after abandoning the fields. The heat trapped during thermal processes could be exploited as geothermal energy potential. "

The device provides a mechanism to allow the passage of solid particles (i.e. sand) and has a self-cleaning ability should any build-up of these particles restrict the flowing area. The sensor was assembled in a closed flow loop to prevent measurement error due to partial vaporization of the samples at higher temperatures where it was tested and calibrated with mixtures of glycerin and water. Differential pressures, flow rates and temperatures were gathered and used to determine the viscosity of two crude oils with viscosities ranging from 1 to 30 cp and temperatures from 100 to 160 °F. Flow rates were controlled to maintain linearity in the differential pressure response to ensure a laminar flow regime. Viscosity measurements were validated with independent measurements using a Brookfield viscometer and the agreement was within 2%. Using data from this sensor, new viscosity mixing rules were developed to allow determination of mixture compositions from viscosity measurements or mixture viscosities for given compositions. Potential applications include the estimation of diluent to be added to a more viscous fluid to achieve a target viscosity reduction, fluid identification from wireline formation testers, smart well fluid monitoring, enhanced mud logging, and fracture fluid characterization.  Introduction The main objective of measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools, which are used to record downhole information during the drilling of wells, is to capture information about the rock formation and the physical condition of the wellbore. Fluid viscosity of flow streams is essential for the design and operation of production facilities, drilling operations and reservoir engineering calculations. Viscosity of gas-free or dead oil is easily measured on a collected sample, yet to measure the viscosity of a gas-saturated oil sample at elevated pressure and temperature is more complicated and the published viscosity correlations are unreliable. Clearly, a direct measurement of fluid viscosity is the preferred method, but the determination of the viscosity of a reservoir fluid at downhole conditions still remains a complex task due to the difficulty of designing a tool capable of measuring accurate rheological information in a harsh operational environment (Kalotay, 1994; Maglione et al., 1996). A down-hole in situ viscosity sensor could serve two main purposes: firstly to permit estimates of permeability from wireline formation testers as both mobility and the corresponding fluid viscosity are known, and secondly to allow qualitative monitoring and measurement of the level of drilling mud filtrate contamination.

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the experimental and simulation study of E-Beam hydrocarbon upgrading process which shows the efficiency of E-Beam process and radiation energy transfer mechanism for single and multiphase fluid. Society's growing demands for energy results in rapid increase in oil consumption and motivates conversion of unconventional resources to conventional resources. There are enormous amounts of heavy oil reserves in the world but the lack of cost effective technologies either for extraction, transportation, or refinery upgrading hinders the development of heavy oil reserves. The traditional problem of conventional heavy oil upgrading is that it takes large amounts of thermal energy and expensive chemicals or catalysts to upgrade. Using E-Beam technology we may lower the energy requirement and reduce the use of specific chemicals or catalysts.  The design of facilities can be simpler and will contribute to lowering the costs of transportation and processing of heavy oil and bitumen.  Introduction The global energy trend forecasts point to an increasing demand of fossil fuel over the next decades. However, the crude oil share in the total primary energy supply will remain around 35% until 2030 (Saniere et al. 2007). Thus, the remaining 65% of the energy supply must come from other non-conventional resources such as tar sands, extra-heavy oil, and oil shale.  Making those unconventional oil reserves profitable requires an increased focus on technology that make the exploitation of heavy crude oil economically viable. To accomplish this, we must develop cost-effective ways to upgrade the heavy oil by removing sulfur, water, salts, and other impurities, decrease its density, and/or reduce its viscosity (Agrell et al. 2007).  One of the critical problem in upgrading of hydrocarbons is the cracking (breaking up the molecules) process, which requires substantial amount of energy to upgrade. E-beam upgrading of hydrocarbons which uses unique features of electron beam irradiation in order to lower the thermal energy of conventional upgrading process can be a promising cost effective solution for the problem. However, detailed investigations of the process mechanisms should be done to utilize the technology.  Many laboratories all over the world have conducted research on the radiation chemistry of hydrocarbons since the mid-1920s.  In 1965, Salvoy and Falconer used a VDG E-Beam generator and a gamma ray machine to show that the effects of irradiation of nhexadecane (n-C16) are apparently independent of source and dose rate. Wu et al. (1997) conducted n-C16 radiation thermal cracking (RTC) with gamma rays and found that radiation enhances the cracking process. Recent research of polymer cracking with E-Beam (Miao et al. 2009) found that irradiating polymer causes main chain scission at doses below 200 kGy.  By using a viscous, high paraffin, high sulfur content crude oil under a very high dose rate (1~4 kGy/s) for a RTC experiment, Zaykina et al.

In addition, Zaykina's group (2004c) conducted RTC of bitumen and observed an increase in isoparaffins and light oil yield with a slight reduction of aromatic components. The greatest problem during thermal cracking arises from reactions involving aromatic feed since aromatic compounds in the feed have a very high tendency to undergo polycondensation reactions that results in coke formation (Simanzhenkov, 2003).

                    "title": "Ensemble Based Optimization of EOR Processes",
                    "abstract": "Abstract The advent of smart well technology has allowed the control of a hydrocarbon field in all stages of production. This holds great promise in managing EOR processes, especially in terms of applying optimization techniques. However, some procedures for optimizing EOR processes are not based on the physics of the process, which can lead to erroneous results. Additionally, optimization of EOR processes can be difficult if there is no access to the simulator code for computation of the adjoints used for optimization. This work is a general procedure for designing an initial starting point for a surfactant flood and water flood optimization. The method does not rely on a simulator's adjoint computation. Instead of using adjoints for optimization, the Ensemble Kalman Filter optimization (Enkfopt) was developed and used to optimize the net present value (NPV) of a 5 spot surfactant flood and water flood process. Additionally, constrained optimization was created and added to the Enkfopt method. The controls were based on surfactant flood and water flood process dynamics and included production control for four producers, injector injection rate, and surfactant concentration. Field permeability, field porosity, and economic inputs were parameters held constant for the optimization. Once the optimal solution was obtained, multiple realizations of the permeability and economic inputs were used to generate a cumulative probability distribution of the NPV. Preliminary results show an improvement of the NPV of the water flood process (up to 60% increase) and surfactant flood process (up to 150% increase). Results also show that the optimized controls retain the same relationship as the original controls. This work provides a method to manage risk by performing an optimization and then using the optimal solution to assimilate possible geological and economic scenarios. Cumulative distribution curves of NPV provide tools in accessing the probability of project success.  Introduction Economic and geological uncertainty play a critical role in deciding the producing life of an oil field. Although there may still be producible oil in a field, economics of water handling and geological uncertainty of permeability fields and to a lesser extent porosity fields make producing the remaining oil economically very arduous. Currently, early water breakthroughs (which exacerbate the economics) limit oil recovery for carbonate reservoirs to less than 10% or 25%, while for sandstone reservoirs it ranges from 10% to 35% (Sun, 2009). Typically, after primary production a waterflood is employed for pressure support and to further sweep any oil that is left over; thus decreasing the field oil saturation. One potential drawback, though, for the waterflood is the inability to accurately sweep the oil due to an inadequate mobility ratio. Because of this drawback, it is important to investigate an alternative to a waterflood that does not rely on the mobility ratio alone to effectively displace any oil. One example of such is the surfactant flood. Surfactant floods differ from water floods in that surfactant floods rely on reducing the interfacial tension between the displacing fluid and displaced fluid (Barrufet, 2008).  A variant of the Ensemble Kalman filter (Enkf) was used as the optimization method in this paper. This optimization approach is not a direct corollary to Enkf because it does not match a set of observations, but rather uses Enkf to calculate the gradient needed for optimization. Approaches similar to the one presented in this paper have been investigated by various authors who sought to optimize a waterflood (Lorentzen, et al., 2006). To improve on these attempts several additions were made to the method. The first addition was to set constraints to the controls for optimization using a newly developed method that standardizes the controls using user defined constraints. The second addition was to define the weighting factor used for an iteration using the Golden Section Search algorithm. The third addition was to define the initial controls for the optimization using engineering judgment. "

                    "abstract": "Spontaneous and forced imbibition are recognized as important recovery mechanisms in naturally fractured reservoirs as the capillary force controls the movement of the fluid between the matrix and the fracture. For unconventional reservoirs, imbibition is also important as the capillary pressure is more dominant in these tighter formations, and the theoretical understanding of the flow mechanism for the imbibition process will benefit the understanding of important multiphase flow phenomenons like water blocking. In this paper, a new semi-analytic method is presented to examine the interaction between spontaneous and forced imbibition and to quantitatively represent the transient imbibition process. The methodology solves the partial differential equation of unsteady state immiscible, incompressible flow with arbitrary saturation-dependent functions using the normalized water flux concept, which is very identical to the fractional flow terminology used in traditional Buckley-Leverett analysis. The result gives a universal inherent relationship between time, normalized water flux, saturation profile and the ratio between co-current and total flux. The current analysis also develops a novel stability envelope outside of which the flow becomes unstable due to strong capillary forces, and the characteristic dimensionless parameter shown in the envelope is derived from the intrinsic properties of the rock and fluid system and can describe the relative magnitude of capillary and viscous forces at the continuum scale. This dimensionless parameter is consistently applicable in both capillary dominated and viscous dominated flow conditions. "

                    "abstract": "Recent research into transient reservoir response has developed a novel formulation of the diffusivity equation to model pressure, rate, and production, especially for unconventional reservoirs. This formulation characterizes the geometry of pressure propagation through a reservoir taking into account the heterogeneity of the reservoir and the boundary conditions which arise from multiple fractures and complex well completions. The formulation is derived from the asymptotic (high frequency) limit of the diffusivity equation for the impulse pressure solution. The formulation requires the solution of the Eikonal equation for the Diffusive Time of Flight (DToF) and the corresponding pore volume geometry contained within a Diffusive Time of Flight contour. Once the pore volume geometry is constructed, it may be used as the basis for either numerical or analytic solution. While numerical solutions are more general, the analytic approach is more readily applicable to production data analysis. The analytic approach may be used to determine two important field characteristics: the drainage volume of a well and the ratio of the produced volume to the drainage volume. In the pseudo steady state (PSS) limit, the latter would be the recovery factor for a reservoir. These quantities may be predicted from a model (for calibration purposes) or calculated directly from production data without resorting to any modeling. In this paper, we work directly with field production and pressure data to infer the drainage volume, and the instantaneous recovery ratio, defined as the ratio of the produced volume to the drainage volume. We also introduce a new w(τ) function that is related to a combined fracture and reservoir surface area. Our work draws upon the commonly used pressure transient and Rate Normalized Pressure (RNP) concepts. However, it specifically generalizes the concept of the drainage volume from PSS flow to transient flow, as is required for unconventional reservoirs, and then infers the underlying flow geometry to help differentiate and analyze different reservoir and fracture properties. The proposed formulation is applied to the analysis of the production data from shale oil reservoirs. The field data has been interpreted to describe the variations in performance characteristics seen in a number of wells. "

                    "abstract": "We present a novel and efficient approach to integrate frequent time lapse (4D) seismic data into high resolution reservoir models based on seismic onset times, defined as the calendar time when the seismic attribute crosses a pre-specified threshold value at a given location. Our approach reduces multiple time- lapse seismic survey data into a single map of onset times, leading to substantial data reduction for history matching while capturing all relevant information regarding fluid flow in the reservoir. Hence, the proposed approach is particularly well suited when frequent seismic surveys are available using permanently embedded sensors. Our history matching workflow consists of two stages: global and local. At the global stage of history matching, large-scale features such as regional permeabilities, pore volumes, temperature and fluid saturations are adjusted to match seismic and bottomhole pressure data using a Pareto-based multiobjective history matching workflow. Rather than an artificial subdivision of the domain, the history matching regions are naturally defined based on an eigen-decomposition of the grid Laplacian and a spectral clustering of the second eigenvector (fiedler vector). The global updating is followed by local history matching whereby cell permeabilities are adjusted to further refine the history match using semi- analytic, streamline-based model parameter sensitivities. The power and efficacy of our proposed approach is illustrated using synthetic and field applications. The field example involves steam injection into a heavy oil reservoir at Pad 31 in the Peace River Field (Alberta, Canada) with daily time lapse seismic surveys recorded by a permanently buried seismic monitoring system (Lopez et al. 2015). In our specific application, we have used time lapse data (in terms of two-way travel time) from a Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) cycle in the pad with a total of 175 seismic surveys. With a single onset time map derived from this data we were able to capture the propagation of pressure and saturation fronts and significantly improve the dynamic model through the estimation of permeability distribution, fluid saturation evolution and swept volume. With this methodology we correctly identified and further refined the location of stimulated zones as inferred before from reservoir engineering judgement and manual adjustments aiding better understanding of CSS behavior in the studied field. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the onset time approach for integrating large number of seismic surveys by compressing them into a single map. Also, the onset times appear to be relatively insensitive to the petro elastic model but sensitive to the steam/fluid propagation, making it a robust method for history matching of time lapse surveys.

This approach is particularly well-suited for the calibration of the reservoir properties of high-resolution geologic models because the seismic data are areally dense but sparse in time, whereas the production data are finely sampled in time but spatially averaged. The joint history matching is performed by use of streamline-based sensitivities derived from either finite-difference or streamline-based flow simulation. For the most part, earlier approaches have focused on the role of saturation changes, but the effects of pressure have largely been ignored. Here, we present a streamline-based semianalytic approach for computing model-parameter sensitivities, accounting for both pressure and saturation effects. The novelty of the method lies in the semianalytic sensitivity computations, making it computationally efficient for high-resolution geologic models. The approach is implemented by use of a finite-difference simulator incorporating the detailed physics. Its efficacy is demonstrated by use of both synthetic and field applications. For both the synthetic and the field cases, the advantages of incorporating the time-lapse variations are clear, seen through the improved estimation of the permeability distribution, the pressure profile, the evolution of the fluid saturation, and the swept volumes.

                    "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing treatment in naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs generally induce complex fracture geometries. Thus an unstructured grid, instead of a Cartesian or corner point grid, is preferred to accurately model the geometry of the fractures and the performance of such reservoirs. The drawback of conventional simulation on unstructured grids is the potentially heavy computational cost. A novel approach has recently been introduced to provide rapid simulation of unconventional reservoirs, which first captures the drainage volume during the transient propagation process using the Fast Marching Method (FMM) and then rapidly solves fluid flow equation in an equivalent 1D domain. However, this application is currently limited to calculating the reservoir response with Cartesian or corner-point grids. In this study, the FMM based simulation method is extended to unstructured grid. A new mesh generation approach is first presented to discretize the complex fracture network, accounting for both hydraulic fractures and natural fractures. Voronoi cells (or perpendicular bisector, i.e. PEBI grids) are constructed with high resolution near the fractures and with larger cells far from fractures. A force-equilibrium algorithm is adopted here to optimize the mesh quality and reduce highly skewed cells. FMM algorithm is computed on the basis of subdivided triangles, which can provide the diffusive time of flight (DToF) at both Voronoi cell vertices and cell centers. Thus, a more accurate calculation of drainage volume in unconventional reservoir with complex fracture networks can be obtained. Finally, fluid flow is calculated in transformed 1D domain, where DToF acts as the 1D spatial coordinate. Unstructured grids with good mesh quality are constructed to accurately capture the complex fracture network system. The convergence characteristic of FMM on unstructured grids is investigated. Reservoir simulation is efficiently computed based on the drainage volume information from the unstructured grid system using FMM, and the simulation results are validated with finite-difference based and finite-volume based numerical results. There are three key parts of this proposed approach, which are: (i) good mesh generation technique to capture complex fracture networks, (ii) FMM computation on unstructured grids to provide the drainage volume, and (iii) fluid flow calculation in transformed 1D domain. We extend the reservoir simulation using FMM in unconventional reservoirs from Cartesian and corner point grid systems to unstructured grids. The proposed approach shows orders of magnitude reduction in simulation time for modeling unstructured grids, bringing typical simulation times of hours or days down to minutes, which is quite attractive for high-resolution models. Through the numerical examples, the proposed method is demonstrated to be an accurate and efficient approach to simulate naturally fractured unconventional reservoirs with unstructured grids. "

In high contrast or low permeability systems the SS/PSS limit may not be reached during a simulation time step, introducing a potentially significant bias into an upscaling or downscaling calculation. We utilize an asymptotic pressure transient analysis to improve upon the resolution of these dynamic effects. The methodology is an application of the concepts of the diffusive time of flight and drainage volume to obtain source functions that capture both the transient and the long time limits of the flow patterns. Diffuse source (upstream) or sink (downstream) functions are introduced within each fine cell of a coarse cell pair with a specified total flow between them, computed at a characteristic time for pressure transients across the cells. The ratio of volume averaged flux and pressure gradient is used to obtain the effective transmissibility between the cell pair. The application of pressure transient concepts has allowed us to develop completely local upscaling and downscaling calculations. A characteristic time is determined for which the pressure transients cover the cell but for which the overall flow is still infinite acting, allowing a coarse cell flow characterization in terms of infinite acting linear flow. Unlike steady state upscaling calculations which explicitly impose flow on the boundaries of an upscaling region, and implicitly couple the local problem to a global flow field, these calculations are completely local. Similarly, where multiscale downscaling calculations may assume PSS flow to determine a fine scale local velocity, these assumptions may now be tested in terms of this characteristic time. This characteristic time may also be used to examine the impact of net / non-net cutoffs. The methodology is tested on SPE10 where we have permeabilities varying over 5 orders of magnitude making it high contrast in nature. The results demonstrate the utility of the local transient approach relative to steady state upscaling methods. "

                    "abstract": "Modeling of fluid flow in unconventional reservoirs requires accurate characterization of complex flow mechanisms because of the interactions between reservoir rock, microfractures, and hydraulic fractures. The pore-size distribution in shale and tight sand reservoirs typically ranges from nanometers to micrometers, resulting in ultralow permeabilities. In such extremely low-permeability reservoirs, desorption and diffusive processes play important roles in addition to heterogeneity-driven convective flows. For modeling shale and tight oil and gas reservoirs, we can compute the well-drainage volume efficiently with a fast marching method (FMM) and by introducing the concept of “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF). Our proposed simulation approach consists of two decoupled steps--drainage-volume calculation and numerical simulation with DTOF as a spatial coordinate. We first calculate the reservoir drainage volume and the DTOF with the FMM, and then the numerical simulation is conducted along the 1D DTOF coordinate. The approach is analogous to streamline modeling whereby a multidimensional simulation is decoupled to a series of 1D simulations resulting in substantial savings in computation time for high-resolution simulation. However, instead of a “convective time of flight” (CTOF), a DTOF is introduced to model the pressure-front propagation. For modeling physical processes, we propose triple continua whereby the reservoir is divided into three different domains: microscale pores (hydraulic fractures and microfractures), nanoscale pores (nanoporous networks), and organic matter. The hydraulic fractures/microfractures primarily contribute to the well production, and are affected by rock compaction. The nanoporous networks contain adsorbed gas molecules, and gas flows into fractures by convection and Knudsen diffusion processes. The organic matter acts as the source of gas. Our simulation approach enables high-resolution flow characterization of unconventional reservoirs because of its efficiency and versatility. We demonstrate the power and utility of our approach with synthetic and field examples. "

                    "abstract": "Waterflood, or other forms of immiscible displacement, have been the most widely used mechanism for secondary recovery and the determination of individual phase's relative permeability has been crucial for many reservoir engineering applications. Traditionally there are two ways of determining the relative permeability from laboratory experiments: the steady state experiment and the unsteady state experiment. The steady state experiment has the disadvantages of being time-consuming, obtaining few points on the relative permeability curves, as well as not being identical to the true reservoir displcacement process. On the other hand, the Johnson-Bossler-Naumann (JBN) method, based on Buckley-Leverett (B-L) immiscible displacement theory, is the standard procedure used to determine relative permeability from unsteady state experiments. However, the neglect of capillary pressure effect in the Buckley-Leverett theory has placed limitations on the method, such as requiring high flow rates. In order to remove the limitations of the displacement experiments and give more flexibility to the experiment configuration, an analytic model with capillary corrections is presented in the context of viscous dominated flow to study the impact caused by capillarity. The solution shows a fixed water-oil saturation bank at the outlet whose magnitude depends upon the wettability of the system. The analytic model is able to predict the saturation profile, considering capillarity, under various rock and fluid properties and experimental configurations. Therefore, the model could be used to calculate accurate relative permeability by matching experimental pressure drop and production reponses, correcting for capillarity. Also, through this method, a dimensionless parameter could be provided to quantify the effect caused by capillary end effect based on the length scale affected. It reflects the influence from a variety of aspects, not only from the experimental settings. "

The methodology was calibrated using hindcasting of production data from an area of the Eagle Ford oil window. Hindcasting, on an areal basis with 254 wells has demonstrated good results, with a coverage rate of true reserves of 78% for an 80% confidence interval (P90-P10) or 199 of the 254 wells tested. The novelty of the new model is in the implementation of the empirical decline curve equation for shale wells in Bayesian decline curve analysis with fast per well solution time on typical engineering computers This method offers many benefits. Principally, the method quantitatively assesses uncertainty and avoids subjective estimates of uncertainty. The results the method generates are accurate for shale wells because the decline curve equation was empirically designed for such wells. Furthermore, it generates replicable results for given wells regardless of the forecasting engineer and offers a fast calculation time of 5-10 seconds per well in the data set. The novel decline curve equation used in this methodology accommodates both early steep rate decline and later shallower decline with a smooth transition. Coupled with a Bayesian decline curve analysis process, the decline behavior of shale wells was assessed probabilistically with accuracy. The decline curve parameters are random variables with defined prior distributions. A MCMC simulation was performed to obtain the posterior distribution of well EUR's. Wells in the sample set had >36 months of production with the first 12 months used as simulation input. The method was calibrated (hindcasted) on an areal basis by measuring the coverage rate of \"true reserves.\" The method, when applied to the Eagle Ford oil shale production data, demonstrated good convergence to stationary posterior distributions of the parameters. This is important because field development of the Eagle Ford and other shale plays is improved when uncertainty is accurately quantified. By quantifying uncertainty and moving away from deterministic decline curve analysis using equations designed for conventional reservoirs, a better understanding of shale well EUR and behavior throughout a play is obtained.

                    "abstract": "Current industry practice for characterization and assessment of unconventional reservoirs mostly uses empirical decline-curve analysis or analytic rate- and pressure-transient analysis. High-resolution numerical simulation with local perpendicular bisector (PEBI) grids and global corner-point grids has also been used to examine complex nonplanar fracture geometry, interaction between hydraulic and natural fractures, and implications for the well performance. Although the analytic tools require many simplified assumptions, numerical-simulation techniques are computationally expensive and do not provide the more-geometric understanding derived from the depth-of-investigation (DOI) and drainage-volume calculations. We propose a novel approach for rapid field-scale performance assessment of shale-gas reservoirs. Our proposed approach is dependent on a high-frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and serves as a bridge between simplified analytical tools and complex numerical simulation. The high-frequency solution leads to the Eikonal equation (Paris and Hurd 1969), which is solved for a “diffusive time of flight” (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the “pressure front” in the reservoir. The Eikonal equation can be solved by use of the fast-marching method (FMM) to determine the DTOF, which generalizes the concept of DOI to heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs. It provides an efficient means to calculate drainage volume, pressure depletion, and well performance and can be significantly faster than conventional numerical simulation. More importantly, in a manner analogous to streamline simulation, the DTOF can also be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3D diffusivity equation to a 1D equation, leading to a comprehensive simulator for rapid performance prediction of shale-gas reservoirs. The speed and versatility of our proposed method makes it ideally suited for high-resolution reservoir characterization through integration of static and dynamic data. The major advantages of our proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal, and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the power and utility of our method by use of a field example that involves history matching, uncertainty analysis, and performance assessment of a shale-gas reservoir in east Texas. A sensitivity study is first performed to systematically identify the “heavy hitters” affecting the well performance. This is followed by history matching and an uncertainty analysis to identify the fracture parameters and the stimulated-reservoir volume. A comparison of model predictions with the actual well performance shows that our approach is able to reliably predict the pressure depletion and rate decline. "

The DTOF is obtained from the solution of the Eikonal equation via the Fast Marching Method. It may be used as a spatial coordinate which reduces the three dimensional diffusivity equation to an equivalent one dimensional formulation. We investigate the ‘pressure front’ propagation and the drainage volume evolution as a function of time in terms of the DTOF. The drainage volume may be directly related to the well test derivative which may be used in an inversion calculation to calibrate reservoir model parameters. The analytic sensitivity coefficients of well test derivative with respect to reservoir properties are derived and incorporated into the objective function to perform inverse modeling. The key to formulating the sensitivity coefficients is to utilize the functional derivative of the Eikonal equation to derive the analytic sensitivity of the DTOF to reservoir permeability and porosity. Its solution is implemented by differentiating the local solver within the Fast Marching Method (FMM). The major advantage of formulating sensitivity coefficients using the FMM is its great computational efficiency while inversion is conducted. Unlike the traditional means of estimating bulk reservoir permeability by interpreting the diagnostic plot of the well pressure and production data, the methodology adopted in this inverse modeling study can help generate more accurate spatial distributions of permeability through integration with a prior geologic model. Sensitivity studies are performed on synthetic permeability and porosity fields to analyze magnitudes of response in space and time to the well production. By taking sufficient a priori information into account, the permeability distribution after inversion matches well with reference reservoir model properties. Integration of the well test data into the subsurface using the FMM demonstrates that our proposed inverse modeling approach can predict pressure depletion behavior in the petroleum reservoir, while remaining consistent with a prior geologic static model.

                    "abstract": "Understanding how pressure fronts propagate (diffuse) in a reservoir formation is fundamental to welltest analysis and reservoir drainage volume estimation. We have developed an alternative approach to the solution of the 3-D diffusivity equation by directly solving the propagation equation for the \"pressure front\" defined as the maximum pressure response for an impulse source. The pressure front equation is a form of the Eikonal equation, which is a high frequency asymptotic solution of the diffusivity equation in heterogeneous reservoirs and whose properties are well developed in the literature. Most importantly, the Eikonal equation can be solved very efficiently by a class of solutions called the Fast Marching Methods (FMM) for a \"diffusive time of flight\" (DTOF) that governs the propagation of the \"pressure front\" in the reservoir. The \"diffusive time of flight\" can be used as a spatial coordinate to reduce the 3-D diffusivity equation into an equivalent 1-D formulation, leading to a simplified method for rapid reservoir modeling. Recent papers have explored the utility of this 1-D approach for performance prediction using finite difference numerical simulation. The method is especially well suited to the interpretation of the drainage volume, which is of great help in well spacing calculations and in the context of unconventional reservoirs, multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. In this paper we introduce an analytic solution technique for the diffusivity equation, which provides a direct relationship between production data and the reservoir drainage volume. The analytic formulation provides for the direct calculation and extension of many simple well test, rate transient and well performance concepts such as depth of investigation, welltest derivative, drainage volume, flow regimes and well productivity. As with other analytic approaches, these solutions allow superposition in space and in time, which allows for the solution for multiple wells, multiple flow rates, and bounded and composite reservoirs. We validate our approach against well-known solutions in pressure and rate transient analysis usually solved in Laplace space, including pressure transients with wellbore storage and skin. Our study demonstrates that the new approach yields results very close to the known solutions calculated via numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, and indicates how to extend these solutions to problems with heterogeneity and complex fractured well geometry.

However, as we extend our studies in higher resolution using multiscale calculations, or evaluate tighter or higher contrast heterogeneous or fractured reservoirs, capillarity becomes increasingly important. To improve the understanding of these situations, we have extended the analytic solution of the Buckley-Leverett equations to include capillarity. Specifically we have solved the incompressible waterflood flow equations along a streamtube or streamline with arbitrary cross-section for a heterogeneous porous media with variable injection water rate, including capillarity. The methodology is an application of a singular perturbation expansion with matched asymptotic solutions. The outer solution is identical to the continuous portion of the Buckley-Leverett saturation profile while the inner solution is the steady state solution first noted by Terwilliger experimentally. The two solutions match at the Buckley-Leverett shock saturation and all solutions can be expressed in closed form. The result of this analytical solution is tested against high resolution flow simulation to verify its validity. This analysis is also applied to the calculation of capillary end effects in laboratory core floods, where the length scale of the saturation correction can be predicted. We also demonstrate, as the shape of the saturation profile near the front depends upon the capillary pressure function, that this analytical solution can used to interpret experimental data and derive and calibrate the capillary pressure function.

                    "abstract": "Streamline-based history matching techniques have provided significant capabilities in integrating field-scale water-cut and tracer data into high resolution geologic models. The effectiveness of the streamline approach lies in the fact that parameter sensitivities can be computed analytically as one-dimensional integrals along streamlines and requires little additional computational overhead beyond the forward simulation. However, application of the streamline-based approach for simultaneous integration of water-cut and bottomhole pressure has been rather limited. This is partly because the convective streamlines appear to offer no particular advantage while computing parameter sensitivities for the bottomhole pressure data. This limits the utility of streamline-based history matching particularly for three-phase black-oil and compositional systems where the integration of pressure data is a requirement to accurately model reservoir depletion mechanisms. In this paper we first introduce a novel semi-analytic approach to compute the sensitivity of the bottomhole pressure data with respect to grid block properties. The approach takes advantage of the streamline trajectories and yields results that are comparable to sensitivities computed from adjoint methods, at a fraction of the computational cost. The bottomhole pressure sensitivities can be easily integrated with the water-cut, gas oil ratio or composition sensitivities for a joint inversion of pressure data using high resolution geologic models. An iterative least squared method (LSQR) is used to minimize a penalized objective function that includes the data misfit and appropriate ‘norm’ and ‘roughness’ penalty terms to preserve the prior model characteristics during the inversion. The proposed approach is well suited for both streamline and finite difference methods with access to streamlines, and has been generalized for application to three-phase and compositional systems by integrating water-cut, gas oil ratio, and bottomhole pressure data. We demonstrate the power and utility of our proposed method using synthetic and field examples. The synthetic examples include black-oil and compositional cases involving gas injection. The streamline-based sensitivities are compared with adjoint methods for verification purposes. We then apply the method to the Brugge benchmark case and the Norne field to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed method. "

Much of the current well-test analysis relies on solutions based on homogeneous or layered reservoirs. Well-test analysis in spatially heterogeneous reservoirs is complicated by the fact that Green’s function for heterogeneous reservoirs is difficult to obtain analytically. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for computing the depth of investigation and pressure response in spatially heterogeneous and fractured unconventional reservoirs. In our approach, we first present an asymptotic solution of the diffusion equation in heterogeneous reservoirs. Considering terms of highest frequencies in the solution, we obtain two equations: the Eikonal equation that governs the propagation of a pressure “front” and the transport equation that describes the pressure amplitude as a function of space and time. The Eikonal equation generalizes the depth of investigation for heterogeneous reservoirs and provides a convenient way to calculate drainage volume. From drainage-volume calculations, we estimate a generalized pressure solution on the basis of a geometric approximation of the drainage volume. A major advantage of our approach is that one can solve very efficiently the Eikonal equation with a class of front-tracking methods called the fast-marching methods. Thus, one can obtain transient-pressure response in multimillion-cell geologic models in seconds without resorting to reservoir simulators. We first visualize the depth of investigation and pressure solution for a homogeneous unconventional reservoir with multistage transverse fractures, and identify flow regimes from a pressure-diagnostic plot. And then, we apply the technique to a heterogeneous unconventional reservoir to predict the depth of investigation and pressure behavior. The computation is orders-of-magnitude faster than conventional numerical simulation, and provides a foundation for future work in reservoir characterization and field-development optimization. "

In addition to the production data, microseismic information is used to help us constrain the fracture extent and orientation and to estimate the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV).

We aspire to transfer both data and interpretations across a wide range of domains, often using a variety of software applications throughout the reservoir management life cycle. Keeping the model updated with new information while characterizing the range of uncertainty is a continual challenge. RESQML is the data exchange format used in the upstream oil and gas industry for transferring earth models between software applications in a vendor-neutral, open, and explicit format. RESQML V1.1 focused strictly on data exchange; only individual elements (such as interpreted picks, surfaces and reservoir grid) could be exchanged. In RESQML V2.0 (published in September 2014), capabilities have been expanded to provide a mechanism for transferring the relationship information between RESQML data-objects and to define more data-objects, for example, wells and unstructured simulation grids. With these new relationship capabilities, it is now possible to exchange structural & stratigraphic and reservoir frameworks, with their associated properties. This paper describes how the RESQML format has evolved from a single exchange of independent geometry and property representations of horizons, faults, and corner-point structured grids, to a comprehensive consistent earth model exchange that can capture, represent and transfer many of the relationships and interpretations contained in a reservoir model. Examples are drawn from the use cases and unit tests that demonstrate the use of RESQML to support partial model transfers, to describe structural and stratigraphic frameworks used in larger scale models (such as velocity models), and associate features and interpretations of those frameworks with specific representations, especially reservoir grids. The paper shows how these enhancements can be used to update and execute sensitivity workflows on a reservoir model, while describing uncertainty in the data used to build the reservoir framework. "

A main difficulty in identification of field-scale reservoir connectivity is the discrepancy between the low resolution of available field-scale pressure data and the high resolution of geologic models. In this paper, we propose a workflow for integration of pressure data for estimating large-scale reservoir connectivity. Since pressure variation represents a smooth function, we adopt an extremely low resolution (coarse scale) grid system for reservoir simulation. We generate the grid system through Delaunay triangulation by using the location of the static pressure measurements as control points and distribute the unstructured grid blocks according to the spatial resolution of the observations. Using flow-based upscaling, we create the initial coarse scale static simulation model from fine-scale geological model. Then, we use the ensemble Kalman filter to automatically adjust the global parameters such as aquifer strength, global continuity/discontinuity of reservoir properties, and fault transmissibilities to match the static pressure. The important advantages of the proposed workflow for characterization of field-scale reservoir connectivity from pressure data include very fast connectivity estimation with a low-order model and effective parameterization to reduce the number of unknowns to a level commensurate with the available static pressure measurements. We successfully apply our framework to data from real fields to illustrate its suitability and application to realistic reservoirs.

These models also represent the structure and stratigraphy of the reservoir within the design of the modeling grid, which may include fault blocks, faults, pinch-outs, layering and cross-bedding. The growth of computational resources has remained rapid, and both geologic models and flow simulation models have increased in size. 50 million cell geologic models are routine, while simulation models are typically one or two orders of magnitude coarser. Hence upscaling of the geologic models for flow simulation remains part of the subsurface workflows. The industry also faces new reservoir engineering challenges. Unconventional reservoirs (tight gas / shale oil / shale gas) have sufficiently low permeabilities that the time for pressure transients are no longer measured in hours or days, but instead are measured in decades or longer. The separation between transient testing and steady state reservoir management is no longer applicable. Similarly, our upscaling algorithms have relied upon steady state concepts of flow, which may no longer be applicable. In the current study, a novel diffuse source transmissibility upscaling approach is described. It applies pressure transient concepts to the calculation of the effective transmissibility between reservoir simulation coarse cell pairs. Unlike the usual steady state upscaling algorithms, it is a completely local calculation and is not dependent upon knowledge of, or assumptions about, global reservoir flow patterns. It is well suited to performance prediction within unconventional reservoirs as it utilizes drainage volume concepts to the calculation of coarse cell average pressures, although its use is not restricted to unconventional reservoirs. The approach is tested using the conventional reservoir SPE10 waterflood data set. It is then validated at field scale using an onshore US tight gas reservoir model. The approach is shown to reduce simulation run times by up to two orders of magnitude without significant loss of accuracy in performance prediction. "

                    "abstract": "History matching and optimization problems often involve several, potentially conflicting, objectives. For example, we might seek to minimize a misfit function involving differences in reservoir pressure, multiphase production history and 4D time-lapse seismic data and these differences do not always change in tandem. It is a common practice to treat these differences as a single objective optimization problem by aggregating all objectives into a scalar function (weighted-sum), resulting in incomplete exploration of the solution space. The problem is particularly severe if the objectives are conflicting. In this paper we propose to use a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) focusing on finding a set of optimal solutions called Pareto optima. The MOEA makes direct use of the dominance relation for fitness assignment instead of a fitness score in one-dimensional objective space. The dominance concept can define levels of optimality without reduction of objective dimensionality to sort populations accordingly, and the given populations constitute typically several ranks (fronts) of classification for individuals. Because it uses a population of solutions in the search process and optimizes such that the ranks are minimized, the Pareto optima can provide a measure of uncertainty in prediction. We show how the MOEA identifies optimal solutions by examining the trade-off between multiple objectives from a set of plausible solutions. Specifically, we demonstrate that it outperforms the commonly used weighted-sum approach. For practical applications, we provide a novel history matching workflow with a grid connectivity-based transformation (GCT) basis coefficients as parameters for calibration using the gradient-free evolutionary optimization algorithms. The basis functions are obtained from a spectral decomposition of the grid connectivity Laplacian and avoid ad hoc redefinitions of regions while preserving the geologic heterogeneity. We demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed workflow using multiple examples. These include 2D synthetic examples for validation and a 3D field application for matching production and seismic data with uncertainty and conflicting information. "

                    "abstract": "The effective use of streamline simulators for flow simulation of high resolution 3D models relies on the ability to take large simulation time-steps with few pressure solutions. For processes that are convective, the streamline approach works quite well, but for flow simulation with strong capillarity or gravity terms, the maximum time step size is reduced, limiting the utility of streamline simulation. The impact is particularly pronounced for compositional simulations that require numerous flash calculations. This paper presents the development of a 3D 3-phase compositional streamline simulator and its application to field-scale CO2 injection. The novel aspect of our approach is the ability to incorporate gravity and capillary effects into compositional streamline simulation without adversely impacting its computational efficiency. In our approach, we use an orthogonal projection method to reformulate the streamline transport equations so that the fluxes of capillary and gravity are separated into components parallel and orthogonal to the total velocity defining the streamline trajectories. Fluxes parallel to total velocity are included within the solution of the convective flow equations on streamlines. The remaining terms are calculated on the underlying three dimensional grid. Because the size of the remaining transverse flux correction terms is significantly reduced, we are able to take large time steps. The ability to effectively incorporate transverse fluxes in streamline transport calculations will be a step change in streamline simulation in general. We demonstrate that our proposed treatment of transverse fluxes allows us to efficiently study high resolution migration of CO2 in the subsurface with potential applications to both improved oil recovery as well as carbon sequestration. First, we establish the validity and computational efficiency of our approach using a series of numerical experiments in 3D with the benchmark SPE10 example. Next, we apply the method to a field-scale CO2 injection project in the North Sea. The streamline model is shown to be particularly effective to visualize the interactions between natural heterogeneity, capillary and buoyancy forces, and CO2 transport and the resulting impact on the vertical and areal sweep efficiencies. An optimal CO2 injection strategy is proposed to maximize the sweep efficiencies and incremental oil recovery. "

This approach is particularly well-suited for the calibration of the reservoir properties of high-resolution geologic models because the seismic data is areally dense but sparse in time, while the production data is continuous in time but averaged over interwell spacing. The joint history matching is performed using streamline-based sensitivities derived from either finite-difference or streamline-based flow simulation. Previous approaches to seismic data integration have mostly incorporated saturation effects but the pressure effects have largely been ignored. We propose, for the first time, streamline-based analytic approaches to compute parameter sensitivities that relate the seismic data to reservoir properties while accounting for both pressure and saturation effects via appropriate rock physics models. The inverted seismic data (e.g., changes in acoustic impedance or fluid saturations), is distributed as a 3-D high-resolution grid cell property or as a vertically integrated two-dimensional map. We derive pressure drop sensitivities along streamlines in addition to our previous work of water saturation sensitivity computation. The novelty of the method lies in the analytic sensitivity computations which make it computationally efficient for high resolution geologic models. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by implementing it in a finite difference simulator which incorporates detailed physical processes, while the streamline trajectories provide for rapid evaluation of the sensitivities. The efficacy of our proposed approach is demonstrated with both synthetic and field applications. The synthetic example is the SPE benchmark Brugge field case. The field example involves waterflooding of a North Sea reservoir with multiple seismic surveys. For both the synthetic and the field cases, the advantages of incorporating the time-lapse variations are clearly demonstrated through improved estimation of the permeability distribution, pressure profile, and fluid saturation evolution and swept volumes.

Through this unified vision, the RESQML V2 data standard will allow drillers and production engineers to seamlessly access reservoir characterization and simulation results, and allow the reservoir engineers to benefit from the entire range of well-based drilling, petrophysical, and production data within an integrated team. This paper presents how the RESQML V2 design allows association of WITSML and RESQML dedicated objects, and how to establish the relationships between these new objects and the structural, stratigraphic, and reservoir elements inside a RESQML model. In part, this integration has been enabled by the new Energistics Open Packaging Conventions (EPC), which allows multiple data standards (not only RESQML and WITSML) to be recognized and managed consistently. This integration provides the foundation for future RESQML work, including plans to integrate the WITSML Completion dataobject, and seismic data (represented in either time or space), both in the reservoir and at the wells.

                    "abstract": "The Bakken boom in North Dakota is currently focused on the Central Basin area where around half of the drilling rigs in North Dakota are now operating. What makes this area different compared to previous areas of Bakken development is that there is only minor structural variation and significantly less naturally induced fracturing as compared to the higher permeability rock facies that exist in the sub-reservoirs of earlier Bakken development such as at the Elm Coulee field in Montana or the Sanish and Parshall fields in North Dakota. As a consequence, the role of the well's completion and stimulation design has a greater significance and impact on well productivity and ultimate recovery. Different companies have taken very different approaches to well design using either plug and perf or ball and sleeve completions, and a variety of fracture designs with slickwater, hybrid or cross-linked gel fluids and a variety of proppants from 100% natural sand to 100% ceramics. As a consequence, it is not uncommon for different operators to have over a 2 million dollar difference in their AFE's solely because of the differences in approach to the well's completion and stimulation design. The authors have chosen to apply \"advanced completion and stimulation designs?? which are designed to maximize the reservoir contact area (slickwater and plug and perf) and optimize the conductivity (ceramic proppant at relatively high volumes).1,2 In order to benchmark performance of its completion and stimulation program the authors in 2010 developed a production and completion database of all wells completed in the Central Basin using publicly available information from the North Dakota Industrial Commission's records augmented by additional completions information obtained directly from the operators. From an initial dataset of ~30 wells the database has been updated monthly and has now grown to over 1100 wells in the Central Basin from 28 operators. Benchmarking of completion performance has been performed using the above database together with a Petra geological database developed from all publicly available logs in the Central Basin (~500 vertical wells which had been drilled and logged prior to the first Bakken horizontal well). Benchmarking of performance is somewhat subjective in the Bakken (as well as most reservoirs) due to variations in reservoir quality. Without geological input (reservoir quality), the acquired data were too scattered to achieve meaningful correlations to completion methods unless the area was limited to ensure similar reservoir quality for the wells being evaluated. By narrowing the analysis to very limited areas; this also reduced the input as to the number and type of completion methods being compared. Multivariate analysis methods, that included geological input, were used to benchmark performance over most of the Williston Central Basin, allowing comparison of the varied completion methods for 28 operators and over a thousand wells. Using multiple parameters an excellent correlation for completion methodology versus reservoir quality was obtained. While early analysis focused on 30, 60 and 90-day cumulative production; in the past year there have been enough wells to generate performance metrics based on 180 and 365-day cumulative production since over 600 wells have now been on production for at least a year.

                    "abstract": "Exploration and production workflows are evolving in complexity. We aspire to transfer both data and interpretations across a wide domain range, often using a variety of software applications throughout the reservoir management life cycle. Keeping the model updated with new information while characterizing the range of uncertainty is a continual challenge. RESQML is the data exchange format used in the upstream oil and gas industry for transferring earth models between software applications in a vendor-neutral, open and explicit format. RESQML V1.1 focused strictly on data exchange. A key goal for RESQML V2 is to provide a mechanism to transfer relationship information (between data-objects, such as faults, horizons and grids), while continuing to expand the fundamental data types within the standard, for example, unstructured simulation grids. This paper describes how the RESQML format is evolving from a single exchange of independent geometry and property representations of horizons, faults, and corner-point structured grids to a comprehensive consistent earth model exchange that is able to capture and understand all the successive steps contained within a reservoir model. As an example, we explain the advantage of the RESQML V2 model versus the earlier RESCUE and RESQML V1.1 data models to associate horizon interpretations with reservoir grids all along the reservoir life cycle. We demonstrate use cases that show how these enhancements can be used to update and execute sensitivity workflows on a reservoir model, while describing uncertainty in seismic horizon picks used to build the structural framework.

                    "abstract": "The effective use of streamline simulators for flow simulation of multi-million cell detailed 3D models relies on the ability to take large simulation time-steps with few pressure solutions. For processes that are convective, the streamline approach works quite well while for flow simulation with compressibility, strong capillarity or strong gravity terms, the maximum time step size may be substantially reduced, limiting the utility of streamline simulation. This is the case when applying the conventional streamline operator-splitting approach, where the nonlinear terms associated with capillarity and gravity limit the time step. Earlier studies have shown the importance of an \"anti-diffusive?? correction in which numerical dispersion from the convective solution must be removed before capillary pressure can be accurately modeled. Evaluation of the antidiffusive term involves the solution of a local Riemann problem which, unfortunately, is difficult to determine in full field multi-dimensional problems with heterogeneity, and spatially variable viscosity, fluid velocity, and saturations. The alternative approach is to perform the operating splitting calculation with very small time-steps to minimize the numerical dispersion, but this is not an effective simulation strategy.  In our approach, the equations are reformulated so that all of the flux terms including capillarity and gravity forces are solved simultaneously with the streamline convection equations. We utilize an orthogonal projection method in which the fluxes of capillary and gravity are separated into components parallel and orthogonal to the total velocity. Fluxes parallel to total velocity are included within the solution of the convective flow equations on streamlines. The remaining terms are calculated on the underlying three dimensional grid. With the introduction of this orthogonal-projection, there is no longer a need for an anti-diffusive correction. This formulation still uses an operator splitting approach, but the size of the remaining transverse flux correction terms are reduced, allowing for large time steps.  We demonstrate the utility and validity of our approach using a series of increasingly complex numerical experiments in 1D and 2D including the 3D SPE10 reservoir model. We compare our results to a commercial finite difference simulator, and to a streamline simulator using a conventional operator splitting approach, but without the anti-diffusive correction. We obtain a good match to the saturation distribution and production profile using large time steps, compared to the small time steps required for conventional operator splitting. The 2D and 3D examples clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the orthogonal projection approach in minimizing the transverse flux allowing for the larger time steps. It also provides a systematic means of including additional displacement mechanisms in the future. "

                    "abstract": "Unconventional reservoirs are characterized by sufficiently low permeabilities so that the pressure depletion from a producing well may not propagate far from the well during the life of a development. This is in contrast to conventional plays where the pressure transients may probe the entire reservoir in weeks to months. The concept of depth of investigation and its application to unconventional reservoirs provide the understanding necessary to describe and optimize the interaction between complex multi-stage fractured wells, reservoir heterogeneity, drainage volumes, pressure depletion, well rates, and the estimated ultimate recovery.  Previous studies have performed unconventional reservoir analysis using more conventional reservoir simulation techniques. High resolution local PEBI grids and global corner point grids have been used to represent complex fracture geometry and conductivity and estimate subsequent well performance. However, these techniques do not provide the more geometric understanding provided by the depth of investigation and drainage volumes.  The application of the depth of investigation to heterogeneous reservoirs can be obtained from an asymptotic expansion of the diffusivity equation leading to the Eikonal equation which describes the propagation of the pressure front. This equation is solved using a Fast Marching Method to calculate a diffusive time of flight at every location within the domain. The diffusive time of flight is directly related to pressure front propagation. Unlike in a reservoir simulator, this frontal propagation is determined in a single non-iterative calculation, which is extremely fast. Once the pressure fronts are determined spatially, we may apply a pseudo-steady state pressure approximation within the moving front to determine pressure depletion and well rates.  In the current study, we extend the Fast Marching Method for solution of the Eikonal equation to complex simulation grids including corner point and unstructured grids. This allows the rapid approximation of reservoir simulation results without the need for flow simulation, and also provides the time-evolution of the well drainage volume for visualization. Understanding the drainage volume alone is useful for well spacing and multi-stage fracture spacing optimization. Additional potential applications include well trajectory and hydraulic fracture location optimization, reservoir model screening and ranking, matrix/fracture parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and production data integration.

                    "abstract": "Reservoir management and simulation of tight gas reservoirs pose several interesting technical challenges. Accurate simulation estimates of the effectiveness of multi-stage fracturing, well rates, the interaction between multiple fractures, and between the reservoir and fractures requires high resolution gridding near the well. These predictions have been achieved in the past through the design of LGR (Local Grid Refinement) grids, or through the use of fractured well indices or cell permeabilities. The latter techniques are based upon steady state concepts and are less able to resolve well rate transients compared to the use of LGR grids. Decisions on well counts, spacing, and timing also depend upon the interaction between wells. These simulations face specific challenges due to the geology of these reservoirs: in addition to the permeability being low, the connectivity of these reservoirs is intermittent due to the three dimensional spatial patterns of sand deposition and subsequent diagenesis. If these reservoir models are over-averaged or not carefully upscaled, the barriers between sands and internal heterogeneity will be lost, leading to far too optimistic estimates of lateral continuity and under-estimates of infill requirements. The need for accurate flow simulation of these systems has led to the development of spatially adaptive upscaling techniques that honor the vertical discontinuities of the sands in the design of the coarsened simulation grid and which also preserves the heterogeneity within sands. In the current study, these two approaches have been combined, providing a model with both high resolution and computational efficiency. Starting with a high resolution 3D geologic model, the simulation grid is designed using refinement at the fractured wells, and successively coarsened away from the well, leading to an unstructured numerical problem. Away from the wells, the vertical coarsening utilizes the \"pillar-based?? adaptive coarsening of Zhou and King, 2011. Simulation is performed using a next generation unstructured commercial simulator. We will report upon the performance of the different techniques in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and how they are impacted by different implementations of the multiscale simulation grid design.

(2) Offers no guidance on the requirements of spatial resolution, and how this choice may vary depending the stage of field life or reservoir processes, e.g., a pressure history match versus the modeling of a secondary or tertiary process. (3) Offers no guidance on the nature of the geologic model: its characteristics, its level of detail, or its structure. (4) Provides no description of the history matching process itself, nor the choices available to a practitioner.

                    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to calculate drainage volume and well performance in shale gas reservoirs using a Fast Marching Method (FMM) combined with a geometric pressure approximation. Our approach can fully account for complex fracture network geometries associated with multistage hydraulic fractures and their impact on the well pressure and rates. The major advantages of our proposed approach are its simplicity, intuitive appeal and computational efficiency. For example, we can compute and visualize the time evolution of the well drainage volume for multimillion cell geologic models in seconds without resorting to reservoir simulation. A geometric approximation of the drainage volume is then used to compute the well rates and the reservoir pressure. The speed and versatility of our proposed approach makes it ideally suited for parameter estimation via inverse modeling of shale gas performance data. We utilize experimental design to perform the sensitivity analysis to identify the ‘heavy hitters' and a genetic algorithm to calibrate the relevant fracture and matrix parameters in shale gas reservoirs by history matching of production data. In addition to the production data, microseismic information is utilized to help us constrain the fracture extent and orientation and to estimate the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). The proposed approach is applied to a fractured shale gas well. The results clearly show reduced uncertainty in the estimated fracture parameters and SRV, leading to improved forecasting and reserve estimation. Introduction Shale gas production has become an important share of U.S. energy supply, driven to a large extent by the advances in horizontal well completion technology and multistage hydraulic fracturing. To reliably estimate shale gas reserves and ultimate recoveries, it is important to predict shale gas well performance accounting for the relevant reservoir and fracture parameters. Currently decline curve analysis (Fetkovich 1980; Valko and Lee 2010) and pressure/rate transient analysis (Ilk et al. 2010; Song and Ehlig-Economides 2011; Clarkson et al. 2012) are two types of widely used analytical methods for production forecasting in shale gas well development. The methods in decline curve analysis are largely curve-fitting used to forecast production via extrapolation and obtain the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). In pressure/rate transient analysis, fracture properties are first estimated from identified flow regimes and then well production is predicted with the estimated properties. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The concept of depth of investigation is fundamental to well test analysis. Much of the current well test analysis relies on solutions based on homogeneous or layered reservoirs. Well test analysis in spatially heterogeneous reservoirs is complicated by the fact that Green's function for heterogeneous reservoirs is difficult to obtain analytically (Deng and Horne 1993). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for computing the depth of investigation and pressure response in spatially heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs.  In our approach, we first present an asymptotic solution of the diffusion equation in heterogeneous reservoirs. Considering terms of highest frequencies in the solution, we obtain two equations: the Eikonal equation that governs the propagation of a pressure ‘front' and the transport equation that describes the pressure amplitude as a function of space and time. The Eikonal equation generalizes the depth of investigation for heterogeneous reservoirs and provides a convenient way to calculate drainage volume. From drainage volume calculations, we estimate a generalized pressure solution based on a geometric approximation of the drainage volume. A major advantage of our approach is that the Eikonal equation can be solved very efficiently using a class of front tracking methods called the Fast Marching Methods (FMM). Thus, transient pressure response can be obtained in multimillion cell geologic models in seconds without resorting to reservoir simulators.  We first visualize depth of investigation and pressure solution for a homogeneous reservoir with multi-stage transverse fractures and identify flow regimes from pressure diagnostic plot. And then, we apply the technique to a heterogeneous reservoir to predict depth of investigation and pressure behavior. The computation is orders of magnitude faster than conventional numerical simulation and provides a foundation for future work in reservoir characterization and field development optimization.  Introduction Unconventional resources are playing an increasingly important role in energy supply worldwide, especially in the United States. To estimate reservoir properties and optimize hydraulic fracture design in unconventional reservoirs, well test analysis (pressure transient and rate transient analysis) is widely used. In the area of well test analysis (Gringarten 1984, 2010; Ehlig-Economides 1992), the concepts of radius of investigation (Lee 1982; Raghavan 1993) and depth of investigation (Datta-Gupta et al. 2011) are fundamental to estimate reserves, understand drainage volume and identify infill drilling location (Kang et al. 2011). These concepts can also be used in unconventional reservoirs to help planning horizontal well, optimizing multi-stage hydraulic fractures (Sehbi et al. 2011), and understanding stimulated reservoir volume (Yin et al. 2011). Kuchuk (2009) recently summarized several definitions of radius of investigation. Most of them rely on analytical solutions based on homogeneous or layered reservoirs. However, these analytical solutions have limited applicability and are difficult to generalize to arbitrary reservoir conditions and well locations. "

                    "abstract": "The effective strategies for traditional manual history matching commonly follow a structured approach with a sequence of adjustments from global to regional parameters followed by local changes in model properties, associated with matching for pressure (reservoir energy), flood front progression, and individual well performance. In contrast, many of the automatic history matching methods utilize parameter sensitivities or gradients to directly update the fine-scale reservoir properties, potentially combining elements at all of these scales. In this paper we present a hierarchical streamline-assisted history matching approach that emulates the traditional structured procedures. First, a probabilistic approach is used to understand the uncertainty in the large-scale static and dynamic parameters, and to calibrate these global parameters. In this global calibration, the intent is to develop multiple models that all match the field performance. This global calibration is followed by a streamline sensitivity-based deterministic model calibration for local permeability changes in which each of the distinct models created in the global match are history matched in additional detail. In the probabilistic global calibration, design of experiments and response surface methodologies with evolutionary algorithms are used to calibrate the global parameters. Typical parameters are regional pore volume multipliers, regional vertical and areal transmissibility multipliers, fault transmissibilities and aquifer strength. Key global parameters are first identified via a sensitivity analysis and an initial ensemble of models that span these parameters is created. The cases studied in this sensitivity analysis are used to construct a proxy model using experimental design and response surface analysis. An improved genetic algorithm with heat-bath sampling is used to generate an updated ensemble of models conditioned to static MDT pressures and total liquid rates at the wells, corresponding to a traditional pressure history match. Next, each ensemble member is updated using water-cut, GOR and flowing BHP via sensitivity-based local permeability calibration. We utilize streamline-derived analytic sensitivities to determine the spatial distribution and magnitude of these local changes. The proposed approach was tested by a 3D synthetic case and a field application. Our hierarchical approach appears to be stable in the sense that the local changes for permeability (inner loop) do not invalidate the pressure history match (outer loop). This is not entirely unexpected since the local permeability changes are regularized by a norm constraint that minimizes deviations from the globally updated model. Nonetheless, this is a very useful property in that it allows us to powerfully combine history matching procedures on global and local scales. "

                    "abstract": "The concept of radius of investigation is fundamental to well test analysis and is routinely used to design well tests and to understand the reservoir volume investigated. The radius of investigation can also be useful in identifying new well locations and planning, designing and optimizing hydraulic fractures in unconventional reservoirs. It has additional implications in estimating reserves and understanding stimulated reservoir volumes. There are many definitions of radius of investigation in the literature and Kuchuk (2009) summarized them recently. Although these definitions vary in detail, they all relate to the propagation of a pressure disturbance or impose thresholds on detectable pressure or rate changes. In this article we will focus on the definition proposed by Lee (1982). Lee defines the radius of investigation as the propagation distance of the “peak” pressure disturbance for an impulse source or sink. For simplified flow geometries and homogeneous reservoir conditions, the radius of investigation can be calculated analytically. However, such analytic solutions are severely limited for heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, particularly for unconventional reservoirs with multistage hydraulic fractures. Generalization of the Concept How can we generalize the concept of radius of investigation to heterogeneous reservoir conditions including unconventional reservoirs with horizontal wells and multistage hydraulic fractures? For such general situations, it will be more appropriately called “the depth of investigation” rather than the radius of investigation. The simplest, not necessarily the most desirable, approach will be to use a numerical reservoir simulator. For example, we can simulate a constant rate drawdown test and observe the pressure response at every grid block in the simulation model. It is as if, we have distributed sensors throughout the reservoir. We can now compute the time derivative of the pressure at each grid block and note the time when the derivative reaches a maximum. We can then simply contour this “peak” arrival time at every grid block. Note that because the constant rate test corresponds to a step function (from 0 to Q), its derivative is an impulse function. Thus, by contouring the arrival time of the maximum of the pressure derivative, we are actually looking at the arrival time of the maximum of an impulse response as defined by Lee (1982). How well does the approach work? Fig. 1a shows the evolution of the radius of investigation for homogeneous radial flow using Lee’s analytic solution. Fig. 1b shows the radius of investigation obtained from numerical simulation. We have superimposed the analytic solution (black lines) on the results from the numerical simulation. We do see a close correspondence, although the numerical results have difficulties resolving the pressure transients away from the well. In spite of its limitations, the numerical approach is very general and can be applied to arbitrary reservoir and well conditions. The computation time and expenses, however, make the numerical simulation approach unfeasible for routine applications. "

                    "title": "Improved Upscaling for Flow Simulation of Tight Gas Reservoir Models",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Tight gas and shale gas reservoirs provide almost half of the current U.S. domestic gas production, with significant projected increases in the next several decades. These reservoirs constitute an important play type, with opportunities for improved reservoir management in the optimization of depleted volumes as functions of well spacing and fractured well design.  Reservoir simulation, together with detailed 3D geologic models, may be used for improved management, but only if the flow simulation through these models can capture the essential heterogeneity and 3D continuity of these intermittently connected rock packages. The current work will examine tight gas reservoirs, but we recognize that similar issues will arise in source rock plays.  The current approach has three key technical elements: (1) We explicitly preserve the local continuity of the reservoir sands in the geologic model through the design of the simulation grid. Each simulation cell is a 1x1xN amalgamation of the geologic scale corner point cells, where \"N?? will vary depending upon the local sand thickness. (2) We have developed a \"Well Index?? based upscaling, to determine the upscaled permeability and which preserves the local reservoir quality. It does not require knowledge of the well locations within the upscaled simulation model, but it will preserve the performance of these wells. (3) The heterogeneity within each sand is preserved through the use of transmissibility upscaling, which we show performs systematically better than the usual permeability upscaling. In combination, these three elements provide simulation results which are almost indistinguishable from the fine scale model. We also examine additional approximations in which we further coarsen the model areally, and reduce the simulation time further. We develop and demonstrate our calculations on a sector model taken from the center of a full field onshore U.S. tight gas reservoir. The results are then validated using the full field model.  Our approach differs from earlier studies which have attempted to preserve the global heterogeneity of the reservoir models though layer-based statistical calculations. Although these statistical approaches are superior to uniformly coarsened models, they are not as robust or as accurate as the current work constrained by local continuity. Our approach also differs in the use of accurate property upscaling techniques that simultaneously preserve the internal contrast of permeability within each sand, and the performance of wells within the model.  Introduction Recovery from a conventional gas reservoir may be understood using a simple P/z analysis based upon mass balance. This may be thought of as the end result of an upscaling calculation in which the entire reservoir is represented by a single coarse cell. In contrast, tight gas reservoirs cannot be successfully analyzed in this fashion. Instead, with their low values of porosity and especially permeability, the reservoir may be sufficiently tight that the pressure transients from the production wells may not reach the extent of the reservoir during the economic life of a well. Without the concept of an equilibrium or average reservoir pressure, the play may need to be thought of as a sum of production curves for each well, instead of as a single reservoir monitored using a P/z curve. Secondly, they differ in their geologic descriptions. Continued infill field development at increased well density for tight gas reservoirs has shown that tight gas sands typically do not deplete uniformly. Sands that are not well connected to the initial wells will offer infill development opportunities which would not be present in a well connected conventional gas reservoir. Finally, they also differ in well and reservoir rates. All wells will be fractured to obtain enhanced production, and the loss of mobility due to liquid production makes the occurrence of multiphase flow in the tight gas reservoir problematic. "

                    "abstract": "Full-field flow simulators use a variety of cell geometries, ranging from simple rectangles to complex corner-point systems. One of the benefits of corner-point cells is the ease with which we may represent faulted reservoirs. Each face of a cell may be juxtaposed to two or more cells, depending on the fault throw and the lateral displacements of adjacent cells. Conventional finite-difference approaches routinely include the flux between these cells as \"non-neighbor\" connections. Other examples of non-neighbor or nonstandard connections occur at the boundary of local grid refinement (LGR) or local grid coarsening (LGC) regions where two computational grids come into juxtaposition. In each of these instances, the velocity across the nonstandard faces of a cell will be unevenly distributed according to the non-neighbor fluxes. In contrast, the standard streamline velocity interpolation model (Pollock's scheme) used within a cell assumes that the flux is evenly distributed on each cell face, inconsistent with the non-neighbor connection fluxes. Streamlines traced with such an approach do not have sufficient degrees of freedom to be consistent with the finite-difference fluxes and, consequently, will not follow a physical flow path. We propose a strategy that provides a consistent representation for streamlines and velocities near faults and non-neighbor connections. Our approach is based on a simple local (boundary layer) refinement construction that can be used to honor the fluxes at each face, without affecting the representation of flow within the cell or on any other cell face. The local refinement construction is the simplest extension to three dimensions for faulted reservoir cells that provides consistency with the finite difference flux calculation. Several examples will be presented for a single pair of cells juxtaposed across a fault and at LGR boundaries to illustrate the difficulties in conventional tracing algorithms and the benefits of our approach. The practical utility of our algorithm is demonstrated in a structurally complex and heavily faulted full-field model. The reservoir geometry includes multiple cells with complex fault juxtaposition and several non-neighbor configurations in different faces. This treatment is contrasted with the usual approach, and the implications for reservoir scale fluid flow tracing by streamlines is examined "

There are numerous sources, which provide a comprehensive list of such metrics categorized into leading or lagging and technical or social. However, the significance of these metrics to overall risk and resilience assessment of the system is not well established. Process Resilience Analysis Framework (PRAF) is an advanced method of risk assessment with three phases – avoidance; survival; and recovery, which include twenty-four resilience metrics covering both technical and social factors. In this paper, we are reporting on the statistical analysis of the resilience metrics survey conducted within the process industry. The survey respondents present a wide variety of experience and employment sectors. This paper aims to answer the following three research questions related to resilience metrics– what are the most important metrics for each of the 3 phases?; are there any differences in viewpoints of various groups of survey respondents?; and what is the relative level of importance for each of the metrics? Answers to these research questions are critical in the quantification of overall process resilience and also provide the essential information for senior management to make informed risk decisions. Therefore, a PRAF survey based on Likert type questionnaire was conducted, which produced categorical responses. Methods and techniques such as ordinal alpha, Kruskal-Wallis test, and polychoric correlations, relevant to analyze categorical responses have been used in the programming language R. "

                    "abstract": "The Chemical Process Industry has witnessed an increase in process safety challenges and changes in the global public perception of risk. The key hazard identification and analysis methods used in the industry follow a univariate analysis which limits them in their approach to consider multiple factors, complex interactions among system components, and their relationships. It is evident that the majority of incidents are a result of human, organizational, mechanical, and operational failures. Most methods lack the anticipation element as well as the full scenario anatomy of incident–initiation, propagation, and termination. Furthermore, the incompleteness of possible scenarios may lead to the reduction or absence of essential risk reduction measures. The hazard analysis method for a complex socio-technical system, such as a process plant, should incorporate the following characteristics: consideration of all system components (e.g., processes, human operations, equipment, instruments, and control systems), all plausible deviations, a multi-disciplinary team, and proper documentation. Analyzing the extent of the resilience of the whole system, with respect to the plant and management system layers and strengthening weaknesses, is expected to result in significant reduction of unexpected failures and threats to develop and terminate as mishaps. To this end, in Part I (Jain et al., 2018b), the paper presented the Resilience-based Integrated Process Systems Hazard Analysis (RIPSHA), proposed a bi-layered approach that takes two distinct layers into account, and treated the second layer called the Plant System. In Part II, the first layer, called the Management System is presented that comprises three rational sub-systems for analysis-process safety culture and leadership, operational discipline, and process safety systems. This work establishes and presents worksheets and guidewords based on resilience metrics for management systems hazard analysis. The paper closes with a case study on tank explosion accident to illustrate the key concepts of the management system layer hazard analysis. "

While IMTs have been studied as a decision-making unit, few attempts were made to view them from a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) perspective that highlights the interplay among humans and technical agents and demands imposed by the incident. To that end, this paper presents a JCS model of the IMT grounded in findings from the existing literature and naturalistic observations of simulated IMT's incident action planning, which functions in a cyclic manner across multiple scales. Using this model, three measures for resilience of the IMT, recovery time, resource status, and interactions, are discussed. To effectively represent the resilient performance incorporating these measures, a novel adoption of the Interactive Episode Analysis method is utilized. By providing a few examples of the analysis method, this study provides proof-of-concept for objective assessment of the resilience characteristics of the IMT. The proposed JCS-based IMT model can be used for descriptive modeling of similar systems to investigate resilient performance. "

                    "abstract": "Liquefaction of natural gas is an effective way of easily storing and transporting natural gas because of its high ratio of liquid to vapor densities. Any spill of liquefied natural gas (LNG) can result in the formation of a vapor cloud, which cannot only cause asphyxiation but can also migrate downwind near ground level because of a density greater than air and has the potential to ignite. The NFPA recommends the use of high expansion foam to mitigate the vapor risk due to cryogenic LNG. This paper studies the effects of heat transfer mechanisms, such as forced convection and thermal radiation on high expansion foam breakage, with and without a cryogenic liquid. A lab scale foam generator was used to produce high expansion foam and carry out experiments to evaluate the rate of foam breakage, the amount of liquid drained from foam, the vaporization rate of the cryogenic liquid, and the temperature profile through the foam. High expansion foam breakage was found to depend on the amount of wind induced forced convection and thermal radiation. At the highest wind speed (2.5 m/s) and thermal radiation intensity (270 W/m2) measured, foam breakage was found to be nearly 3 and 5 times the value without any wind or thermal radiation, respectively. Liquid drainage from the foam was found to affect the vaporization rate of the cryogenic liquid, especially immediately after foam application. Accounting for external factors such as forced convection and thermal radiation can help provide a better estimate for the amount of foam that needs to be applied for effective vapor risk mitigation.

                    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, the demand for hydrogen has significantly grown. Its high-energy content and relatively small environmental effect make it an ideal energy source and chemical feedstock. However, the perceived high risk of hydrogen in the eyes of society is a key challenge that has to be addressed before any future widespread utilization of hydrogen can be achieved. In this study, the consequences of unconfined hydrogen releases are evaluated using a computational fluid dynamics simulation software, FLACS, to determine the potential to explode. In addition, the study includes the analysis of parameters that can promote hydrogen vapor cloud explosion, e.g., initial pressure, time to ignition, and leak height position. The results conclude that high-pressure hydrogen has the potential to build up a large vapor cloud and may explode even without confinement when the leak source is close to the ground. The highest overpressure produced in the simulation was 0.71 barg, which resulted from igniting a hydrogen gas cloud from a 207 bar hydrogen source leaking at 1 m height. The high overpressure suggests that hazard studies for hydrogen leaks near the ground should not assume a free flow jet release. This study also gives a recommended distance from a high-pressure hydrogen processing unit to nearby occupied buildings to use in conjunction with industrial spacing tables for fire hazards. "

                    "abstract": "During the last decade, inherent safety has emerged as an area of interest in both academic and industrial research. Various regulatory bodies have enforced the consideration of inherently safer design alternatives. This enforcement, however, may not serve the purpose of reducing the risk associated with process incidents due to the drawback of risk migration associated with inherent design philosophy. The philosophy of inherent safety has emerged from the need to reduce the consequence element of risk with an objective to prevent high consequence–low likelihood events. Thus, this philosophy is plagued with the drawback of risk migration where the lowering of consequence element can lead to an undesired increased likelihood element, leading to an overall increase in risk associated with the system. The likelihood element of risk of the system under consideration depends on the system reliability. The developed methodology involves quantifying inherent safety based on the design stage under consideration using a quantification technique that utilizes process data available during the specific stage of design. This is followed by determining reliability and availability of the system using reliability databases or static reliability modeling for various design alternatives considered during the specific design stage. Lastly, the trend observed between quantified inherent safety and reliability/availability is used to determine the required relationship between inherent safety and reliability. Thus, this developed methodology evaluates the possibility of increased risk due to lowered system reliability caused by the implementation of inherent design philosophy. "

Recent interest in finding replacements for Halon 1301 has provided an impetus to reconsider OPCs. To better understand the mechanism by which OPCs suppress flames, more information about how they interact with fuel/air mixtures via chemical kinetics is needed. In this study, dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP), and trimethyl phosphate (TEP) were added to hydrogen/air and methane/air mixtures to assess their suppression capabilities at 0.1% and 0.3% (DMMP only) of the total mixture volume. Laminar flame speed experiments were performed in an optically tracked, spherically expanding flame setup at 1 atm and 120 °C. The resulting laminar flame speed data are the first to be recorded using these compounds. Results show a 30% decrease in laminar flame speed for all OPCs at 0.1% on the methane/air parent mixture, and the laminar flame speed curves, as a function of equivalence ratio, tend to be broader than for un-doped mixtures. For the hydrogen/air mixtures, the OPCs differentiate themselves by having an increasing suppression effect corresponding with higher carbon moiety, i.e., TEP (15% overall reduction) > DEMP (13%) > DMMP (9%). The OPCs also have an increasing effect with increasing equivalence ratio on hydrogen/air, but with methane/air, they have a non-monotonic effect. The reduction of laminar flame speeds is comparable to twice the concentration of Halon 1301 and 10 times as much for previously investigated Halon 1301 replacements. These results are ideal for improving existing OPC chemical kinetics mechanisms, and possible applications include both fire suppression technologies and destruction of dangerous OPC compounds. "

In the recent past, cost-driven layout arrangements and the proximity of chemical facilities to densely populated areas, among other factors, have also contributed to the severity and propagation of various chemical incidents. Although several studies have been reported to address such problems, there is still a need for incorporating safety into the facility layout problem (FLP); especially for a method combining quantitative risk assessment (QRA) and layout reformulation. Based on that, the objective of this study is to develop a framework integrating layout formulation with a quantitative risk assessment method to support risk-based decisions throughout the lifecycle of process facilities. The proposed methodology is divided into three steps: risk calculation, determination of safety distances, and layout optimisation. In the first stage, an in-house code has been developed to quantify risks associated with loss of human life and structural damage stochastically. Subsequently, minimum separation distances between process units are obtained to prevent escalation events. In the last stage, risk maps and safety distances are accounted in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for layout optimisation. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study. Sensitivity analysis is performed by varying risk values, safe distances, and risk acceptance criteria. Even though different layout options are generated, a trend is observed towards placing the equipment by its type. "

                    "abstract": "Risk assessment is essential for various purposes such as facility siting, safeguarding, and licensing. Hazard identification (HAZID), which suffers greatly from incompleteness, is still the weakest link in risk assessment. Of course, this recognition is not new and many efforts have been spent to improve the situation, of which some have been rather successful. To find out what can go wrong, creative divergent thinking is required. Hazard identification should result in scenario definition. In that respect, applying the present tools as HAZOP and FMEA there is still a great emphasis on the material and equipment aspects. In contrast, underlying management and leadership failure in its many forms reflecting in organizational and human failure, due to complexity, attracts much less attention. Unlike in HAZID, in accident investigation the occurrence of an event with nasty consequences is no doubt a fact, so there must be one or more causes and the traces will lead to them. Over the years, methods for accident and incident investigation have gone through a significant evolution. From the early-on simplistic domino stone model and the human operator always at fault, via models of latent failure due to failing management involvement and via extensive root cause analysis (RCA) to a system approach. Hence, in accident investigation, management failure appearing in the many possible forms of human and organizational factors, obtained already 30 years ago with the RCA technique much attention, while it nowadays culminates in the socio-technical system approach. So, the question arises whether for improved HAZID we can learn from the accident investigation experience. In addition, safer design and advances from static risk assessment towards more accurate predictive operational dynamic risk assessment and management, will also be enabled by possibilities offered by big data and analytics. Digitization, automation and simulation, hence computerization, will be of great help in improving the identification of hazards and tracing the corresponding scenarios. The paper reviews the developmental history of both accident investigation and hazard identification methodology; incidentally it will identify commonality and differences. On the basis of the comparison and of recent advances in computerization, the paper will investigate to what extent beneficial modifications and additions can be made to obtain a higher degree of completeness in HAZID.

There can be several reasons for this discrepancy: turbulence decays faster in the 20 L vessel compared with the 1 m3 vessel, the energetic ignition sources used in standardized tests may overdrive the combustion process in the 20 L vessel, and the interaction between the flame front, including radiation emitted from the flame, and the vessel walls is more pronounced for the smaller vessel. This paper details an approach for calibrating a new 36 L dust explosion vessel by utilizing principles for factorial design and analyzing the decay of turbulence following the transient dispersion of the dust clouds by means of computation fluid dynamics (CFD). In the present work, the CFD simulations were used to examine transient injection of air into the 20 L and 36 L vessels, in conjunction with experimental data reported for the 20 liter spherical vessel. Although the vessels considered here had slightly different shapes, sizes, dispersion systems and operating conditions, the simulated turbulence levels were similar at the time of explosion. In addition, the estimates for the laminar burning velocity (SL) obtained using experimental results from the 20 L and 36 L vessels, and assuming the validity of a correlation for the turbulent burning velocity (ST), were also in good agreement. The experimental procedure and multi-variable calibration of the 36 L vessel has been successfully validated by comparing the explosion parameters, such as maximum explosion pressure (Pmax) and size-corrected maximum rate of pressure rise (KSt) to values obtained for the same fuels in a standard 20 L vessel. Furthermore, the experimental results obtained for niacin and cornstarch in the 36 L vessel were in excellent agreement with accepted reference values from literature. It is expected that the same methodology can be used for calibrating other equipment with different configurations where transient turbulence decay has a strong effect on the explosions. "

                    "abstract": "Alarm identification refers to selecting a set of measurements to be configured to the alarm system. Contrary to prior literature which uses qualitative cause-effect based techniques, the present work incorporates quantitative aspects such as the time taken by measurements for deviation, to make alarm identification more reliable. The present work proposes a systematic approach to alarm identification through an optimization formulation, as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, for the time. The proposed formulation maximizes the time available for operators to respond to faults while keeping the number of alarms triggered at a minimum. Subsequently, a linear multi-objective optimization formulation reduces the number of optimal solutions taking into account additional criteria, such as order of priority of potential faults. The proposed formulation is applied to the Tennessee Eastman (TE) Challenge problem. A closed-loop simulator was used for fault propagation, to obtain quantitative information required to apply the formulation, and CPLEX solver in GAMS was used to solve this case study problem. "

                    "abstract": "In recent years, the chemical process industry has witnessed increased process safety management challenges. One of the initial steps in process safety and risk management of any facility is hazard identification and analysis. Two types of factors: 1) technical (e.g., equipment malfunction), and 2) social (e.g., human and organizational factors) are important in analyzing hazards of a socio-technical process system as a whole. With the conventional process hazard analysis (PHA) methods, there is a tendency to overlook the potential impact of socio-technical systems on the health and sustainment of safeguards. This disregard leads to ignoring social factors, such as shift handover communication, downtime, operating and maintenance procedures, and more. This need calls for the development of a holistic and integrated systems framework for hazard analysis. This paper presents a novel hazards analysis approach that incorporates both technical and social factors within a single analysis method called Resilience-based Integrated Process Systems Hazard Analysis (RIPSHA). This approach is based on the following resilience aspects – ‘early detection’, ‘error tolerant design’, ‘plasticity’, and ‘recoverability’. This work establishes and presents a worksheet for analysis of hazards within process systems. The paper concludes with an example of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) process system to illustrate the key concepts of this integrated approach. "

                    "abstract": "To improve the fundamental understanding of dust dispersion with application to explosion safety, a series of experiments was conducted to elucidate the effect of particle size and size polydispersity on dust-layer dispersion behind moving shock waves. Aluminum samples of various average sizes (D3,2 = 1.7–30.3 μm) with varying polydispersity (σD = 0.93, 1.52, 2.62) were the focus of this study. A 3.2-mm layer of Al dust was subjected to shock Mach numbers ranging from 1.23 to 1.52 in a shock tube. The effect of particle density on the dust-lifting process was also studied by comparing aluminum and limestone powders with similar average sizes. The results of the study confirm that particle size and size polydispersity have significant impacts on dust lifting as smaller particles lift higher and faster for a given shock speed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to measure the effect of size polydispersity in a dust layer in a shock tube. New correlations were developed between the shock strength and the dust entrainment height as a function of time. Correlations were also developed to show the relation between dust entrainment height and particle size polydispersity. In summary, the results herein are in agreement with trends found in our previous work, where there is a linear relationship between dust-layer height growth rate and shock Mach number, and with the increase of particle size the dust entrainment height decreases. New data were collected for image analyses, where the longer observation time and higher camera framing rates led to the observation of a clear transition time between the early, linear growth regime of the dust-layer height and a much-slower average growth regime to follow. The dust particle size and polydispersity affected both the growth rate of the dust layer (i.e., the change of dust-layer height with time) and the transition times between the two growth regimes. "

                    "abstract": "Risk management challenges and continuous increase of global public aversion to hazards and risks associated with the process industry have been observed in the recent years. In order to manage process industry risk, several studies and methods have been developed and are currently used. The authors believe that two types of interacting factors: 1) technical (equipment malfunction, process parameter variation), and 2) social (regulations/policy, human and organizational factors) are important in assessment of risk for a process system. However, current methods are based on analysis of either technical factors, often quantitatively, or social factors, usually qualitatively. Apart from failure to establish all critical scenarios due to either factors, their combined and interactive effects are seldom considered. This research need calls for the development of a holistic and integrated systems framework for effective risk management, although full coverage of possible mishaps will be utopian. The application of the resilience engineering perspective is gradually being explored as an approach for considering the dynamics of socio-technical aspects based on systems theory to provide a safety net. This paper presents a novel framework - Process Resilience Analysis Framework (PRAF) for incorporating both technical and social factors in an integrated approach. This is based on four aspects: Early Detection (ED), Error Tolerant Design (ETD), Plasticity (P) and Recoverability (R). The resilience methodology emphasizes dynamics, unforeseen and even unknown types of threats, uncertainty, systems degradation and complex interactions. With resilience metrics a combined framework for predictability, survivability and recoverability, all via dynamic analysis, is introduced. PRAF primarily focuses on early detection of unsafe domains of operation, assessment of aggregate risks and prioritization of safety barriers during process upset situations and reduction in response time resulting in a reduced frequency of loss of containment events (LoC), reduced consequences and enhanced recovery. The paper describes the concepts and principles of the PRAF as a first step. "

However, failure to adhere to procedures has resulted in major incidents. While there have been multiple studies investigating procedures in the aviation and nuclear industries, a comprehensive study of the high-risk industries’ use of written procedures is largely absent. This paper documents one part of a large-scale project that addresses this gap by investigating the issues with procedure forms, usage, adoption, and challenges in a wide range of high-risk industries. A grounded theory approach in qualitative data analysis was used to examine 72 interviews with operators of varying roles and experiences across 6 countries and an offshore drilling vessel. Findings reaffirm previous research, suggesting an explanation for the lack of use of procedures due to the abundance of outdated procedures and procedures plagued by information overload. New findings suggest that frequency of the task and the experience level of the worker would impact workers’ procedure use. Other unintended consequences associated with written procedural systems included reactive organizational behavior surrounding procedures and a general disconnect between the users and the writers of these documents.

                    "abstract": "On June 5, 2017, there was a Vapor Cloud Explosion (VCE) at JinYu Petrochemical Co. Ltd. During unloading of liquified natural gas, the gas leaked from the truck and formed a vapor cloud, then the vapor cloud met with the electrical sparks in the plant laboratory, and an explosion occurred. This incident caused significant casualties and property loss. The main causes of the accident are demonstrated by a fishbone diagram. The major causes include (a) defective design, (b) noncompliance with standard operation procedures (SOPs), (c) the presence of ignition sources, (d) ineffective enforcement of safety rules, (e) inadequate design of emergency facilities, and (f) delayed emergency response. The analysis reveals that process safety management (PSM) is a crucial factor in the success of chemical plants, especially for small and median-scale companies in developing countries. Dispersion phenomenon of liquefied gas is simulated by commercial Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) software. The simulation results approximately agree with the real incident. The simulation indicates that a visual and quantitative consequence analysis can provide general guidance for PSM. Finally, based on various PSM conditions (good, normal, weak, and bad), the probabilities of VCE generated from leakage are obtained by an event sequence diagram (ESD) and Monte Carlo methodology. By comparing the quantitative probability values in four different PSM situations, the results show that emergency management associated with effective PSM is crucial to avoid VCE incidents. "

First, current SMSs in the United States, i.e., Process Safety Management (PSM), and Safety and Environment Management Systems (SEMS) were studied to determine if they can be directly extended. According to analysis of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) incident data, development of a new SMS is a better solution rather than extension of the two SMSs. A new SMS has been proposed by identifying and categorizing causal factors of incidents. The SMS has been developed to integrate both process and personnel safety and was designed right for Texas drilling and servicing operations.

Alarms are used to inform the operator about possible process deviations from the normal so that the operator can take appropriate corrective action. Alarm activation and the corresponding response from the operator together serve as one of the critical layers of protection during the occurrence of a process fault. With the rapid advancement in control systems technology over the past few decades, the number of process sensors deployed for a particular plant has dramatically increased. In addition, due to the ease in configuring the alarms in control systems, the number of alarms in a plant has also gone up. This has led to poor system performance, increase in the operator workload due to alarm overload, and catastrophic incidents in some cases. This review paper discusses such issues, provides details about the existing regulations, standards and guidelines, and challenges related to alarm management.

Detailed causal trees of the key state variables (risk perception, risk perspective, risk response, and risk communication) were illustrated and applied to a quantitative simulation using Vensim software. The simulation results reflect the dynamic process of risk perception of lay people, and specific curves of the key state variables were explained to support the rationality of the models. A sensitivity analysis among the state variables and some auxiliary variables were implemented to identify their internal relationships. The proposed methodology quantifies the diversification of psychological activities of risk perception through the simulated data and images, and offers a tool to optimize risk management and the emergency rescue of lay people at risk of a chemical incident.

However, the numerical number resulting in the QRA tells nothing about the ability for systems’ recovery if an upset related to safety occurs in the process. Hence a resilience study is required to produce this additional information related to process safety. The resilience index can thus be defined as the proportion of success in recovering the system compared to a number of safety-related upsets. The failure in recovering strongly depends on type and quality of safety barriers, i.e. technology, but also on organizational principles. In this work, a resilience index is proposed to cope with the missing information to characterize safety in a process system. A strategy based on Monte Carlo simulation is proposed and carried out to quantitatively estimate the resilience index for safely protected systems. These results provide means to compare processes from a more general safety point of view. "

It is plagued by mistrust due in part because estimated uncertainties are generally not included. QRA is done for predictive purpose, to design risk reducing measures, and to base safety decisions on, but many major accidents occur according to scenarios not foreseen in the analysis. Yet, QRA forces us to think. Predicting what can happen under specified conditions is the most elementary step in better safety. So, we must improve the methods and in particular to model sensitive uncertainties and establish confidence limits about our predictions. The present paper will review in short the state of affairs, and it will summarize recent contributions shedding light of what is currently wrong with QRA. The paper will further present for the various aspects and steps to be done in a QRA directions, in which progress is being made and where promising possibilities may appear. The latter are according to the opinion and the scope of the authors, so hopefully there is much more! Anyhow, due to complexities of socio-technical systems a QRA will require more effort, so to keep it practical large scale application of computerization will be a must. And, to improve trust in QRA we must acknowledge variability and quantify the uncertainties as we see them; in addition, there will be hidden uncertainties, which gives reason to think in resilience terms too.

The aqueous hydrogen peroxide used to oxidize the alkylpyridine has a tendency to decompose during the reaction thereby introducing serious hazards for the process. The decomposition is accelerated during the N-oxidation of higher order alkylpyridines (lutidines, collidines) due to mass transfer limitations caused by the separation of the liquid into organic and aqueous phase. Also, the presence of phosphotungstic acid (catalyst) in the aqueous phase further intensifies the peroxide decomposition reducing the safety and efficiency of the process. The current work investigates the influence of the product N-oxide on the mixing between alkylpyridine and water, which is primarily responsible for the liquid phase heterogeneity during the N-oxidation. Ternary mixtures of 2,6-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine N-oxide and water were analyzed at 110 °C to determine phase separation compositions. It was found that extent of heterogeneity between 2,6-lutidine and water is reduced dramatically by the presence of 2,6-lutidine-N-oxide as indicated by the phase diagram. The results could be used to implement the inherent safety concept – “hybridization” to the N-oxidation system wherein the concentration of product N-oxide can be controlled to maintain a less hazardous environment.

This paper introduces the application of fire retardant nanofillers for enhanced flame retardancy as a potential remedy for flame spread. The paper also investigates changes in mechanical properties as a result of nanofiller addition. For this purpose, neat polystyrene (PS), PS-silica and PS-montmorillonite (MMT) have been prepared via in-situ polymerization method. The thermal degradation mechanism of the neat polymer and polymer nanocomposites and the effect of nanoparticle loading on thermal properties have been investigated using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) equipment. TGA and corresponding Derivative TG (DTG) results show that there has been improvement in thermal stability for the nanocomposites. PS-1 wt% silica and PS-3 wt% silica nanocomposites have shown approximately 23% and 15% reduction of Peak Mass Loss Rate (PMLR) respectively. The polymer nanocomposites also showed 72–87% more char yield with respect to neat PS. The glass transition temperature (Tg) as measured by the DSC was comparable to those obtained by the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and the greatest agglomeration was observed for PS-3 wt% MMT. According to the nanoindentation results, there was reduction in hardness of the nanocomposites compared to the neat polystyrene. It was concluded that the addition of nanosilica and nanoclay in small loading can significantly improve thermal stability and mechanical properties; however, higher loading may result in agglomeration and reduction in hardness.

                    "abstract": "Since the Seveso disaster 40 years ago, risk management methods as well as challenges to the process industry have increased along with changes in the public's risk perception globally. The Seveso incident brought to attention some critical issues, such as lack of knowledge on runaway reaction scenarios, hazards of formation of dioxins, lack of regulatory requirements, poor communication and coordination, and little or no emergency response or evacuation plans. Regulations related to process safety and risk management have evolved with time as compared to earlier when there were no specific regulations for controls of such major hazards as became evident during the Seveso incident. Meanwhile, the third improved version of the EU Directive inspired by the incident has been implemented. Although in general over the years occupational safety has vastly improved, major losses have still occurred and in fact formed the motivation to issue the new versions of the Directive. This paper highlights two limitations of the Seveso III Directive – lack of implementation of leading indicators and limited application of hazard and risk identification (for example little or no consideration of the hazards of intermediate products). Some existing gaps like lack of learning from previous incidents, scale-up issues, limitations of experiments related to real scenarios (e.g., vapour cloud explosion), uncertainties involved in complex systems and their gradual degradation by their use are described. These gaps necessitate developing and using advanced methods and an holistic approach such as resilience and advanced mathematic-statistical methods to resolve these issues. This work presents a resilience-based analysis of the Seveso incident and lays the foundation for development of a Process Resilience Analysis Framework. Implementation of this framework would advance current risk assessment and management techniques through integration of technical and social factors.

                    "abstract": "Hazard identification is the first and most crucial step in any risk assessment. Since the late 1960s it has been done in a systematic manner using hazard and operability studies (HAZOP) and failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). In the area of process safety these methods have been successful in that they have gained global recognition. There still remain numerous and significant challenges when using these methodologies. These relate to the quality of human imagination in eliciting failure events and subsequent causal pathways, the breadth and depth of outcomes, application across operational modes, the repetitive nature of the methods and the substantial effort expended in performing this important step within risk management practice. The present article summarizes the attempts and actual successes that have been made over the last 30 years to deal with many of these challenges. It analyzes what should be done in the case of a full systems approach and describes promising developments in that direction. It shows two examples of how applying experience and historical data with Bayesian network, HAZOP and FMEA can help in addressing issues in operational risk management. "

The experimental part involves flow of LNG in a narrow trench filled with water and subsequent measurement of pool spreading and vaporization parameters. The numerical part involves CFD simulation using a three dimensional hybrid homogenous Eulerian multiphase solver to model the pool spreading and vaporization phenomenon. In this method, LNG is modeled as dispersed phase droplets which can interact with continuous phases − water and air through interphase models. The numerical study also employs a novel user-defined routine for capturing the LNG vaporization process. The CFD solver was capable of capturing the salient features of LNG pool spreading and vaporization phenomena. It was observed from experiment and CFD simulation that wind influenced both pool spreading and vaporization phenomenon through entrainment and convection. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a practical oil-spill risk assessment method. The basis of this method is constituted by modeling the physical fluid-flow phenomenon from the reservoir to discharge point and accounting for distribution of uncertainties of various independent variables. Our model couples the gas/oil two-phase flow in a wellbore with a reservoir in deepwater settings. Unsteady-state reservoir depletion coupled with changes in flow patterns in the wellbore are implicit in this analytical modeling approach. We validated the model with various published results related to Gulf of Mexico's Macondo oil spill in a probabilistic frame. Overall, combining the physical model with distributions of uncertain parameters enabled us to depict the risk picture of the uncontrolled wellbore flow events. This approach led to volumetric estimation of the spilled volume. The statistical design of experiments aided in the analysis of the discharged volume range assessed by others in the Macondo case study. The results suggest that good agreement is in hand when compared with the previous deterministic solutions. "

                    "abstract": "Process safety starts at the conceptual phase and continues throughout the entire life cycle of an asset. From process selection to de-commissioning, various process safety elements govern the safety and reliability of the total system. Contractors play a crucial role in project execution including detailed design, technology selection, plant layout, commissioning, start-up, and further expansion, modification and maintenance activities. The interface/interaction of the contractor with the operator/owner often defines the importance of process safety throughout this life cycle. Undoubtedly, these are the most critical phases of a plant life cycle which could trigger an unexpected or uncontrolled situation leading to a catastrophic incident. This paper discusses the impact of the contractors’ role during major process safety events including the Phillips explosion in Pasadena (1989), Sonat vessel failure (1998), Texas City Refinery explosion (2005), T2 Laboratories explosion (2007) and a few others. Lessons from past incidents are highlighted and an in-depth analysis is conducted to identify essential process safety components for different groups of contractors and for the different phases of projects. Different aspects of process safety functional elements are presented and discussed for both greenfield and brownfield projects. A Comprehensive understanding of process safety and risk management is required by all levels of contractors to ensure risk-based decision making and hazard mitigation. Besides the process safety expertise needed by the contractors, the necessity of having a consistent and harmonized interaction between the operators/owners and the contractors is also emphasized. "

                    "abstract": "After the restriction on several ozone-depleting compounds, including the high efficiency fire suppressant Halon 1301(CF3Br), several alternatives have been proposed. Among them, HFC-227-(C3HF7) and HFC-125 (C2HF5) represent two of the most-used fire suppressants in the industry because of their environmentally favorable properties. Due to their increasing demand, it is very important to understand their combustion properties to optimize their applications and to prevent undesirable events. To this end, the present work examined the effect of C2HF5 and C3HF7 on CH4 and C3H8 laminar flame speeds and ignition delay times. The experimental techniques included freely propagating flames to obtain un-stretched, laminar flame speed and a shock tube for the ignition delay times in fuel-O2-suppressant mixtures highly diluted in Ar (∼98%) using OH* emission near 307 nm. The laminar flame speed experiments were performed at 1 atm over a range of equivalence ratios from 0.7 to 1.3, and the shock-tube tests were done near 1.5 atm over a 1350–2200 K temperature range. A chemical kinetics mechanism was assembled using a HFC set of reactions together with a recently updated C0-C5 hydrocarbon mechanism and OH* chemistry. The results suggest that the tested agents may not be good alternatives as ignition preventers, although they can reduce the laminar flame speed, as a proof that they can be used as fire extinguishers. Comparisons between modeled and experimental data show that the HFC sub-mechanism behaves well, however it can be improved. Surprisingly, a sensitivity analysis shows that many of the top reactions containing fluorinated compounds are classified as ignition-promoters, especially for the experiments with CH4. This work presents some of the first fundamental ignition delay time and flame speed data for HFC-227 and -125, and the results can be used as the basis for future HFC-based chemical kinetics mechanism improvements and to further understand their impact on the combustion process.

                    "abstract": "The oil and gas extraction (OGE) industry continues to experience an elevated fatality rate; OGE workers are exposed to intensive shift patterns and long work durations inherent in the OGE environment, which can lead to fatigue, thereby increasing risks of incidents and injuries. As such, fatigue assessment methods play a critical role in identifying and subsequently managing fatigue in offshore operators. The aims of this observational study were to explore the effect of offshore shiftwork on physiological and subjective fatigue outcomes. Ten male operators (age: 31.3 (6.1) years; stature: 1.72 (0.1) m; weight: 85.24 (9.8) kg) were monitored throughout their daily shifts for six days on an offshore drillship using intrinsically safer physiological sensors that recorded various physiological parameters. Additionally, existing subjective fatigue scales from the literature were employed to obtain perceptions of fatigue. Six of the ten operators underwent swing shift in the middle of the data collection period. Physiological results indicate that overall average heart rate (an indicator of fatigue) were elevated for all operators and remained elevated for those who started and ended their work on the day shift. Operators' subjective reports of fatigue were relatively high for acute fatigue and intershift recovery as well as for lack of effort and sleepiness; however, the physiological measures were not consistently correlated with the subjective measures of fatigue. The study outcomes identified a critical gap in fatigue assessment in OGE operations; existing fatigue surveys for the general (or other) working populations are not comprehensive of OGE operations and are thus not applicable for OGE workers, nor are they validated against physiological fatigue outcomes in OGE workers.

                    "abstract": "In the wake of the August 2012 fire at the Chevron refinery in Richmond, California, the United States (US) Chemical Safety Board proposed the safety case regulatory approach as an alternative to the current approach used in the US today. The current regulations known as the Process Safety Management (PSM) regulations were promulgated in 1992. This followed several highly publicized catastrophic incidents (e.g., Phillips 66 Pasadena, Texas polyethylene plant explosion, 1989; Piper Alpha, North Sea, 1988 and Bhopal, India, 1984). The US approach to regulation is best described as a combination of prescriptive and performance-based regulations that address safety considerations in design and operations. A safety case approach, as used in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Norway, requires a detailed analysis of hazards and steps taken to address those hazards, and thus minimize or mitigate the risk. Both the safety case and PSM processes address many of the same aspects such as management of change, identification of hazards and assessment of risks, but the process and format for documentation and regulatory review differs. The question then arises as to the effectiveness of these two regulatory regimes in preventing process safety related incidents. Many reputable organizations and research groups have taken positions regarding whether the US should abandon the existing system of safety regulations. Review of several global incidents has shown that while appropriate hazards and risks were identified, operational shortcomings led to incidents. Uniform and consistent process safety data are in the early stages of being collected and published by such organizations as the American Petroleum Institute (API) and The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (OGP), using API RP 754 defined metrics. For this paper, data have been collected on oil and gas operations in the US, UK, Norway and Australia to compare the performance of the differing regulatory regimes. While the data are not comprehensive, from existing data on major incidents, spills and fatalities, one cannot conclude that one regulatory regime is superior to the other. Consistent reporting of incidents in a database with appropriate metrics is sorely needed. Furthermore, the authors express the need to move beyond regulatory compliance and suggest research on application of a systems approach to process safety by developing a process resilience analysis framework for process design and operations.

                    "abstract": "Risk communication is an effective way to understand, assess and manage risk of chemical industrial parks, a process which requires the involvement of stakeholders. However, different risk perceptions may cause sorts of barriers formed in risk communication, sometimes resulting in mass confrontation incidents. Enterprise decision-makers play a key role in this process and further risk decision-making. To study the changes of risk perception of enterprise decision-maker in the face of incidents in chemical industry parks, two main dynamic sequence “risk perception – risk perspective – risk response – risk communication – risk perception” and “Risk perception → Real-time risk information →Safety education →Risk experience → Risk perception” are adopted to form causality feedback loops based on system dynamics theory. System dynamics models are established to interpret the mechanism of subjective process and achieve quantitative simulation value of key state variables of risk perception, risk perspective, risk communication and risk response. Through explanation and sensitive analysis of simulation results, some relationships among state variables of risk perception, risk perspective, risk communication and risk response are obtained to prove the rationality of models. The results show that the diversification of psychological activities can be reflected by the simulated data and images, which has practical significance for decision-making among different groups of people.

                    "abstract": "Offshore operations have always been very challenging due to technological and operational complexities in combination with harsh environmental conditions. Geological uncertainties, high pressure flammable fluids in the presence of ignition sources, complicated structural layouts, limited response time allowance, difficulty of control and communication are some of the critical factors that pose clear threats toward safe operations and may result in high consequence events, e.g., blowouts. Developing well specified risk indicators is difficult due to such highly correlated factors and multifaceted operations. Leading indicators, which are able to identify critical events that could lead to high consequence events, have proven to be an effective tool that can help the operators in their decision making to react earlier to an event and to reduce the risk of an incident. Most of the research dedicated to leading and lagging indicators are applicable to the petrochemical industry, and there is not yet an agreement on a definition and classification of leading indicators for drilling related blowouts. This paper discusses the approaches of different organizations and institutes on leading indicators characterization and development. The drilling industry is compared with the aviation industry to identify potential elements for developing a comprehensive leading indicators framework. A workable definition of leading indicators is proposed considering the intricacy of offshore operations. Leading indicators are broadly categorized into two classes which are further segmented into different groups. Proposed categorization is analyzed with a blowout case study and simple decision support algorithms are proposed for predicting kick which is a major precursor to blowouts. "

The same three nanofillers were also embedded into PMMA without TMPTA cross-linkages to quantify the effect of TMPTA cross-linkages on the thermal stability and char yield of nanocomposites. Data from Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Derivative Thermogravimetric Analysis (DTG) were used to show that cross-linking and nanofiller content act synergistically to improve the thermal stability of PMMA, increasing the on-set of degradation by nearly 100 °C. The increase in thermal stability was attributed to the elimination of low temperature end initiated polymer unzipping by TMPTA cross-linkages and simultaneous stabilization of remaining degradation reactions due to nanofiller content. Char formed during a fire accumulates on the surface of the nanocomposite, forming a barrier that protects any unburned material below the surface. The DTG data showed nanocomposites containing 1 wt% silica in PMMA cross-linked by TMPTA produced 14.1% char residues, while nanocomposites without TMPTA cross-linkages required five times the mass of nanofiller to achieve similar yields.

There have been several thermal runaway accidents related to this hazardous compound. It is well known that heat of formation is one of the most important parameters to investigate thermal runaway reactions. The heat of formation for the endo isomer has been characterized via computational and experimental studies. However, there is no thorough computational or experimental study on the heat of formation for the exo isomer. In this work, computational chemistry methods with homodesmotic reaction schemes were proposed to predict the heat of formation for the exo isomer. First, the computational methodology was validated by comparing predicted results of the endo isomer with its existing experimental value (42.2 ± 0.6 kcal/mol). The results from high level ab-initio, density functional theory, and composite methods were shown in a good agreement with the experimental value. The same methodology was then applied to predict the heat of formation for the exo isomer. The energy difference of heat of formation between two isomers was estimated at 0.7 ± 0.1 kcal/mol based on various computational methods. Therefore, combining the experimental and computational data, the predicted heat of formation for the exo isomer is 41.5 ± 0.6 kcal/mol.

After the BP Deepwater Horizon accident, several investigation committees recommended to reexamine the United States' existing regulatory approaches by integrating more sophisticated risk assessment and risk management practices. It has been observed that this type of reactive changes in regulation sometimes give more focus on the causes of a particular accident rather than considering possible future hazards unrelated to that particular accident. There are primarily two approaches of the offshore oil/gas industry's regulatory regime; while the United States' regulatory system is the more prescriptive-based, the United Kingdom's approach is performance-based. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling Accident recommended changing U.S. regulatory regime to a proactive, risk-based approach which could be similar to the “Safety Case” approach of the North Sea. The “Safety Case” approach of the U.K. is considered successful in minimizing accidents in the North Sea region. The objective of this study is to perform an evaluation and comparison between the United States' prescriptive-based regulatory approaches and the United Kingdom's performance-based regulatory approaches to understand their advantages and disadvantages. Then, this study presents an analysis of major accident histories under both regulatory regimes and discusses their effectiveness in reducing accidents. The study has found that there are both advantages and disadvantages in both the regulatory regimes and with available data, it is difficult to conclude with certainty that one regulatory regime is better than the other.

This paper presents CFD simulations of cryogenic film boiling for liquid nitrogen (LN2) and LNG as pure methane. Different aspects of CFD modeling such as vapor-liquid interface morphology, the behavior of heat flux at the heated surface, the effect of wall superheats on bubbles generation frequency and bubbles departure diameter are presented. Based on the results of CFD simulations, a first principle model is applied to correlate the wall heat flux in the film boiling regime.

During the analysis, it was observed that 60% of the incidents resulted in explosions and 16% had equipment malfunction as a proximate cause. In addition, the analysis using the risk-based framework showed that incidents were influenced by a deficiency of safe work practices, operating procedures and conduct of operations.

                    "abstract": "Well-written procedures are an integral part of any industrial organization for safe operation, managing risks, and continuous improvement. Regulatory bodies around the world require industries to have current, accurate, and appropriate procedures for most processes. Although the importance of procedures is recognized by all industries in general, significant incidents still occur due to procedural breakdowns. Some of the procedural breakdowns come from obvious problems such as the procedure not being available or the procedure being wrong. However, some incidents have occurred when correct procedures were available and the operator used those procedures. In these instances, the reason workers do not follow procedures correctly may be attributable the procedure being presented or designed in a manner that does not sufficiently communicate the information in a manner that is easily and quickly understood. This indicates that procedure writers may need more guidance on how to write and design procedures so they accomplish this. To effectively manage risk, procedures need to be technically correct (and regulatory compliant) and usable. As part of this, the current work is focused on developing a systematic approach to a procedure writer's guide that includes a regulatory compliant component. The work presented here consists of an effort to identify procedure-writing practices necessary to ensure regulatory compliance by summarizing a large sample of regulations and standards from several industries. The regulations and standards were organized to reflect common ideas and the implications in terms of human factors needs for procedure design were identified. This information will be used as part of the development of a writer's guide that accounts for human factors (HF) that includes explanations of HF implications and empirical support for each of the guidelines. The novelty of the method and information presented here is in the idea of leveraging the cumulative information available regarding procedures in regulations and standards. Incorporating this information into a procedure's writers guide in this manner may not only facilitate procedure being regulatory compliant for facilities in different geographies of the world, but could also support their being written with considerations for human performance.

Current efforts are being observed on the application of such types of metrics as part of the design of a process. This application focuses on the synthesis of inherently safer designs.

In this paper a review on the development of safety indices, with particular emphasis on their application for process design, is presented. The type of information and the output one obtains from the application of such indices is described. Some examples of recent applications that include safety as part of the design of several chemical processes are given. "

Gas release effects are typically assessed based on calculating the dispersion from releasing points. In this work, a CFD-based approach is proposed to estimate gas dispersion and then to obtain optimal gas sensors allocation. The Ansys-Fluent commercial package is used to estimate concentrations in the open air by solving the governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy and species convection-diffusion combined with the realizable κ-ε model for turbulence viscosity effects. CFD dynamic simulations are carried out for potential gas leaks, assuming worst-case scenarios with F-stability and 2 m/s wind speed during a 4 min releasing period and considering 8 wind directions. The result is a scenario-based methodology to allocate gas sensors supported on fluid dynamics models. The three x–y–z geographical coordinates for the sensor allocation are included in this analysis. To highlight the methodology, a case study considers releases from a large container surrounded by different types of geometric units including sections with high obstacles, low obstacles, and no obstacles. A non-redundant set of perfect sensors are firstly allocated to cover completely the detection for all simulations releases. The benefits of redundant detection via a MooN voting arranging scheme is also discussed. Numerical results demonstrate the capabilities of CFD simulations for this application and highlight the dispersion effects through obstacles with different sizes. "

                    "abstract": "Secondary dust explosions in coal mines or industrial settings are known to cause greater catastrophic hazards than the coupled primary explosions themselves. The shock waves produced during a primary explosion lift surrounding coal particles from neighboring areas, and if added in an effort to create an inert mixture, limestone as well. This experimental study characterized the coupled effects of dust dispersion from coal-limestone mixtures and moisture-varied limestone dust. A shock tube modified to evaluate dust dispersion provided the optical access to characterize the shock wave/dust-layer interaction. The moisture-varied limestone samples were tested at three shock Mach numbers, namely Ms = 1.1, 1.23, and 1.4, with trending data showing an average increase of 10% in overall lifting heights and 20% in initial linear growth rates for the moisture-reduced, dried samples, as compared to undried samples stored in standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions. The coal-limestone mixture samples were tested at two shock Mach numbers, namely Ms = 1.24 and 1.57, with the 75% limestone sample having the highest and the 25% limestone sample having the lowest effective dust dispersion effects. Conceivably, the effective moisture reduction in the samples led to fewer agglomerations and/or reduced densities, influencing the ability of lift forces to act on the particles, while as the limestone content was increased in coal-limestone mixtures, dust layers grew faster, larger, and transitioned into more pronounced instabilities on the dust-gas boundaries. The combined effects of dispersion, SEM imagery, and the study of test facility shadowgraphs lead to recommending the ignition-inhibiting coal-limestone mixture containing 50% limestone. The dust-layer rise height was measured with respect to time after the shock passage, where regardless of mixture-ratio or moisture content in the samples, initial linear dust growth rates increased with shock Mach number. Linear and unstable regimes were also identified in the data samples, as seen in previous studies by the authors. "

Lower and upper flammability limits of hydrocarbon mixtures in air with additional nitrogen were measured in this research. Typically, fuel mixture lower flammability limits almost keep constant at different fractions of added nitrogen; and approximately upper flammability limits of fuel mixture vary linearly with the addition of nitrogen except those mixtures containing ethylene. Numerical analysis of effect from inert gas dilution on fuel mixture lower and upper flammability limits was conducted by introducing the parameter of inert gas dilution coefficient, through which fuel mixture flammability properties, e.g., lower flammability limit, upper flammability limit, and minimum inerting concentration, can be quantitatively characterized with the modified Le Chatelier’s mixing rule.

                    "abstract": "Layer of protection analysis (LOPA) is a widely used semi-quantitative risk assessment method. It provides a simplified and less precise method to assess the effectiveness of protection layers and the residual risk of an incident scenario. The outcome failure frequency and consequence of that residual risk are intended to be conservative by prudently selecting input data, given that design specification and component manufacturer's data are often overly optimistic. There are many influencing factors, including design deficiencies, lack of layer independence, availability, human factors, wear by testing and maintenance shortcomings, which are not quantified and are dependent on type of process and location. This makes the risk in LOPA usually overestimated. Therefore, to make decisions for a cost-effective system, different sources and types of uncertainty in the LOPA model need to be identified and quantified. In this study, a fuzzy logic and probabilistic hybrid approach was developed to determine the mean and to quantify the uncertainty of frequency of an initiating event and the probabilities of failure on demand (PFD) of independent protection layers (IPLs). It is based on the available data and expert judgment. The method was applied to a distillation system with a capacity to distill 40 tons of flammable n-hexane. The outcome risk of the new method has been proven to be more precise compared to results from the conventional LOPA approach. "

                    "abstract": "The release of hazardous chemicals poses a threat to individuals in the area of a release and to responders who attempt to limit the damage of the release. For a liquid phase spill, the most common decontamination technology is a sodium hypochlorite and water solution. Although this solution has been proven effective against a variety of contaminants, it also has a host of drawbacks. Novel decontamination technologies have been developed for military applications, however, they have not been explored with the same depth in the industrial sector. Therefore, there is a need for an industrial decontamination technology that is noncorrosive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and environmentally safe. Decontamination solutions and foams have the potential to improve hazardous chemical spill cleanup, saving time, money, and lives. This work uses a derivative of cysteine, called N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-L-cysteine methyl ester (TCME), as a surrogate for non-polar hazardous industrial bio-chemicals. Previous work has been done to compare the effect of decontamination foam against other decontamination solutions, however in the work the contaminants were typically polar, thus easily able to dissolve in the foam and react rapidly. In this work, the effect of less polar contaminants is studied, introducing transport limitations as well as reaction limitations. Additionally, this work examines the effect of surfactant on decontamination reactions by using water based decontamination solution and decontamination foam as decon technologies. All experiments were conducted in the liquid phase and results were analyzed using GC-MS to determine the extent of reaction. "

                    "abstract": "Despite the implementation of multiple sophisticated safety barriers, well blowout, the most undesired disaster for the petroleum industry, still happens as Macondo or Montara incidents show. The crush of crude price has pushed the operators toward cost-cutting plans. Such plans, in short terms, may significantly reduce the exploration and operation costs and relieve financial pressures. On the other hand, such measures may also compromise the balance among safety, reliability and cost in the long term and potentially lead to catastrophic accidents. The current regulation in the Gulf of Mexico region requires the operators to report a single value for the worst-case discharge (WCD) during a possible blowout. However, it does not provide any additional value to manage risk of uncontrolled wellbore flow event and the impact to the marine environment. In this paper, a practical and comprehensive oil spill risk assessment method is introduced. It couples the reservoir/wellbore models and distribution of uncertainties to depict the risk picture of uncontrolled wellbore flow events. Statistical design of experiments is conducted to determine important uncertainties to the blowout risk. As shown by sensitivity analysis, this method can guide the operators to allocate limited resources to the important barriers and make proper risk reduction plans, so that the blowout risks are effectively controlled.

The numerical results obtained from image processing were used to determine turbulence parameters like turbulent intensity, turbulent kinetic energy and eddy dissipation rate. An interesting aspect of the study was the formation of wavy structures called ‘thermals’ which were characteristic of turbulent convection. The thermals were found to act as a catalyst in increasing heat transfer and turbulence between water and cryogenic pool. The turbulent intensity was influenced by the turbulent velocity and had direct effects on the vaporization flux. Among the turbulence parameters, increase in turbulent kinetic energy resulted in faster vaporization of cryogenic liquid through enhanced mixing, whereas variations in the eddy dissipation rate had weak dependence on vaporization. Additionally, the initial height of cryogenic liquid was also found to strongly affect the vaporization mass flux. "

This has justifiably led to many focusing on procedure presentation, design, and accuracy. At the same time there is some discussion a-foot that there may be an over-reliance on procedures and too little analysis of the entire human system integration and human machine interface. Based on insights from observations of and interviews with workers in industrial settings doing procedures, applications of two standard Human Factors methods (user testing and task analysis) are applied to three typical reason that operators do not adhere to procedures. The analyses presented here illustrate that the basic method of user testing (field validation for this paradigm) can be leveraged to decrease the likelihood of mismatches between the standardized procedure and the methods used in the field as well as the methods used for on the job training. Further, task analyses can be used to identify what type of supports (e.g., check lists, in hand written procedures) will best support human performance for performing different types of tasks given the frequency that these tasks are performed. The chief usefulness of the information available in these discussions is in the application of basic Human Factors methods to a problematic domain for many industries—procedure adherence. By using methods designed to identify and accommodate the capabilities and constraints of the human, the quality and adherence of standardized procedures can be improved. Moreover, the results of this work can serve as a springboard for more exploring more productive operational safeguards that properly account for missteps and errors that sometimes lead to hazardous situations.

                    "abstract": "The oil/gas, chemical, petrochemical, food, power, papermaking and other process industries consist of numerous equipment and unit operations, thousands of control loops, and exhibit dynamic behavior. Chemical process plants are subjected to different types of process risks in daily operations, which include risks due to reactivity, toxicity and mechanical hazards, fire and explosion risks etc. Failure to manage or minimize hazards can result in serious incidents. Therefore, it is very important to identify hazards, perform risk assessments, and take proper initiatives to minimize/remove hazards and risks; else a catastrophic accident may result. Dynamic characteristics such as stochastic processes, operator response times, inspection and testing time intervals, ageing of equipment/components, season changes, sequential dependencies of equipment/components and timing of safety system operation also have great influence on the dynamic processes. Conventional risk assessment methodologies generally used in oil/gas and petrochemical plants have limited capacity in quantifying these time dependent characteristics. Therefore, it is important to develop a method that can address time-dependent effects in risk calculation and provide precise estimation. This study proposes a risk assessment methodology for dynamic systems based on Bayesian network, which represents the dependencies among variables graphically and captures the changes of variables over time by the dynamic Bayesian network. This study proposes to develop dynamic fault tree for a chemical process system/sub-system. Then a procedure to map the developed dynamic fault tree to map into the Bayesian network and the dynamic Bayesian network is provided to demonstrate the dynamic operational risk assessment methodology. A case study on a level control system is provided to illustrate the methodology's ability in capturing dynamic operational changes in process due to sequential dependency of one equipment/component on others.

However, erosion, corrosion, and other effects may cause a GLV to leak, thereby posing a serious safety issue. Suspected leaking GLVs are often retrieved for inspection to address safety issues. Proactive testing is a way to minimize costly interventions. Accordingly, nonintrusive test procedures have emerged. For example, tests entailing monitoring of annular transient-pressure response can establish a GLV’s integrity by avoiding valve retrieval for inspection. This study details the development of a forward model that helps design methodology for GLV testing. The model recommends drawing down the annular gas to develop a positive pressure differential to allow fluid flow from the tubing into the annulus through the suspected GLV. This drawdown (DD) is followed by a pressure-buildup (BU) test. These pressure-transient tests allow the determination of the integrity and extent of GLV damage. The forward model also allows the estimation of the time needed for each segment of the transient-test sequence, thereby helping to schedule such tests at a certain operational frequency. "

The experimental measurement includes the flame detection using standard CCD camera to capture the details of flame morphology. The frames obtained from CCD camera are reconstructed using image visualization technique to obtain the flame morphology like flame length and lift-off length. The modeling includes comparison of experimentally determined jet flames with empirical correlations. The flame length is well validated with three empirical correlations. The lift-off length is found to be under-predicted by all the models. With extended analysis on image processing, it is observed that lift-off length is sensitive to the threshold intensity value chosen for image processing, whereas, flame length parameter is independent of the threshold intensity value. The deviation between experimental and predicted values is also attributed to soot formation which affects the lift-off lengths and the heat radiated by jet fires. The flame area obtained from image visualization methods are compared to flame area obtained from empirical models. The effect of air entrainment is also studied on flame geometry. It is observed that the horizontal extent of visible flame length is affected by the wind flowing in the downwind direction of jet fire. The vertical extent of the jet fires is found to reduce with wind flowing in the crosswind direction. "

The aerosol was dispersed with a burst of gas and then allowed to settle for at least 45 s, to ensure that the conditions inside the test chamber were quiescent and uniform. Extinction of the light from a HeNe laser was used so that the mass of suspended nano-particles with a fundamental size of 100 nm could be determined as a function of time prior to combustion, and the suspended mass of aluminum (up to 90 mg) was measured in situ during an experiment. A particle size distribution was measured as well, resulting in an average pre-combustion agglomeration size of 446.1 nm. Two series of experiments were performed with CH4 fuel, both at stoichiometric conditions: one with the mixture in air and the second with the mixture in a 70/30 N2/O2 mix. The results herein show a maximum decrease in flame speed, 5–7% for the baseline mixture, when nano-aluminum was introduced at the suspended masses utilized in the present study. For the 70/30 N2/O2 mixture, the aluminum resulted in a maximum decrease of 5 cm/s from the baseline value of 80.5 cm/s; and in the air mixture, a 2 cm/s maximum decrease from 35.3 cm/s was observed. Simple modeling of the process extremes indicates that the observed decrease in flame speed is somewhere between the limits of simple particle heating with no particle reaction and the kinetics limit where the Al reacts in the gas phase. Interestingly, the trends qualitatively matched those of the kinetics model applied herein. It was also found that the addition of nanoparticles caused the flame to become unstable much sooner when compared to the baseline mixture of CH4/air. "

The chosen approach was to obtain reliable thermal decomposition by a safe and effective method, which acquired the kinetic and safety parameters of storage conditions that could be applied as highly exothermic materials' reduction of loss prevention and energy potential for safer design during storage transport and processing operations.

Nicotine exerts its cellular functions by acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and adversely affects normal embryonic development. However, nicotine toxicity has not been elucidated in human embryonic stage. In the present study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of nicotine in human multipotent embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2/D1. We found that exposure to 10 μM nicotine decreased intracellular ATP levels and inhibited proliferation of NT2/D1 cells. Because nicotine suppressed energy production, which is a critical mitochondrial function, we further assessed the effects of nicotine on mitochondrial dynamics. Staining with MitoTracker revealed that 10 μM nicotine induced mitochondrial fragmentation. The levels of the mitochondrial fusion proteins, mitofusins 1 and 2, were also reduced in cells exposed to nicotine. These nicotine effects were blocked by treatment with mecamylamine, a nonselective nAChR antagonist. These data suggest that nicotine degrades mitofusin in NT2/D1 cells and thus induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cell growth inhibition in a nAChR-dependent manner. Thus, mitochondrial function in embryonic cells could be used to assess the developmental toxicity of chemicals. "

One of the most recent incidents occurred on April 17, 2013, where a fire led to an explosion at the West Fertilizer Company in West, Texas, USA. These incidents highlight the dire need for continuous research on AN hazards and alternatives to make its use safer. AN can thermally decompose and further detonate under certain conditions, e.g., in the presence of impurities which act as promoters. However, certain additives can act as inhibitors and reduce the risk of its runaway. The main objective of the research presented here focuses on the synergistic effect of an inhibitor and a promoter on AN decomposition. The Reactive Systems Screening Tool (RSST) has been used in the study of the runaway behavior of AN in the presence of a promoter (KCl) and an inhibitor (Na2SO4), and it is compared with the behavior of AN with each additive separately. It was found that when both additives are mixed, Na2SO4 induces a rise in the decomposition “onset” temperature. The presence of KCl, however, induces a more violent decomposition worsening all other parameters. Potential decomposition mechanisms are also discussed. "

The most common mitigation technique is high-expansion foam which can be used to blanket the liquid, reducing the accumulation of flammable vapor above the pool through a number of different mechanisms. Despite the effectiveness of high-expansion foam blanketing, there are many aspects of the interaction between foam and LNG that are unknown. A lab-scale high-expansion foam generator has been developed to allow the study of those interactions. Additionally, the novel foam generator design addresses many of the drawbacks of industrial-scale foam generators and allows researchers better control of the foam, while producing foam at rates that are conducive to lab applications. Foam was produced using the generator and expansion ratio and foam stability were measured to determine the quality. The generator was able to produce foam with expansion ratio between 298 and 892 that collapsed at an average rate of 0.4 cm per minute. This quality of the foam is comparable to industrial-scale foam generators and the foam production rate is between 1.2 and 2.2 m3/min, which fits lab-scale needs. The foam generator can also be used with other types of non-firefighting foam, such as decontamination foam for chemical, biological, or nuclear decontamination. "

The ethylene industry is one of the main beneficiaries of such growth because of the switch from the conventional naphtha feedstock to shale-gas constituents. Different technologies must be screened and compared. In addition to the typical approach of performing techno-economic analysis for comparing technologies, it is important to consider safety aspects early enough in the selection process. This paper presents a comparative approach for two ethylene-production technologies through techno-economic and safety analysis. The primary process route is a state of art process while other is a novel process that is still in development stage. The conventional process route is ethane steam cracking which is a well-established process. The competing candidate is ECLAIRS (Ethylene from Concentrated Liquid phase Acetylene- Integrated, Rapid and Safe) which is an emerging gas to ethylene process. A top level analysis is performed using key quantitative indicators of process, cost and inherent safety. The results show that the conventional technology of ethane cracking has an attractive process and economic potential while the emerging gas to ethylene technology is inherently safer. The areas of improvement are identified and a critical analysis of metrics is carried out. "

Modeling is needed for a better understanding of the fuel flow and combustion behavior that are essential to enhance fuel quality and improve engine performance. A simplified alternative is to develop surrogate fuels that have fewer compounds and emulate certain important desired physical properties of the target fuels. Six gasoline blends were formulated through a computer aided model based technique “Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming” (MINLP). Different target properties of the surrogate blends for example, Reid vapor pressure (RVP), dynamic viscosity (η), density (ρ), Research octane number (RON) and liquid-liquid miscibility of the surrogate blends) were calculated. In this study, more rigorous property models in a computer aided tool called Virtual Process-Product Design Laboratory (VPPD-Lab) are applied onto the defined compositions of the surrogate gasoline. The aim is to primarily verify the defined composition of gasoline by means of VPPD-Lab. ρ, η and RVP are calculated with more accuracy and constraints such as distillation curve and flash point on the blend design are also considered. A post-design experiment-based verification step is proposed to further improve and fine-tune the “best” selected gasoline blends following the computation work. Here, advanced experimental techniques are used to measure the RVP, ρ, η, RON and distillation temperatures. The experimental results are compared with the model predictions as well as the extended calculations in VPPD-Lab. "

Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) is one such process which uses CO2 and natural gas to produce a valuable intermediate, syngas (mixture of CO and H2). However, to compare DRM with existing reforming technologies (Steam Methane Reforming - SMR and Partial Oxidation of Methane - POx) on an environmental scale, it is important to account for all sources of emissions in each process pathway. This paper discusses an optimization-based approach in LINGO to compare the carbon footprint of different syngas production networks. Reformer outputs have been estimated based on an earlier developed Gibbs energy minimization equilibrium model. The results shows that incorporating a DRM unit will have net CO2 fixation (net reduction in CO2) while producing syngas of low syngas ratios (H2/CO) of 1 and below. However, above syngas ratio of 2, the optimization model does not select DRM in the syngas production network which minimizes overall CO2 emissions. "

                    "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane (DRM) utilizes two greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to produce a syngas mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), which is a very important precursor for the production of a variety of valuable chemicals and liquid fuels. Although DRM offers important advantages for sequestering CO2, its utilization is challenged by certain critical process limitations such as carbon deposition, high energy requirements and low quality of H2:CO ratio. Due to these limitations, DRM process has always been a grey area demanding more research for its successful implementation at an industrial scale. Much of the work recently reported in the literature suggests the utilization of the combination of the conventional reforming technologies like steam reforming (SRM) and partial oxidation (POX) to tackle these limitations. The objective of this work is to develop a process integration approach to the optimization of a process involving DRM, SRM, and POX. As an extension to our previous work involving the optimization of the various operating parameter’s involved in Tri-Reforming (Challiwala et al. 2017), this work is aimed at mass and heat integration of the overall process to determine important benchmarks and to couple the reforming system with the rest of the process. Detailed kinetic and thermodynamic aspects are used to provide a high-fidelity model of the reforming system. The results from the thermodynamic study have been validated by using different combinations of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) based kinetic models pertaining to DRM, POX and SRM processes individually. In particular, the major advancement in this work shows that the combination of individual kinetic models of different systems could be compatible to each other to predict the behaviour of the combined DRM/SRM/POX system and to exploit synergism with mass and energy from the rest of the industrial process. Validation of the results shows excellent agreement between thermodynamic and kinetic product profiles. In addition to this, the combined kinetic model was used to simulate a pseudo-homogeneous fixed bed reformer reactor in MATLAB® and further extended in COMSOL® simulation package to investigate the effect of the transport resistances present in the system under localized conditions of the catalyst bed. The proposed work is carried out at different scales and is conducive to multi-scale system integration and optimization. "

                    "abstract": "Dry reforming of methane is one of the few chemical reactions which can effectively convert carbon dioxide (CO2), a major green-house gas, into a valuable chemical precursor, syngas (a mixture of CO and H2), that can be converted into chemicals and fuels via different synthesis routes such as the Fischer Tropsch synthesis. The inherent limitations of dry reforming reaction, for instance, rapid catalyst deactivation by coke deposition and the very high energy requirements, has restricted its use as a commercial technology. This study was performed to evaluate the potential of overcoming the limitations of dry reforming by integrating it with other commercial methane reforming technologies such as steam reforming and partial oxidation reforming in the context of industrial operating conditions. A thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the combined reforming has been conducted using the software suite MATLAB®. The aim of this complicated assessment is to identify optimized combination of the three reformers and also the corresponding operating conditions that would utilize significant amount of CO2 while ensuring CO2 fixation, minimum carbon formation and optimum energy requirements. The thermodynamic equilibrium product distribution calculations involved the Peng Robinson (PR), Redlich Kwong (RK) and Soave Redlich Kwong (SRK) equations of state (EOS) to identify the best EOS that accounts for the non-ideality associated with the high pressure operation. The study evaluated simultaneous effects of temperature (200 °C–1200 °C), pressure (1–20 bar) and feed mole ratios (of methane, steam, carbon dioxide and oxygen) on the equilibrium product distribution. The addition of oxygen and steam to dry reforming helped in decreasing energy requirements while simultaneously increasing the syngas yield ratio (H2:CO ratio). The numerical evaluation revealed an optimized operating condition of ∼750 °C at 1 bar pressure at a feed mole ratio CH4:H2O:O2:CO2 of 1:0.4:0.3:1. For this optimization, the system boundaries were limited only to a reformer block without considering the upstream and dowstream processes. At this optimized condition, the carbon deposition was eliminated and the CO2 conversion was observed to be 47.84% with an energy requirement of 180.26 kJ. The study is further extended to include kinetic analysis of combined dry and steam reforming of methane. The preliminary findings of kinetic evaluation indicated an excellent agreement between combined kinetic model with the thermodynamic equilibrium results. "

This reaction provides necessary hydrogen for synthesis gas with low H2/CO molar ratio, and has influence on concentrations of reactants, water and carbon dioxide, which in turn has effect on product distribution, rate of FTS and catalyst deactivation. We provide information on the effect of process conditions (H2/CO feed ratio, reaction temperature and pressure), syngas conversion, and catalyst composition and activation procedure on the WGS activity. H2/CO consumption (or usage) ratio and the exit H2/CO ratio vary with conversion and the extent of WGS reaction. The extent of variation is much greater for H2/CO feed ratios greater than 1.7, than it is for the CO rich syngas (H2/CO = 0.5–1). This in turn places limits on maximum practical single pass conversion which can be achieved with different feed compositions and results in different types of operation (low single pass conversion with tail gas recycle, and high once through single pass conversion).

The developed model is capable of predicting the concentration and temperature profiles at the micro-(catalyst pores) level as well as the macro-(reactor bed) level for a cobalt-based catalyst (15 wt% Co/Al2O3). The uniqueness of this model is that it tries to combine different levels of complexity (product distribution modeling, particle diffusion and reactor bed modeling) into one single model. The predictability of this model has been validated experimentally using an advanced high-pressure FTS reactor unit over a wide range of testing conditions. It quite accurately predicts experimentally measured CH4 selectivity at different gas hourly space velocities but less accurately predicted CO conversion. On the other hand, a hydrocarbon product distribution has been predicted using a MATLAB® code that was written to estimate the FTS kinetic model’s parameters (Todic et al., 2013) based on the experimental data collected using bench scale FTS fixed-bed reactor. The optimization of this model was done using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The findings showed excellent predictability of the experimentally measured hydrocarbon product distribution profile of the catalyst, specifically paraffin formation rates which are the main products of the cobalt-based catalyst. This comprehensive model also involved modified thermodynamic equation of state and currently is upgraded to enable a direct comparison of the gas-phase and supercritical solvent-assisted FTS reactions under a variety of conditions using the experimental data reported in a recent study by our team (Kasht et al., 2015).

In this paper we present our approach towards developing a comprehensive fixed-bed reactor model for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) on a cobalt-based catalyst using a detailed mechanistic model to predict the FTS product distribution. In the current study, we developed a multi-scale approach to mode the FTS reactor whereby we combine the use of a detailed mechanistic kinetic model with a particle diffusion model to account for heat and mass transfer limitations both locally and in the whole reactor bed. Simultaneously, we have implemented a fixed-bed reactor model, also in MATLAB® that is capable of predicting the whole bed behavior taking into account the heat and mass transfer resistances in the reactor bed such as the loss in catalytic activity due to diffusion in the catalyst pores. For experimental validation of the model, a high pressure bench-scale reactor unit has been utilized. The kinetic model developed here is to be integrated into a model of the whole reactor bed, with a view towards facilitating the optimization and scale-up of novel FTS reactor bed designs for both the conventional gas phase FTS and the supercritical phase FTS.

In order to overcome commercial problems associated with reaction and transport phenomena, the use of supercritical solvents has been proposed to enhance conversion, catalyst stability and improve temperature control in fixed-bed reactors. One of the major challenges in designing the supercritical FTS reactor unit is selecting appropriate solvents of critical properties within the required reaction operating conditions. Numerous alternatives exist and should be screened based on relevant criteria. The main aim of this paper is to develop a screening methodology to identify an optimum supercritical solvent or a mixture of solvents that meet the aforementioned criteria while minimizing the cost and more importantly satisfying the safety constraints. A safety metric system was developed in order to compare the risk issues associated with using different solvents. In addition, an economic analysis of using the different solvents was performed. Finally, a case study was solved to illustrate the use of the proposed metrics and the selection of solvents based on safety and techno-economic criteria. "

Our results showed that the measured catalyst effectiveness factors are proportional to both the fugacity of CO in the bulk phase as well as to its effective diffusivity. The diffusional flux of CO in catalyst pores in the gas phase FTS was found to be higher than that of the supercritical phase FTS, but only at the entrance of the reactor bed. As the conversion increases, the reaction products completely fill the catalyst pores in the gas phase FTS, which results in drastic decrease in the CO concentration and diffusional flux in catalytic pores. Therefore, the catalyst effectiveness factor at the reactor exit drops more than 65% to that of the reactor entrance value. Nevertheless, in supercritical phase FTS, the variations in diffusional flux with conversion are not as intense, therefore the catalyst effectiveness factor along reactor length vary within 20% of the reactor entrance value.

A wide array of hydrocarbon solvents were reviewed, ranging from propane to decane, with numerous blends of two or more of the mentioned paraffins; several fuel cuts were studied as well, such as light and heavy naphtha and diesel. Also, the interaction of the solvents with in situ reaction mixture and products were studied to further insure single phase operation and process feasibility. A concurrent examination of the techno-economic analysis for solvent selection was carried out; this is of utmost importance since the economic incentives as well as the technical conquest (i.e. overcoming design limitations) are the basis for the novel approach to the reactors design and commercialization of this novel technology.

A leading GTL technology is the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process. The objective of this work is to provide a techno-economic analysis of the GTL process and to identify optimization and integration opportunities for cost saving and reduction of energy usage while accounting for the environmental impact. First, a base-case flowsheet is synthesized to include the key processing steps of the plant. Then, a computer-aided process simulation is carried out to determine the key mass and energy flows, performance criteria, and equipment specifications. Next, energy and mass integration studies are performed to address the following items: (a) heating and cooling utilities, (b) combined heat and power (process cogeneration), (c) management of process water, (c) optimization of tail gas allocation, and (d) recovery of catalyst-supporting hydrocarbon solvents. Finally, these integration studies are conducted and the results are documented in terms of conserving energy and mass resources as well as providing economic impact. Finally, an economic analysis is undertaken to determine the plant capacity needed to achieve the break-even point and to estimate the return on investment for the base-case study. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: In recent years, service companies often use a low viscous, fiber-laden fracturing fluid. The added fibers not only assist in the transport of proppant based on mechanical suspension but also prevent proppant settling during fracture closure. Although the chemical composition of the fibers used is not described, their characteristics suggest that they are made of PLA materials. In our experiments, we tested both PGA and PLA fibrous materials using a small scale slotted equipment. The results showed that mixing fibers with a small amount of polymer significantly helped transporting proppant. From the preliminary tests, PLA fibers crumbled and tended to induce proppant screen-out often; thus, only PGA materials were used for the proppant transport experiments. Since the PGA materials were cost prohibitive, we determined the optimum concentration of PGA fibers by changing the polymer concentration of frac fluid and injection rate. We concluded that the suitable amount of fibers is around 0.567 kg (1.25 lbs) / 3785.4 liters (1000 gallons) of slick water. This concentration is economically feasible given that the total fluid injection volume is large for hydraulic fracturing applications. 1. INTRODUCTION We have been testing PGA (Polyglycolic Acid) and PLA (Polylactic Acid) materials for seven years as a fluid-loss control agent. Since the combination of PGA fibers and PGA powder was proven an effective fluid-loss control agent, we further tested it for transporting proppant while minimizing fluid-loss for slick-water fracturing. The tests used a clear small scale proppant transport system. PGA fibers and proppant were mixed with slick water and pumped through a slotted panel made of acrylic plastic to study proppant transport in an open fracture. We pumped the slurry at constant flow rates and observed the proppant distribution. The experiment demonstrated relatively uniform distributions of proppant flow without the formation of proppant bank near the inlet. A service company has documented the application of a low viscous, fiber-laden fluid that can transport proppant effectively. The fibers assist in the transportion of proppant based on a suspension mechanism and prevent proppant settling during fracture closure. The company mentions “degradable materials,” “biodegradable fiber” or “degradable divergent agents” without explicitly citing chemical names and their necessary properties for applications. However, the materials appear to be PLA from the photos. "

                    "abstract": "Numerous papers have been published for predicting the borehole breakout problems (McLean 1990; Zoback 2007; Ewy 1999). The original theory proposed by Zoback (Zoback 2007) used the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory with a linear elastic stress strain relation. Initially, it was applied to igneous rocks and large diameter boreholes. With these original applications, the linear Mohr-Coulomb theory predicted the breakout width within a reasonable accuracy. Recently, the applications have been expanded to breakout problems for shales, mudstones and sandstones. However, there are some drawbacks. For sedimentary rock applications, the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory significantly over-predicts the breakout width. In addition, strong rocks show significant non-linearity before failure, hence, we need to artificially increase unconfined rock strength (UCS) and friction angle. The theoretical breakout width cannot be matched with the breakout width observed from the image logs unless these adjustments are made. Using the image logs and the rock strength measurements obtained from several fields, comparative analyses were conducted for various failure theories with linear and non-linear stress strains. These failure theories include Mohr-Coulomb, Drucker-Prager, Lade, Modified-Lade, Mogi and critical plastic strain. The authors also compared linear and non-linear stress strain theories. The authors estimated the increase in UCS necessary to match the breakout widths observed from the image logs obtained from several fields. The authors utilized caliper logs to compare the breakout depths as well. The results show that if a linear stress strain relation is used, UCS must be increased artificially by 1.09-2.25 times. This increase is as much as 2.25 times for the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. On the other hand, if a non-linear stress strain relation is used, no artificial increase is necessary except for the Mohr-Coulomb failure theory. In addition, the effects of temperature change and shale swelling are varied depending on the failure theories. These effects are supposed to de-stabilize the boreholes. Interestingly, the borehole stability differs depending on the failure theory used. Moreover, the actual breakout depths are always deeper than those predicted with a linear stress strain theory while they are shallower than those predicted by a slip line failure theory. This paper compares the merits and demerits of each failure theory when applied to borehole breakout problems. Many triaxial tests were conducted to determine the stress strain and failure envelopes. The predicted breakout widths were compared with the measured breakout widths from the image logs. This kind of comprehensive evaluation (theoretical, experimental and field analyses) has not been performed in previous studies. "

                    "abstract": "Fluid loss is significant for the standard fracturing fluids without adding solid materials. One method to reduce fluid loss is to add silica flour, although it reduces fracture conductivity. Other methods are to use wall-building polymers. However, the fluid loss is still significant, and complete removal of wall-building materials is not possible, even with breakers. We found that powder, granular, and fibrous materials made of polyglycolic acid (PGA) or polylactic acid (PLA) are very suitable for fluid-loss agents because PGA is stronger than steel and PLA is as strong as rock, although they dissolve as liquid acids after applications. Fluid-loss tests are conducted with the standard American Petroleum Institute slot tester and filtrate-loss tester, mixing powders, grains, and fiber, all made of PGA or PLA in fracturing polymer fluids. The ratio of grains, powder, and fiber is optimized to minimize fluid loss for porous media and fractured porous media. Then, the changes of particle size are measured under heated conditions. Fracture-simulation studies are also conducted with a 3D fracture boundary element model to compare the fluid efficiency of the fracturing fluids with and without the PLA and PGA particles. The results show that the capability of preventing fluid loss and plugging microcracks is maintained for the porous filters and small slots within a reasonable time period. For short-term applications less than 3 hours, both PGA and PLA fluid-loss agents are stable when the temperature is less than 212F. Mixing these materials often provides more-efficient properties to reduce fluid loss and to bridge microcracks. No residues are left after experiments if the fracturing fluid is kept heated for 24 hours. The amount of the PGA and PLA fluid-loss agents required to reduce the fluid loss is not significant. Hence, their field applications are feasible, judging the cost and the benefit. The advantage in using these materials is that they turn from solid to liquid after applications so that no formation damage and no proppant-conductivity damage occur. The fluid loss is also significantly reduced with the powder particles. In addition, because the PGA and PLA materials are degradable, solids with arbitrary sizes and shapes may be used as long as they control fluid loss and plug fine fractures. Their applications are not only limited to reducing fluid loss, but one may also use them for engineering fracture design to enhance the fracture conductivity. "

                    "abstract": "Comparative studies of perforation stability with a standard TWC tester (Thick Wall Cylinder tester) and a new compact TPS tester (Triaxial Perforation Stability tester) were performed using sandstone cores with UCS (Unconfined Compressive Rock Strength) ranging from 500 to 7000 psi. This paper aims two objectives: one for advocating the merits of a new technology and the other for improving the interpretation of the conventional TWC test results. TWC testers are commonly used for evaluating perforation stability to predict the onset of sand production (Geertsma, J. 1985). However, most users are confused how to interpret the results since the TWC testers use cylindrical cores where only uniform confining pressure can be applied, while the real in-situ stress is directional around perforations. The core-cut directions are parallel or perpendicular to the whole core axis and are different between companies. The new triaxial perforation tunnel stability tester uses conditions similar to the real perforations. Note that the TPS tester uses cubic rocks with a 0.5 inch hole and the ratio of the horizontal to vertical stresses in perpendicular to the hole axis can be varied between 0.3 to 1.0. Using these two devices, various rock samples were tested varying the ratio of horizontal and vertical stresses. The results showed that unlike the standard TWC tests, the perforation stability tests with the same in-situ stress ratio as the field one did not require corrections of directional in-situ stress effect. Note that depending on rock non-linearity, complex correction factors from hydrostatic confining stress to directional stress is required for the TWC tests since pre-mature failures are commonly observed for hydrostatic loading. A guideline of interpretation of the TWC results is given based on the comparison of TWC and TPS tests for the correction factor of the TWC tests if the results are applied for directional stresses. Using the new compact perforation stability tester is also advocated since the new tester is as compact as the standard TWC tester and the interpretation of the results is simple and accurate since the directional stress is applied with the same stress ratio as the field stress condition.

                    "abstract": "Multi-finger caliper logs obtained from the wells in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea showed significant casing deformations, while they were still usable without losing integrity. The reason was that most of these casings were uniformly deformed without rupture or without kinks. The magnitude of elongation and compression of these casings were 3 to 5% while the strains at the yield strength were 0.3-0.5%. These observations indicate that casing design should include the steel properties beyond the yield strength while the API casing designcriterion is strictly based on the steel properties up to the yield strength. Extension and compression casing tests were conducted from H-40 to V-150 casings up to failure by using a 5000 kN loading machine. For compression tests, some casings were cemented within a larger pipe to prevent the lateral buckling simulating the in-situ confinement condition. The tests gave the following results: (1) Under extension tests, the casings were uniformly deformed after exceeding the yield strength. The uniform deformation continued while the casing were stretched by 4 to 25% until non-uniform deformation was induced. (2) The strain up to the peak strength was as large as 25% for H-40 casings while it was as small as 4% for P-110 and higher grade of casings. (3) For compression tests, uniform compression continued exceeding the yield point. The uniform deformation continued up to the peak strength which varied from 3% to 12% from V-150 to H-40 casings. Both the cemented casings and short casings induced axisymmetric wrinkles (local buckling) after uniform deformation. (4) The higher grade casings did not significantly increase the maximum strength after yielding while lower grade casings increased the strength while being stretched or compressed uniformly after yielding. The analyses show that the casing failure observed in the fields can be explained from the casing failure tests beyond the yield points. The casings are uniformly deformed until the maximum load so that they are usable up to the maximum strength without significant distortion. In the past, casing failures were tried to be mitigated by increasing the casing grade, however, increasing the grade sometimes deteriorated the casing problems since a higher grade casing could not tolerate the significant stretch or compression once they exceeded the yield stress. Selecting a proper grade and thickness of casings is the key for mitigating casing failure where the data of casing deformation beyond the yield strength are essential information for casing designing using geomechanical models. This paper analyzed the casing deformation data of several North Sea chalk reservoirs and Gulf of Mexico sandstone reservoirs provided by oil companies and determined the usable limit of casing deformation based on the laboratory and field measurements.

                    "abstract": "When reservoir compaction occurs during production, the overburden formation deformation results in ocean floor subsidence and lateral movement. When a long term water or CO2 injection operation is performed, the overburden formation becomes unstable due to the reservoir expansion. These field operations induce formation strain and pore pressure change in all overburden formations. Predicting the magnitude of formation strain and pore pressure change is important for analysis of borehole stability, casing stability and overburden formation stability. Two methods are developed in this paper. One is an analytical method assuming no mechanical property contrast between overburden and reservoir formations. The other is a set of figures created by a numerical model for predicting formation strains and pore pressure change during compaction and expansion with mechanical property contrast between overburden and reservoir formations. The parameter analyses give the following results: (1) Formation strain becomes significantly large if the Young’s modulus of overburden formation becomes small. The casing design must be conducted including the formation strain of cap rock. (2) If the shear modulus between overburden and reservoir formations is similar, the pore pressure increases at the overburden formations. However, if the difference of the shear modulus is large, the pore pressure decreases in the upper and lower cap rock with reservoir compaction. This new finding may change our common sense of pore pressure change of shale section around a reservoir. This paper provides a set of equations and figures to quickly predict the pore pressure change and formation strain focusing on overburden formation where casing and formation stability problems are induced during production and injection operations. If the quick analysis indicates that the overburden strain and pore pressure change significantly affect the field operations, comprehensive analysis must be conducted with a geomechanical finite element model using a super computer.

                    "abstract": "Many casing- and screen-damage incidents have been reported in deepwater oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico and other locations around the world. We reviewed historical casing/well failure events in a highly compacting sandstone field and performed a comprehensive geomechanics analysis of various casing- damage mechanisms (tension, axial compression, shear, and bending) related to large reservoir depletion. Among five wells that experienced mechanical well-integrity issues, two of them showed casing restrictions in the caprock at intervals approximately 1,000- to 1,600-ft true vertical depth (TVD) above the top of the depleting (main) reservoir. A multi-finger caliper log obtained from one of the wells indicates that the overburden casing failure occurred at a highly geopressured, thin sand layer approximately 1,100-ft TVD above the top of the compacting reservoir. The remaining casing-failure events occurred near (less than 200-ft TVD) or within the compacting reservoir interval. A 3D nonlinear finite-element-method (FEM) model has been developed for simulating stress changes in the overburden and the reservoir intervals and evaluating the effect of lithological anomalies on casing stability. The simulation results indicate that large tensile and shear strains could develop within a thin, weak-strength layer in the overburden and at the interface between caprock and the depleting reservoir interval. Casing damage by bending/shear could also occur at these thin-layered sands saturated with overpressured gas. In the reservoir interval, shear stresses acting on the screens can be relatively high because of the difference of the movements between the internal base pipe and the external shroud and gravel. Screen failure may also occur at the welded points. If casing failure occurs in the unperforated sand layer just above the compacting reservoir, it induces localized high-velocity flow on the upper part of the screen, causing potential screen erosion. Casing failure caused by fault slip near the reservoir occurs only if a fault has sealing capability while maintaining a large pressure differential across the fault plane. The numerical-analysis results presented in this work help engineers understand possible casing- and screen- deformation and -failure mechanisms experienced in highly compacting sandstone fields. On the basis of the study findings, we also present some completion-design guidelines to avoid or mitigate compaction-induced casing damage in both the overburden and reservoir intervals. "

                    "abstract": "The recent scientific drilling operations have proved that wells as deep as 6000-ft. from ocean bottom can be safely drilled with small riserless drill ships. However, the problem is that theweight of the drilling fluid must beoccasionally increased from the sea water density to 9 ~ 11-ppg. The problems encountered while using weighted polymer drilling fluids are wellbore instability, stuck pipe induced by lost circulation and insufficient cutting transport problems. Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) have been widely used for medical operations,since the products left in human body dissolve with time. One of the properties desired for lost circulation materials is that the materials prevent lost circulation problems during application, while they disappear when they are disposed to ocean bottom duringriserlessdrilling. The lost circulation resistance tests are conducted using the standard API slot tester, mixing fibers, grains and powders, all made of PGAor PLA in a Xanthan Gum polymer drill-in fluid. Ratio of fibers, grains and powder is optimized to maximizethe lost circulation resistance for 0.04 and 0.12-inch slots. Then, the changes of particle size and fiber strength with time are measured. Cutting retention tests with the fibrous LCM are also performed to check the cutting retention capability when the circulation is ceased during the connection of drill pipes. The cutting fall rate is measured changing fiber concentration, pipe diameter and cutting volumes. The results show that the capability of preventing lost circulation is maintained withina reasonable time. PGA and PLA lost circulation materials are applicable when the temperature is less than 60ºC. The fibrous LCM can also have a capability of cutting retention so that the cutting fall rate is trivial even if the fluid circulation is stopped. The conclusion shows that the PGA and PLA LCM are capable of sealing fractures for drilling low temperature wells up to 60ºC and the fibrous PGA and PLA also help to transport cuttings from well bottom. The merit of PGA is the high strength during the first several hours and the merit of PLA is the pro-longed strength although its initial strength is low. The dissolution time is several days for PGA LCM while it is several weeks for PLA LCM. The strength and dissolution time can be adjusted by the grain sizes and mixture ratio of these two polymers. This paper emphasizes that when the mud weight is increased, mixing lost circulation materials with enhancing cutting transport capability is important to conserve the mud volume since, for riserless drilling, the weighted mud is not circulated back to the mud pit.

                    "abstract": "An offshore gas field has been producing sand for a few years. Sand production has been closely monitored through acoustic flowline devices and a sand-collection system installed on the platforms. Observation of sand production has triggered evaluation of whether to install surface desanders or to complete future wells with downhole sand control. This evaluation requires a prediction of sanding rate over the reservoir life. The possibility of providing downhole sand control on existing wells was also evaluated in separate studies. Predicting sanding rate, particularly for gas fields, has been historically challenging, mainly because of the sporadic nature of sand production, inadequate quantification of fundamental physics, and lack of representative laboratory tests and reliable field calibration. To tackle these challenges, four studies have been designed and executed: (1) the development of a reliable log-based rock-strength estimate, (2) the prediction of sanding rate over the reservoir life for a conservative well condition, (3) the evaluation of sand-particle transport from the reservoir to the surface facilities, and (4) the estimate of potential erosion of platform facilities. The sanding-rate prediction is based on extensive laboratory tests of four carefully selected whole cores with gas and water flow. It then has been validated by field-monitoring data from an acoustic flowline device on each producer and a sand-collection system on the platforms. The studies have provided a prediction of (1) future sand production, (2) how much of the produced sand will be seen at the surface (and, therefore, how much of it will fall into the rathole), (3) how fast various components of the surface facility will erode over the field life, and (4) what will be the optimal completion strategy for sand control should it become necessary. They have provided input to an integrated evaluation of completion design, reservoir management, platform configuration, and field economics. "

                    "title": "A New Compact Triaxial Perforation Tunnel Stability Tester",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Thick wall cylinder testers (TWC testers) are commonly used for evaluating perforation stability. However, the results are ambiguous since the standard TWC testers use cylindrical cores where only uniform confining pressure can be applied, while the real in-situ stress is directional around perforations. A new triaxial perforation tunnel stability tester (TPS tester) is developed to simulate perforation stability under more realistic conditions. Normally, it requires a relatively large pressure cell and three independent pressure pumps to create a triaxial stress state in a cubic sample. However, the equipment developed in this paper is as simple and as small as the standard TWC testers with the following configurations:  (A) Sample is a cubic rock with a 0.5 inch hole as the standard TWC test. The dimension of the cubic sample is 1.5 in. x 1.5 in. and the thickness is adjusted by core availability (normally varies from 0.75 in. to 1.5 in.).  (B) The stress ratio of the horizontal to vertical stresses in perpendicular to the hole axis can be varied between 0.33 to 1.0. The pressurization system requires only one pump by increasing the two confining stresses proportionally. A square jacket has a device to induce the directional loading.  (C) The pressure cell is as small as the standard TWC tester and the test procedure is also as simple as the standard TWC test.  Using the above device, various rock samples are tested varying the ratio of horizontal and vertical stresses. The results show that unlike the standard TWC tests, the perforation stability tests with the same in-situ stress ratio as the field one do not require corrections of directional in-situ stress effect. Note that depending on rock non-linearity, complex correction factors from hydrostatic confining stress to directional stress is required for the standard TWC tests since pre-mature failures are commonly observed for hydrostatic loading. The equipment is handy and portable so that it can be used in a small field laboratory.  Introduction Predicting the onset of sand production is very important for managing sand problems:  (1)  Our long field experiences have shown that if the onset of sand production does not occur during the first two thirds of reservoir life, sand problems are manageable since the sand production rates are not significant from a formation strong enough without producing sand for the long period. The sand problems reduce with production rate since the oil or gas flow rate declines during the later field life. Hence, many companies just predict onset of sand production for sand management purpose without using a less reliable sand rate model.  (2) The conditions to induce onset of sand production significantly affect sand rate. Normally, the parameters of a sand rate model are adjusted coinciding with the sand rate initiation using calculated onset of sand production.  Currently, two methods are used to predict the onset of sand production:  (A)  A finite element model with non-linear constitutive equations is applied for perforation tunnel stability analysis. Triaxial stress strain measurements are required to construct a set of non-linear constitutive equations and failure analysis. UCS is also measured for 50-100 intervals to identify the formation strength distribution and to correlate the unconfined compressive rock strength (UCS) and log-calculated rock strength parameters.  (B) Thick wall cylinder tests (TWC) are performed for 50-100 intervals to predict the onset of sand production correcting the effects of directional stress and the core boundary size. These data are also used to correlate the TWC and log-calculated rock strength parameters. "

                    "title": "A Comprehensive Modeling Analysis of Borehole Stability and Production-Liner Deformation for Inclined/Horizontal Wells Completed in a Highly Compacting Chalk Formation",
                    "abstract": "Numerous casing and production-liner deformation/failure problems have been reported in high-porosity chalk formations in both the overburden and the reservoir sections, causing costly operation problems that prevent workovers and recompletions. This paper presents the results of studies performed to investigate stability of an openhole, cemented liner and uncemented-liner completions in a highly compacting chalk formation. The effects of critical cavity dimensions caused by various acid-stimulation techniques were also investigated. On the basis of the review of historical caliper-survey data, we ascertain that axial-compression collapse is a major liner-deformation mechanism in the reservoir zones. Axial-compression collapse has been found in both low-angle wells (also in buildup sections of horizontal wells) and horizontal laterals. The casing deformation in low-angle sections is a result of reservoir compaction (i.e., change in the vertical formation strain), while the deformation in horizontal sections is primarily induced by increased axial loading because of cavity deformation. The current completion practice using cluster perforations and high-volume acid treatments causes vertically enlarged cavities, resulting in poor radial constraint. A series of laboratory triaxial tests was performed on selected reservoir chalk samples to measure the stress/strain and failure behavior of the chalk formation considering a wide range of porosity and water saturation and different levels of confining pressures. Using the chalk-failure criteria and constitutive relations developed from the analysis of laboratory triaxial-compression-test data, a 3D nonlinear poroelastic/plastic finite-element-method (FEM) model was developed for the openhole stability analysis. The simulation results show that the abnormally high ductility of chalks after pore collapse around a borehole could actually enhance borehole stability, with a magnitude beyond expectation. In this study, analytical and numerical models are also developed for evaluating cavity-induced axial- compression collapse of production liners. Model results indicate that the risk of the cavity-induced axial- compression collapse substantially increases for short perforated intervals stimulated with large acid treatments. However, increasing the perforation-interval lengths along the entire liner axis results in more-uniform acid distribution and will greatly reduce the chance of axial-compression collapse caused by localized cavity deformation. On the basis of these analysis results, key completion design criteria and stimulation strategies were developed for wells completed in highly compacting chalk reservoirs to reduce risk of casing and liner mechanical problems.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) has been widely used as a string to stitch scars during medical operations. The string left in human body dissolves with time. It is harmless and biodegradable. Although these properties are attractive, the high cost prevents for oil field applications. However, a technology has been developed to produce tons of PGA with a low cost. Granular CaCO3 has been used as a fluid loss control material for completion fluids. The mud cake has to be removed after completion instruments are installed, but tends to remain partially undissolved. The PGA powder turns to be a liquid acid with time if it is mixed in water. It is also environmentally harmless if it is disposed in ocean. It is judged that these properties may be suitable to replace the granular CaCO3.  The experiments consist of viscosity, fluid loss, and cake thickness measurements varying temperature and particle size distribution by using PGA powder as a fluid loss control material in a Xanthan Gum polymer completion fluid. Particle size distribution is optimized to minimize fluid loss. Then, the particle size change with time is measured. The mud cake consisting of PGA powder completely disappears after several days.  The results show that the amount of fluid loss tends to decrease when the particle size is finer. Similarly, the thickness of the mud cake is significantly affected by the particle size distribution of PGA powder. It is proved that the PGA completion fluid has better mud properties compared with commercially available low solid polymer fluids. The advantage of the PGA powder as a fluid loss control material is (A) no permeability loss since it disappears with time in pores, (B) a low fluid loss since particle distribution is optimized to minimize fluid loss, (C) no acidizing is required after use since it dissolves itself due to hydrolysis, and (D) it is environmentally harmless.  Introduction Since early 19th century, drilling and completion fluids are advanced with rotary drilling. However, numerous field reports and literatures have shown that the contamination of solid components into the pore, into the gravel pack and around screens have significantly reduced productivity. Furthermore, they have caused environmental damage if they are not disposed properly.  The standard drilling and completion fluids use granular CaCO3, salt, pitch, fiber, and plates as filtrate loss and fluid loss control materials. Although some of these materials are removable with acid or by flowing back, it is difficult to completely remove them. It is especially difficult to remove once they are mixed with gravel pack gravels, propants, or, they are penetrated into pores or natural fractures. In addition, during riserless drilling, mud sweeps are often performed to control wells. These drilling fluids are disposed into deep ocean, which has become the source of environmental damage. PGA is a biodegradable thermoplastic polymer with (C2H2O2)n molecular formula and a linear aliphatic polyester. "

The ultimate goal is to measure the attractiveness of the Uruguayan oil and gas fiscal regime. Based on the probabilistic model of a hypothetical oil and gas field development offshore, and Production Sharing Contracts cash flow diagrams, the Government Take, Effective Royalty Rate, Savings Index and Lifting Entitlement were calculated and averaged for all the Production Sharing Contracts in force in Uruguay. In addition, the Progressivity of the Uruguayan fiscal regime for oil and gas was tested, a crucial feature of the fiscal regime design considering the fluctuations in crude oil prices. The calculated mean values were compared with international petroleum contract averages obtained from literature. Regardless of the fact that third party assessments attribute important volumes of hydrocarbon prospective resources to Uruguayan frontier basins (USGS 2011, 2012), there has never been a discovery in them yet and the geological risk is still significant. The main results of this work are that the terms of the contracts in force result in an average Government Take of approximately 70%, comparable with the Government Take of several hydrocarbons producing countries. Additionally, the calculated average Effective Royalty Rate was 9%, the Entitlement for the IOC averaged 52%, and the Savings Index resulted in 48%, all of them among worldwide standards. The Uruguayan fiscal system proved to be progressive, revealing state-of-the-art fiscal design. The overall conclusion is that the Uruguayan fiscal regime is fair (or could even be regarded as too harsh) considering the geological risk of the country's basins. This work is useful for petroleum companies interested in assessing the hydrocarbon exploration and production potential of Uruguay, to easily compare the contract economy and its fiscal regime with other destinations. Furthermore, it might provide good insight to authorities to understand the attractiveness of the Uruguayan petroleum fiscal regime for design improvements. "

                    "abstract": "As the subsea industry ages, the number of premature subsea well shut downs are increasing due to insufficient well intervention programs.  In the past, subsea well interventions have not been widely used because of a lack of economic feasibility; however, with appropriate project planning, the recent economic climate, and advances in well intervention technology, a greater overall project return can be realized by implementing a proactive well intervention program.  While intervention on surface wells is a familiar topic, the benefits and negative consequences of more recent subsea intervention developments, such as riser-less light well intervention, riser-less mud return, and well flow back and testing, are evaluated.  These different well intervention methods carry varying amounts of risk with them, with the potential to greatly enhance or diminish well performance and thus affect recoverable hydrocarbons.  The risks involved with the different well intervention methods are evaluated and recommendations are made as to which methods are utilized depending on desired return rates and risk aversion levels.  Recommendations are made for implementing a successful well intervention program, such as production monitoring, scenario planning, application of a dedicated multi-disciplinary team, cross-organizational collaboration, and logistical improvements.  With an effective well intervention program, reservoirs can be further exploited, potentially increasing project return and supplying hydrocarbons to a demanding global market. Introduction Secondary Recovery Methods Integral to Initial Field Development Employing secondary recovery methods is becoming integral to initial onshore field development in order to achieve maximum hydrocarbon returns.  Original onshore field development practices consisted of operators exhausting primary depletion, then installing waterflood facilities and converting producers to water injectors.  This caused a protracted period of reservoirs being without pressure support, leading to complications with shut-in wells and underutilized pipelines and facilities.  An early success in changing this approach was in the high-risk Arctic development, the Kuparuk River Field (Nelson 2007).  Kuparuk’s initial production began in 1981 and by the end of 1982, ninety wells were completed, 75 of them producers.  Immediately following the wells being brought online, waterflooding began in January 1983.  This increased the expected ultimate recovery from 350-600 million to 1.25-1.5 billion barrels of oil.  The project faced considerable technical challenges in waterflooding due to the cold temperatures of the North Slope, but due to the focus placed on reservoir management rather than just field development, the technical challenges were overcome and waterflooding helped the project surpass production levels ahead of schedule.  Similar to what was experienced in Kuparuk, secondary recovery methods made integral to initial subsea well field development could help achieve maximum hydrocarbon production, and thus, maximum project returns.

                    "abstract": "As a result of the bidding Round 2009 and Uruguay Round II, 10 Production Sharing Agreements were signed for offshore areas, in which 8 IOCs are involved as contractors. The exploration that is currently taking place implies a superlative increase in the knowledge of Uruguayan offshore basins. For awarding onshore contracts there is an open door system in place. The fiscal regime is very similar to the one applied offshore, but with slight differences. Nowadays there are 4 contracts for exploration-exploitation of hydrocarbons onshore Uruguay, with 2 IOCs as contractors, in Uruguayan Norte basin, which is the southern extension of Chaco Paranaense Basin. The Norte basin potentially has Devonian-age shale oil and shale gas resources, in addition to conventional leads and prospects. This work presents an economic assessment for a shale gas and shale oil development in a 10 000 km2 Area in Norte Basin, resulting that the viability of the project could only be possible in the values of EUR higher than the P5 case, and it is strongly related to the drainage area and the cost of drilling, completing and hydraulic fracturing of the wells. In addition, for the sake of comparison of profitability indexes and project profit distribution related to slightly different fiscal regimes, the same resources volumes were considered for an offshore project. On the other hand, the results show that the offshore development project is economically viable for the case of higher resources volumes. Finally, the Minimum Economic Field Size was calculated for offshore prospects, for the oil and associated gas case. This work constitutes a first approach to a technical/economic evaluation applied to the development of unconventional resources onshore Uruguay, comparing its results to conventional prospects offshore Uruguay. Its findings and conclusions are significant for those international oil companies that are already carrying out or interested in potentially conducting exploration activities in both onshore and/or offshore Uruguayan basins. The results of this assessment are also very illustrative of the comparison of government's take for the different onshore and offshore fiscal regimes and represent a valuable input for ANCAP and the Uruguayan government to take into consideration to define offered areas policies.

Government take, including the National Oil Company association in the case of a discovery, is already fixed under the Production Sharing Contracts in force and do not vary much with the field size. Therefore, a possible strategy to maximize the local revenues (income from Uruguayan services, products and human resources), which constitutes a key part for a sound distribution of petroleum revenues within the country, would be to increase the local content in the supply chain. Taking into consideration analogous geological basins, and the geological and technical probability of success for offshore Uruguay as a frontier basin, the field size and hydrocarbon potential was evaluated from a stochastic point of view. The cash flow analysis of a hypothetic oil development was carried out, incorporating the actual economic variables of the contracts in force offshore Uruguay, as well as the current fiscal regime. The standard project parameters, investments yardsticks and the government and contractor takes were calculated with the aim to obtain the Uruguayan rent and the relative impact of the local content. This work constitutes the first approach to the analysis of expenditures and investment during the current stage of exploration, and the eventual phases of appraisal, development and production offshore Uruguay. The technical and economic evaluation applied to a portfolio of offshore prospects models the level of expenditures and investment from exploration to production. The assessment of the potential impact of the activity on macroeconomic variables is carried out considering the local services and products that would be necessary for each stage, in order to identify the areas where increasing local content will provide the larger impact in the country economy.

                    "abstract": "Fracture height is a critical input parameter for 2D hydraulic-fracturing-design models, and also an important output result of 3D models. Although many factors may influence fracture-height evolution in multilayer formations, the consensus is that the so-called “equilibrium height belonging to a certain treating pressure” provides an upper limit. However, because of the complexity of the algebra involved, published height models are overly simplified and do not provide reliable results. We revisited the equilibrium-height problem, started from the definition of the fracture stress-intensity factor (SIF), considered variation of layered formation properties and effects of hydrostatic pressure, and developed a multilayer fracture-equilibrium-height (MFEH) model by use of the programming software Mathematica (2017). The detailed derivation of SIF and work flow of MFEH model are provided. The model is compared with existing models and software, under the same ideal geology condition. Generally, MShale (2013) calculated smaller height, and FracPro (2015) larger height, than the MFEH model. Most of the difference is attributable to the different interpretation of the “net pressure,” and the solving of the nonlinear equations of SIF as well. In the normally stressed case, they are both acceptable, although MShale is more reliable. The discrepancy is much larger when there is abnormally high or low stress in the adjacent layers of the perforated interval. The effects of formation rock and fluid properties on the fracture-height growth were investigated. Tip jump is caused by low in-situ stress, whereas tip stability is imposed by large fracture toughness and/or large in-situ stress. If the fluid density is ignored, the result regarding which tip will grow into infinity could be totally different. Second and even third and fourth solutions for a three-layer problem were found by Excel experiments and this model, and proved unrealistic; however, they can be avoided in our MFEH model. The full-height map with very-large top- and bottom-formation thicknesses shows the ultimate trend of height-growth map (i.e., when the fracture tip will grow to infinity) and suggests the maximum pressure to be used. To assess the potential effects of reservoir-parameter uncertainties on the height map, two three-layer pseudoproblems were constructed by use of a multilayer formation to create an outer- and inner-height envelope. The improved MFEH model fully characterizes height evolution amid various formation and fluid properties (fracture toughness, in-situ stress, thickness, and fluid density), and for the first time, rigorously and rapidly solves the equilibrium height. The equilibrium height can be used to provide input data for the 2D model, improve the 3D-model governing equations, determine the net pressure needed to achieve a certain height growth, and suggest the maximum net pressure ensuring no fracture propagation into aquifers. This model may be incorporated into current hydraulic-fracture-propagation simulators to yield more-accurate and -cost-effective hydraulic-fracturing designs. "

Combining the characteristics of single particle diffusion with complex fracture geometry, it is indicated that anomalous diffusion phenomenon will be dominant on the reservoir scale, even for single phase production behavior. Then a model based on Markov chain is presented to demonstrate the proposed anomalous diffusion by simulating the partical normal diffusion on a geometric graph and then calculating the relation of the mean square displacement vs. time in the embedding Euclidean space. Based on the simulation results, in consequence, we make a discussion on the characteristic size of the heterogeneity due to the fracture network on the reservoir scale, summarize 2 types of pattern for the anomalous diffusion, and provide a supportive argument for using the fractional diffusivity equation, in place of the classical one, to model the flow and production behavior in highly fractured unconventional reservoirs.

In this work, a physics-based decline-curve model accounting for linear flow and material balance in horizontal multistage-hydraulically-fractured wells is introduced. The main characteristics of pressure diffusion in the porous media and the fact that the reservoir is a limited resource are embedded in the functional form, such that there is a transition from transient to boundary-dominated flow and the EUR is always finite. Analogously to the frequently used Arps (1945) hyperbolic model, the new model has only three parameters, where two of them define the decline profile and the third one is a multiplier. This model is applied to a large data set in a work flow that incorporates heuristic knowledge into the history matching and uncertainty quantification by assigning weights to rate measurements. The heuristic rules aim to lessen the effects of nonreservoir-related variations in the production data (e.g., temporary shut-in caused by fracturing in a neighboring well) and emphasize the reservoir dynamics to perform reliable predictions. However, there are additional degrees of freedom in the way these rules define the values of the weights; therefore, a criterion is established that “calibrates” the uncertainty in the probabilistic models by adjusting the parameters in the heuristic rules. Uncertainty quantification and calibration are performed using a Bayesian approach with hindcasts. This methodology is implemented in an automated framework and applied to 992 gas wells from the Barnett Shale. A comparison with the Arps (1945) hyperbolic model, the Duong (2011) model, and stretched exponential model for this data set shows that the new model is the most conservative in terms of estimated reserves.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: For modern multi-well, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing operations, reservoir heterogeneity and stress shadow effects strongly affect fracture geometries. The laminas can act as weak interfaces confining the hydraulic fracture height growth and becoming potential fracture propagation path. We developed a numerical simulator using Finite-Discrete Element Method (FDEM) to simulate the complex fracture propagation in laminated shale formations. This is a 2D coupled fluid flow and geomechanics code which is capable of simulating fracture propagation in naturally fractured, laminated reservoirs. Several cases of multi-stage, multi-well fracture propagation were conducted using this simulator. Our simulation results show that for multi-stage hydraulic fracturing propagation, the fracture length along the BP is a deterministic factor affecting the neighboring fracture propagation path due to the induced stresses. Moreover, we proposed a novel multi-fracture, multi-stage fracturing design, which can create larger stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) than classical Texas two-steps technique in laminated shale formations under some specific scenarios. This paper provides a framework for more realistic prediction of fracture height and fracture evolution under multi-fracture, multi-stage schemes in laminated shale formations in hydraulic fracturing treatment. 1. INTRODUCTION Horizontal wells with multi-stage hydraulic fractures (HFs) are proved to be the key techniques for maximizing the oil and gas production from unconventional reservoirs with ultra-low permeability. During hydraulic fracturing treatments in unconventional reservoirs, complex fracture network can be developed for transporting hydrocarbon to the wellbore [1]. Many factors, such as mechanical properties of formations, properties of weak interfaces and completion designs etc., can have huge effect on complex fracture geometry. Shale formations typically have laminated structures which is in the form of bedding layers and stratification. The laminas can act as weak interfaces, and fractures can propagate along the BP interfaces [2]. Such geological media exhibit transversely isotropic mechanical behavior, which means that five independent mechanical material constants: Eh, Ev, Vh, Vv and G[3] are needed for mechanical characterization. Here, Eh and Ev are Young’s moduli in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, Vh and Vv are Poisson’s ratios in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively, and G is shear modulus.

                    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the development plan of shale gas or tight oil with multiple multistage fractured laterals in a large square drainage area that we call a “section” (usually 640 acres in the US). We propose a convenient section-based optimization of the fracture array with two integer variables, the number of columns (horizontal laterals) and rows (fractures created in a lateral), to provide some general statements regarding spacing of wells and fractures. The approach is dependent on a reliable and efficient productivity-index (PI) calculation for the boundary-dominated state (BDS). The dimensionless PI is obtained by solving a time-independent eigenvalue problem by use of the finite-element method (FEM) combined with the Richardson extrapolation. The results of the case study demonstrate two decisive factors: the dimensionless total fracture length, related to the total amount of proppant and fracturing fluid available for the section, and the feasible range of actual fracture half-lengths, related to current fracturing-technology limitations. Under the constraint of dimensionless total fracture length, increasing the number of columns (horizontal laterals) increases the total PI but with only diminishing returns, whereas the optimal fracture-penetration ratio decreases somewhat, but is still near unity. When adding the technological constraint of a limited range of fracture half-lengths that can be routinely and reliably created, only a few choices remain admissible, and the optimal decision can be easily made. These general statements for the ideal homogeneous and isotropic formation can serve as a reference in the more-detailed optimization works. In other words, we offer a first-pass method for decision making in early stages when detailed inputs are not yet available. The information derived from the section-based optimization method and the efficient and reliable algorithm for PI calculation should help the design of multistage fracturing in shale-gas or ultralow-permeability oil formations.

                    "abstract": "The standard models of liquid loading in gas wells relate the \"onset of liquid loading\" to the concept of \"critical gas velocity\". As a mechanistic multiphase-flow concept, the critical gas velocity would be the smallest velocity of the upward flowing gas still providing enough drag to rule out liquid accumulation in the wellbore. The richness of the related phenomena in the gas field, however, comes from the interaction of multiphase-flow in the well and in the reservoir. The concept of critical gas velocity (or rate) is in fact misleading, because steady state upward flow of a gas-liquid mixture can happen at arbitrary low gas velocities, if the inlet boundary condition is constant-rate type. In addition, the actual transient liquid accumulation processes are virtually impossible to reproduce under laboratory conditions. Therefore, transforming laboratory observations directly into onset prediction models – however often it is done – has not lead to major breakthrough in comparison to what the pioneering \"critical gas rate\" models could already offer. In contrast, our work focuses on improvements in determining the overall liquid-content in the wellbore, and in assessing the strongly related flowing bottomhole pressure. Since in typical gas wells we still have to rely on observations at the wellhead, we look for a method which is capable to detect the gradual increase of the overall liquid-content in the wellbore, way before the actual liquid loading phenomena become obvious. The approach presented here relies on an empirical correlation that was originally developed to predict the liquid hold-up for multiphase upward flow affected by partial flow reversal in long vertical pipes. In general, the correlation can be used as an alternative method for calculating the gravitational component of the pressure difference between wellhead and bottomhole. Regarding the other components (friction and acceleration related) we rely on accepted industry standards. We show that our method provides better accuracy for bottomhole pressure calculation, using published data for 78 vertical gas wells. Then we make some recommendations for applying the method for deviated well sections. "

                    "abstract": "Laminated structures in shale formations typically result in anisotropic elastic properties, including Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio, which highly influence hydraulic fracturing treatment execution. The lamina can confine the hydraulic fracture height growth and they sometimes act as weak interfaces for potential fracture propagation path. Hydraulic fracture geometries are highly affected by these properties. In order to make more accurate prediction of hydraulic fracture pattern, especially fracture height, these factors cannot be ignored. We utilized a recently developed Finite Element-Discrete Element Method (FEDEM) code to simulate the complex fracture propagation in shale formations. This coupled fluid flow and geomechanics simulation can also models multi-fracture, multi well fracture propagation scenarios. For simulating fracture height growth, the bedding planes module (with corresponding mechanical anisotropy properties generation) are incorporated. Both 2D and 3D hydraulic fracture propagation studies can be performed. Our simulation results show that without considering the mechanical anisotropy effect, the treatment design will be corrupted by the inaccurate prediction of fracture height. To be more specific, in typical mechanical anisotropic formation, fracture height is always smaller than the fracture height in mechanical isotropic formation, and the fracture tends to propagate (at least temporarily) along the bedding plane interfaces. Different bedding plane properties, including bedding plane dipping angle, permeability etc., also have strong influence on the predicted fracture height. We also consider fracture height growth in multi fracture schemes. The stress shadowing effects give rise to non-planar vertical growth and possible fracture branching. The simulations show that hydraulic fracture height growth is substantially restricted in laminated formations. This paper provides a framework for more realistic prediction of fracture height and fracture pattern evolution in laminated shale formations exhibiting mechanical anisotropy. "

                    "abstract": "Many studies have assessed microseismic (MS) interpretation, and its source mechanisms in hydraulically fractured shale wells. However, the ability to derive stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) and fracture geometry from MS data is still controversial. This is because MS events not only come from the induced main fractures of the current stage, but they also result from reactivation of natural fractures (NF) or faults, previous hydraulic fractures (HF), stratigraphic boundaries, or other operational noise. MS data of adjacent stages tend to overlap each other severely, masking the real SRV of the current stage. Simulated complex fracture networks using MS data always yield higher production results when compared to actual production. We address these issues with an efficient MS interpretation method. This method divides the MS events into three windows using an Excel-VBA program: the Pad Window, the Proppant Window, and the Closure Window. These windows are based on the fracture stimulation job record for each stage. The Closure Window includes only the events from the end of pumping until the end of shut-in of the current stage. During the Closure Window, i.e., shut-in time before flowback, leakoff into the formation matrix can cause micropores to enlarge, resulting in MS events with compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) and isotropic (ISO) sources (crack opening mechanisms). Leakoff can also cause slippage of pre-existing NF and result in MS events with double-couple (DC) source. These fractures are secondary fractures with potential to transport fluid and facilitate the induced major fractures. When all of the fluid leaks off at positions along the main fractures, the fracture will close, which may trigger MS events with CLVD and ISO source mechanisms. We extracted the MS events in the Closure Window and eliminated those events induced by previous stages, NF, and pumping noise. Thus, we reduced the MS cloud overlap of different stages and increased the accuracy of the inferred fracture geometry and SRV. Case applications on several shale wells were used to test this method. On the basis of the results, we suggest continued monitoring MS events after the end of proppant pumping. The method developed in this study can process any MS data and the associated fracture stimulation job data to segregate the three MS event windows. The Closure MS Window will indicate fracture geometry more accurately, and thus enhance optimization of hydraulic fracturing design and the prediction of hydrocarbon production. "

                    "abstract": "A new formulation of the wellbore-boundary condition in multiphase-reservoir simulation is suggested, allowing automatic determination of the direction of the flow at any time. It is particularly useful in coupled transient modeling of the liquid-loading phenomenon in gas wells. The traditional inflow-performance relationship (IPR) uses a common-wellblock productivity index (PI), but determines the inflow/outflow of the individual phases through a wellbore connection in an otherwise detached manner. The new approach takes into account that all phases should flow in the same direction and should have a common zero-flow condition. The restriction leads to the definition of a new state variable: the multiphase zero-flow pressure (MPZFP or P0). According to the new formulation, the flow direction at the connection is determined by the sign of the difference between this gridblock variable and the wellbore-flowing pressure. Advantages of the new formulation include that the flow is always cocurrent through a single connection (but multiple connections can lead to crossflow); that the meaning of wellblock PI is preserved; that the phase composition of the connection stream is determined by the upstream condition; that when wellbore pressure is far from the MPZFP, the traditional (detached) IPRs are recovered; and, last but not least, that previous numerical-convergence problems are completely eliminated during coupled dynamic simulation of the wellbore/reservoir system in the presence of significant capillary pressure. Examples illustrate the application of the new wellbore boundary condition in coupled modeling of the complex phenomena usually referred to as liquid loading. "

                    "abstract": "This work presents a new approach to account for variable matrix-block size in the well performance of unconventional shale reservoirs. In contrast to the standard models that consider either a fixed matrix-block size or a stochastic distribution of sizes with no particular dependence on the spatial location, in this model we consider the case when the characteristic length of the blocks depends on the distance from the main hydraulic-fracture plane. In particular, we assume that, as a result of the hydraulic-fracturing treatment, the density of microfractures (natural and induced) is high near the hydraulic-fracture face, but gradually decreases away from it. In other words, the matrix-block size is an increasing function of the distance from the fracture face. We show that the boost of the contact area between the matrix blocks and the microfractures can be the determinant feature of hydrocarbon production from shale reservoirs, even when the natural and induced microfractures do not have uniform density throughout the whole stimulated reservoir volume. In addition, the elongated linear flow (the consensus characteristic signature in the well performance of shale systems) may be the result of an induced interporosity flow when the matrix-/fracture-permeability ratio is small. The duration of this flow regime increases if the effective size of the matrix-block distribution increases. On the other hand, the linear flow can be the result of the total-system response when the matrix-/fracture-permeability ratio is high; in this case, the beginning of the linear flow is strongly affected by the small matrix blocks near the hydraulic-fracture faces. The resulting mathematical model in Laplace space has a fundamentally different structure compared with standard dual-porosity models because of the spatial dependence of the parameters characterizing the interporosity flow. In this work, we develop the Airy-spline scheme, a new technique to calculate the pressure solution in an efficient way. Closed-form approximate formulae in the time domain are also provided, revealing that during the induced linear-interporosity-flow period, the production behavior is controlled by the logarithmic mean of the minimum and maximum matrix-block size. A field example from the Barnett shale is presented to illustrate the use of the new model. "

This work focuses on situations of particular significance in natural gas producing wells, when annular to churn flow-pattern transition brings about drastic holdup increase, leading to a rich group of phenomena in the field, known as “liquid loading”. Under circumstances, believed to precede liquid loading, the still steady-state and stable liquid holdup may be several folds larger than the inlet volumetric fraction of the liquid, due to partial flow reversal. Standard two-phase correlations have difficulties in reproducing the observations in such situations. The proposed method is actually flow-pattern independent and relies on a measure of nearness of the flow condition to the specific condition when partial flow reversal starts to appear. Interestingly, the actual form of this correlation is quite simple, relying on the gas and liquid superficial velocities and mass fractions – in addition to the key parameter – the “critical” superficial gas velocity.

                    "abstract": "This work presents new solutions to modeling the production performance of hydraulically fractured wells in unconventional reservoirs, where intensive hydraulic fracturing creates a stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) with an induced permeability field within. We found previously that the permeability field induced in the SRV (single porosity) can be effectively represented by an exponential or linear dependence of permeability on the distance measured from the main hydraulic fracture plane. However, many researchers consider dual porosity as a necessary ingredient in modeling unconventional reservoirs. In this work, we extend the induced permeability field model to the dual porosity idealization, considering transient fluid transfer from matrix to natural fractures and distance-dependent properties of the medium of secondary porosity (affected by the intensive stimulation). We show that the combined effect of creating a main fracture and altering the properties of the medium of secondary porosity leads to a production behavior that can be characterized and understood provided that effects related to skin and varying flowing bottomhole pressure are correctly accounted for. In addition to the standard diagnostic tools for decline-curve or rate-transient analysis, we use the ratio between the production time and material balance time, a dimensionless group that enables identifying the characteristic signatures of flow regimes. We provide practical criteria to identify various scenarios affecting the data during the pre-linear and pre-bilinear flow regimes in the reservoir (short times). Then we show that transient, late transient and boundary dominated flow periods can also be diagnosed using the dimensionless group, providing a useful addition to existing procedures involving conventional plots. In connection to the new model, this work also discusses a novel approach to handle non-constant bottomhole pressure, the cause of significant distortion in production data at early times. In particular, we consider the effect of a bottomhole pressure exponentially approaching a stabilized value. We show that the deviation from the idealized constant bottomhole pressure case depends on the flow regime in the reservoir, fluid and reservoir properties, skin factor, and the mean lifetime (the time when 63% of the total change has happened) of the decaying part of the flowing pressure. The results reveal that half-, three-fourths-, and unit-slope straight lines (on log–log plot of production rate versus time) develop at short times during the increasing trend of production rate. These new flow regimes enable to gain useful information about the SRV from the early stage of the production history – if the quality of data allows such a detailed analysis. We present a field example involving multi-fractured horizontal wells producing from a shale-gas reservoir, to illustrate, in a practical manner, how to apply the new approach when interpreting production history of wells in unconventional reservoirs.

We consider the case when the hydraulic-fracturing operation--in addition to establishing the fundamental linear-flow geometry in the drainage volume--alters the ability of the formation to conduct fluids throughout, but with varying degrees depending on the distance from the main fracture plane. We show that, under these circumstances, the reservoir response departs from the uniform-permeability approach significantly. The new model differs from the once promising group of models that are inherently related to power-law-type variation of the permeability-area product and thus are burdened by a mathematical singularity inside the fracture. The analysis of field cases reveals that the induced permeability field can be properly represented by a linear or exponential function characterized by the maximal induced permeability k0 and the threshold permeability k*. Both these permeabilities are induced (superimposed on the formation) by the hydraulic-fracturing treatment; thus, the model can be considered as a simple, but nontrivial, formalization of the intuitive stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) concept. It is quite reasonable to assume that the maximum happens at the fracture face and that the minimum happens at the outer boundary of the SRV. The contrast between maximal and minimal permeability, SR-1/4-k0/k*, will be of considerable interest, and thus, we introduce a new term for it: stimulation ratio (SR). Knowledge of these parameters is crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of today’s intensively stimulated well completions, especially multifractured horizontal wells in shale gas.

For a multi-layered formation a more robust and more general approach is suggested in this work. First a range of admissible reference treating pressures is prepared. For each pressure level we determine the up-down tip locations and hence we obtain the fracture height map. Thus, there is a relationship between induced height and net pressure and this relationship can be calculated from Linear Elastic Fracture mechanics before the actual design optimization is carried out. According to the applicable fracture propagation model, for a given fracture half length, there exists a width and henceforth a net pressure. The ancillary height is a geometric byproduct. Matching the net pressure and height with the LEFM independently determined pair of height and net pressure results in a solution that satisfies both. The dimensionless productivity index, JD, is then calculated. For the fracture half lengths, ranging from a minimum (corresponding to aspect ratio one with respect to the perforated thickness) to a laterally fully penetrating fracture, we repeat the above procedure to calculate JD and so forth, until a maximum JD is accomplished. Introduction Fracture geometry optimization is a key to advance hydraulic fracture design. Traditional means to predict fracture geometry include: Two-dimensional (2D) models, Perkins, Kern and Nordgren (1961), (the \"PKN?? model); Khristianovitch and Zheltov, Geertsma and De-Klerk (1955), (the \"KGD?? model) and  the Radial or \"Penny-shape??

Three-dimensional (3D) and pseudo-3 dimensional (p-3D) models, such as the \"Cell?? approach, (Cleary 1994); overall fracture geometry parameterization and meshed full 3D models (Johnson et al., 1993) are also available. While a 2D model focuses on the fracture length and width by assuming a value for fracture height, the 3D and p-3D models attempt to predict height along with length and width (Gidley et al., 1979). For design purposes where the expected fracture geometry must result in the optimized fracture performance, Pitakbunkate (2011) used the Unified Fracture Design approach and extended it to a p-3D model in a three-layer lithology reservoir, predicting fracture height, half-length and width at the end of the fracture job. The present work has primarily focused on incorporating a multi-layered, p-3D, hydraulic fracture propagation model into the systematic design of a fracturing treatment for both oil and gas reservoirs. There are a number of considerations in optimizing fracture dimensions to maximize the production. The reservoir deliverability, well producing systems, fracture mechanics, fracturing fluid characteristics, proppant transport mechanism and operational constraints should be considered and integrated to achieve the physical optimization of the system. Incorporating economics in the design would maximize the benefits of a stimulation treatment. One drawback in the work of Pitakbunkate et al. 2011 by using a three-layer reservoir lithology is that some constraints are needed to ensure a solution, especially if the fracture height appears to \"run away?? in certain conditions.

A multi-layered p-3D approach to design is proposed integrating Unified Fracture Design (UFD), fracture propagation models and Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) relationship to generate optimized fracture geometry, including fracture height, width and half-length to achieve the maximized production. Containment layers are discretized to allow for plausible fracture heights when seeking convergence of fracture height and net pressure.  UFD sizes the fracture geometry to physically optimize the hydraulically fractured well performance. The Proppant Number is a correlating parameter, which in turn provides the maximum dimensionless productivity index (JD) corresponding to the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity, CfD. Once the latter is determined, the optimum fracture dimensions, i.e., fracture length and width, are set. However, UFD in its original form needs the ability to calculate the Proppant Number and that is possible only if fracture height is an input parameter and hence fraction of proppant ending up in the pay can be determined before the optimization.  PKN or KGD fracture propagation models in design mode provide basic treatment parameters to achieve a known target length and also associated net pressure. Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) relationship can be used to obtain fracture height associated to a given vertical pressure distribution via vertical stress profile and fracture toughness profile. This study considers the contributions of all layers to the stress intensity factor at the fracture tips to find the potential equilibrium height defined by the condition where the stress intensity factor minus fracture toughness difference changes sign (but not necessary becomes zero.)  After an equilibrium height and the corresponding net pressure are found, an optimization is carried out to find target length and a 2D design model is used to calculate treatment parameters, first of all net pressure. The ultimate goal is to find a consistent pair of these two different sub-models; when the assumed pressure condition in the LEFM part coincides with the resulting pressure condition from the UFD/2D part.

Our study proposes that the SEDM exponent parameter, n can be related to the scale independent characteristics of the created fracture network that in turn can be considered non-varying in a given field (or larger group of wells in the same geological settings and of similar completion type.) Our hypothesis is supported by dry gas flow simulation involving stochastic generation of DFN with various characteristics. The effect of variations in natural fracture lengths, apertures, density, and connectivity are considered along with induced hydraulic fracture dimensions. In view of our findings we present another conditioning approach to robust decline curve analysis and provide application examples for selected Barnett Shale wells.  Introduction Traditional DCA, developed by Arps (1945), is often not reliable enough to accurately predict the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) for unconventional oil and gas production forecasting. Arps family of equations was originally developed for production conditions that can be considered boundary-dominated in modern reservoir engineering terms. Boundarydominated flow occurs in medium-high permeability formations and usually the well reaches this regime in a short time. The behavior characteristics of the production history in tight-gas shale reservoirs can be and often are quite different. As a result, traditional DCA leads to unreasonable results.  The Stretched Exponential function, long used by applied physicists to model relaxation processes of various types, was introduced to the petroleum industry as an appropriate and reliable model for production rate decline in gas wells (Valkó et al., 2009 and 2010). Stretched Exponential decline model (SEDM) gives considerably more stabilized production forecast than the Arps model (with or without minimum terminal decline), and it has been shown to produce unchanging EUR forecasts after only two-three years of production data are available in selected reservoirs, notably the Barnett Shale.  One important aspect of Arps original concept of DCA is associated with the \"individual decline behavior?? recognizable from one well's data. Indeed, most publications focus on analysis of individual production data and show such illustrations of concepts. Several investigations suggested, however, that the decline characteristics are valid for a group of wells (Valko and Lee, 2010). The big question however is, whether one well's production data contains all the necessary information to extrapolate future behavior or some of the extrapolation should be \"conditioned?? on information gleaned from analysis of the field (group data). If field information is used, the question is in what form?  The dual porosity (DP) concept, first introduced by Warren and Root (1963), adds a second interacting continuum which reflects storage and permeability characteristics of fractured reservoirs. However, because DP approaches simplify connectivity and imply scale-dependent heterogeneity, they cannot effectively address the connectivity between natural fractures and induced hydraulic fractures and their interaction. The discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is geologically more realistic than DP model. Moreover, DFN models have many advantages over conventional dual porosity (DP) approaches, especially in heterogeneous reservoirs where the dominant flow mechanism is through the network of fractures rather than the reservoir matrix. The DFN approach is based on the stochastic modeling concept and therefore every realization of the discrete fracture network will produce different results. As such, the DFN-type modeling is not a direct competitor to DP reservoir models. Rather it provides an additional insight into the potential variability of production histories. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In 2002 we introduced the concept of Unified Fracture Design (UFD) as a coherent way to size the fracture geometry for the expressed purpose to physically optimize the well performance. We used the Proppant Number as a correlating parameter, which in turn provided the maximum dimensionless productivity index (JD) which corresponds to the optimum dimensionless fracture conductivity, CfD. Once the latter is determined, the fracture dimensions, i.e., fracture length and width, are set.  If one assumes the fracture height is known and constant then the calculation is simple and a 2D fracture propagation model can be used. However, fracture height is not constant throughout the fracture and it cannot be considered constant during execution, depending greatly on the net pressure and vice versa.  We are presenting here an iterative procedure where the fracture height is related to the net pressure. In the procedure, for any assumed net pressure, the fracture height, along with the mass of proppant and the permeabilities of the reservoir and the proppant, lead to the Proppant Number which in turn determines the desired length and width. A fracture propagation model, such as the PKN geometry for lateral growth, coupled with a changing fracture height, leads to the calculation of the net pressure which is compared with the one assumed. Convergence of the assumed and calculated net pressure is what is sought.  The design procedure presented here is for both oil and gas wells. The design also includes the calculation of required treating pressure and finally it incorporates economics for production enhancement optimization beyond the physical optimization using UFD. Comparison of the 2D to the p-3D results points to the need and importance of the p-3D in a large array of reservoirs.  Introduction In many hydraulically fractured wells, the actual well performance is quite different from the one predicted from fracture design. Hydrocarbons are produced below expectations and gas or water is produced from overlain or underlain formations because of undesirable inter-zonal communication. One obvious reason is that 2D fracture designs, with assumed constant fracture height, do not offer accurate estimation of fracture geometry. The final fracture height is an important parameter of the fracture design. Commonly, fracture height is assumed based on intuition or mere observation of well logs. Designed fracture geometry and pumping schedules corresponding to assumed but inaccurate fracture height are unreliable. In this paper, we use the concept of \"equilibrium height?? to obtain the fracture height and apply the Unified Fracture Design (UFD) for physically optimum fracture geometry determination; fracture half length and width.

                    "abstract": "The multiwell productivity index (MPI) concept can be used to predict the performance of a homogenous reservoir under various operational conditions. In this paper, based on the MPI approach, we develop a semi-analytical method to evaluate interwell connectivity in waterflood projects. At first, we rearrange the MPI formula to predict waterflood performance in a homogeneous reservoir. For such cases, we can predict the liquid rates, average reservoir pressures and injectors' bottomhole pressures (BHP) accurately, in fractions of a second. For the case of an actual heterogeneous formation, we use the injection and production data to estimate the proper influence matrix by minimizing the misfit between predicted and actual reservoir performance. Defining the heterogeneity matrix as the difference between the estimated influence matrix and the one obtained as the analytical solution for the homogenous formation, we depict the normalized interwell connectivity indices. By decoupling the effect of well locations and the changes in injection rate, producer's BHP and individual skin factors from the apparent connectivity, the connectivity indices obtained by this method solely represent the reservoir heterogeneity and possible anisotropy and hence allow improved information exchange with the geologist. Comparing to the other connectivity evaluation models, the connectivity indices obtained by this method are independent of operational conditions, such as possible shutting-in existing or adding additional injectors or producers, or converting one to the other — and hence are more suitable for decision making. A further advantage of the new method is the flexibility to incorporate additional information, e.g. injectors' BHP, into the analysis process. "

                    "abstract": "The method of distributed volumetric sources (DVS) has been applied to predict gas production from a horizontal well with multiple transverse fractures in a bounded reservoir. Combining the quasianalytical DVS method, which provides us with the opportunity to predict pressure and production behavior of complex well/fracture configurations, with non-Darcy flow in the fracture enables us to calculate the optimum configuration in terms of the number and dimensions of fractures per well for a certain amount of proppant of a given type. The method is applied to an example case of a tight gas reservoir to maximize the production performance of this complex well/fracture configuration. Comparing results with and without inclusion of the non-Darcy effect in the fracture shows that a decrease in production occurs because of non-Darcy flow in all cases. However, a systematic screening of a realistic set of well/fracture configurations reveals that the detrimental effect of non-Darcy flow can be substantially compensated for by selecting the right number of fractures and shifting the fracture dimensions in favor of thicker fractures. While a simultaneous decrease in optimum lateral (and vertical) extension is necessary, it has limited effect on productivity. The simplicity, robustness, and small computational demand of the model allow seamless integration with external economic and operational constraints, providing a tool to screen and optimize a large set of possible configurations most suited for the development of economically marginal fields. Modern drilling and completion technologies have now provided us the opportunity to design and implement complex well fracture configurations. These complex configurations are used mainly in development of economically marginal reserves, where nonfractured vertical wells would be uneconomical. Among the complex completion schemes of particular importance is the horizontal well completed with multiple transverse fractures. This completion scheme is now widely used in offshore and tight gas development projects. The main goal of this paper is to provide a practical tool for prediction of the pressure and productivity behavior of such completions. Development of the method of DVS and the formulation of the problem for the case of a horizontal well with multiple fractures are discussed. Because one of the main applications of this type of completion is in tight gas and the inertial effect for high-velocity gas flow is significant, in this work, the DVS method is implemented, taking into account the non-Darcy-flow effect in the fracture. A simple optimum search procedure is presented to achieve maximum production performance from a given amount of resources. The procedure is then applied to a tight-gas-field case, and it is demonstrated that, by selecting the right configuration, the detrimental effect of non-Darcy flow can be largely compensated for. "

                    "abstract": "Numerous studies have concluded that connectivity is one of the most important factors controlling success of improved oil recovery processes. Interwell connectivity evaluation can help identify flow barriers and conduits and provide tools for reservoir management and production optimization. The multiwell productivity index (MPI)-based method provides the connectivity indices between well pairs based on injection/production data. By decoupling the effects of well locations, skin factors, injection rates, and the producers' bottomhole pressures from the calculated connectivity, the heterogeneity matrix obtained by this method solely represents the heterogeneity and possible anisotropy of the formation. Previously, the MPI method was developed for bounded reservoirs with limited numbers of wells. In this paper, we extend the MPI method to deal with cases of large numbers of wells and open reservoirs. To handle open reservoirs, we applied some modifications to the MPI method by adding a virtual well to the system and by modifying the pore volume. We applied the modifications in two nonvolumetric systems where there was either a leaking zone or an isolated zone, and found the approaches using the virtual well could predict the reservoir performance accurately.  In cases with large numbers of wells, the required computational time to calculate the heterogeneity matrix may make the problem intractable. Therefore, we applied a model reduction strategy based on the location of the wells, called windowing. This technique ignores the parameters that have smaller effects on reservoir performance. We applied windowing to two cases with large numbers of wells (16 and 41 wells). We observed that, by selecting the proper window size, we can predict the reservoir performance accurately (R2 values greater than 99%) and decrease the CPU time up to a factor of 20 for the studied cases. The approaches described enabled us to provide realistic interpretations of interwell connectivity for complex cases where the simple MPI method would be difficult to apply. Integration of these approaches with the MPI method can quickly and efficiently model field data to optimize well patterns and flood parameters. Introduction Interwell connectivity evaluation determines how effectively two wells are connected to each other. This can provide useful information on reservoir heterogeneity and lead to better waterflood management. Analysis of injection and production data can be particularly useful for determining connectivity between well pairs, since flow rates are among the most common measurements made during field life. In the last two decades, several methods have been developed to analyze injection and production data and define parameters which evaluate the connectivity. Some of these connectivity parameters provide us with semi-quantitative insights to better understand the reservoir heterogeneity. For example, the correlation coefficient between the well pairs (Heffer et. al 1997; Jansen and Kelkar 1997; Refunjol and Lake, 1999) may help identify flow barriers or conduits between the well pairs. The correlation coefficient (r), however, is not fully quantitative, because if one well pair has coefficient r0 while another pair has 2r0, the latter pair is not necessarily twice ‘as connected' as the former pair.  Other, more fully quantitative parameters exist to assist us in waterflood management. For instance, l in the Albertoni and Lake Method (Albertoni and Lake 2003) and the Capacitance Model (CM) (Yousef et al. 2006; Kaviani et al. 2008; Sayarpour et al. 2009) not only gives a quantitative evaluation of the interwell heterogeneity but can be used to predict the waterflood performance. Such a connectivity parameter decouples the effect of injection rate from the data. Thus the connectivity parameter l will be independent of injection rate fluctuations. In cases where producer BHPs are available, the CM can also decouple the effect of pressure on l.  There are, however, non-reservoir effects which still affect l, such as the well spacing and skin factors.

                    "abstract": "This work combines two ideas—the stretched exponential decline curve model and the novel paradigm of data-intensive discovery—to provide a controlled production forecast for any individual tight gas/shale gas well on the basis of data gathered through parameter processing for a large group of wells.. Group production for a large number of wells follows stretched exponential decline behavior of production rates, which we model using the corresponding decline curve model. Compared to the Arps model, the new approach offers numerous advantages; the two most significant ones are the bounded nature of estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) without limits on time or rate, and the straight-line behavior of a recovery potential expression that we introduce. This approach moves production forecasts in tight and unconventional gas fields from individual and subjective curve matching to a new methodology we call \"group-data controlled forecast.?? In terms of the novel stretched exponential decline curve model, the combined process offers statistically more consistent reserve estimates and also provides a potential well monitoring tool. Introduction In 1923 Arnold, one of the first scientists to apply decline curve analysis wrote: \"Twenty years ago the estimate of oil reserves was computed generally by calculating the contents of the supposed reservoir rock from data regarding thickness, extent, etc., guessing at the saturation and percentage of recoverable oil, and finally arriving at a very rough approximation of the desired information. Now, thanks to the great mass of data available and to the perfection of methods of computation, we get more accurate results. If we know the production of a given well over a reasonable period (even a period of days in some instances), we can calculate with remarkable accuracy the future production of the well by years and in totality, and thus arrive at the recoverable reserve for this well and its surrounding area.?? Arps' (1945) seminal work shows that early research focused on three major issues: conditions necessary for past production to be a predictor for future performance, appropriate mathematical models to describe observed trends, and available methods to identify model parameters. In the following decades, additional questions appeared: how to incorporate reservoir engineering concepts, such as pseudosteady state, material balance, etc., to constrain the model parameters to a \"physically reasonable?? range (Fetkovich, 1980) and whether total lease or field analysis would give results different from individual well analysis (Shea et al., 1964). In the 80s it was inevitable to apply hyperbolic decline to tight gas wells, and it soon turned out that the data are less amenable to straightforward application of the hyperbolic model (see, for example, Maley, 1985).Unconventional gas applications even amplified the problem, as reported frequently in the literature (Spivey et al., 2001; Rushing et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2008;  Ilk, 2008.) To some extent the various resolution attempts have come full circle: restriction of the parameter space, adjustment of the fitting criteria, modification of the parameter search procedure, combination with mechanistic (physics-based) reservoir modeling, all of which already had some roots in the pre-1945 literature (Lewis and Beal, 1918; Cutler, 1924; Larkey, 1925; Johnson and Bollens,1927.)

Of particular interests are the closure models for interphase forces which often hinder the reliable prediction of the homogeneous flow regime. This article presents a multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study of bubbles in homogeneous porous media to model the flow of oil and gas, and investigates a closure model that is based on the Allen-Cahn phase-field method, where the capillary stress is derived from the excess free-energy. The governing dynamics is simulated with the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations extended for multiphase flow in porous media. The equations have been discretized by a wavelet transform method to accurately capture the topological change of the fluid-fluid interface. To validate the closure model for interphase forces, the results of the present phase-field method have been compared with that from experiments, as well as from reference numerical models. An excellent agreement among the results from present phase-field simulations, experiments, and some reference numerical simulations has been observed. The terminal velocity of the rising gas bubble in a liquid saturated porous medium, as well as in a pure liquid has been investigated. The bubble rising velocity in both cases have been compared with respect to the theoretical and experimental results. The study illustrates how the bubble dynamics in porous media depend on the excess free energy of a thin interfacial layer formed by two immiscible fluids. "

Therefore, a better understanding of damage mechanisms for various reservoir conditions can lead to optimize oil recovery rate. "

The CFD model solves the fundamental governing equations of fluid dynamics, namely, the continuity, momentum and energy equations. Several built-in sub-models are used to capture the characteristics of pool fire. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equation for turbulence and the eddy-dissipation model for non-premixed combustion are used. For thermal radiation, the Monte Carlo (MC) radiation model is used with the Magnussen soot model. The CFD results are compared with a set of experimental data for validation; the results are consistent with experimental data. CFD results show that the wind speed has significant contribution on the behavior of pool fire and its domino effects. The radiation contours are also obtained from CFD post processing, which can be applied for risk analysis. The outcome of this study will be helpful for better understanding of the domino effects of pool fire in complex geometrical settings of process industries. "

Many models and correlations have appeared over decades handling multiphase flow through surface chokes. But, direct comparison of their relative performance has been a few, if any. This study evaluates several models and correlations to explore their relative performances. As expected, models anchored in thermodynamic principles outperformed others. Improvements in modeling followed the initial findings. We studied several models to explore their relative merits and ease of use in field settings. Seven different data sets gathered from laboratory and field settings, involving about 1000 independent data points, constituted the essence of this study. The study found the importance of PVT data in any flow through choke calculations. Specifically, we found that changes in density and heat capacity of fluids with pressure and temperature should be part of any rigorous effort for computation of flow rates. To ensure reliability and consistency in solutions, a model based on thermodynamic considerations deserve preference for generalized applications because it can handle pressure and temperature-dependent fluid properties. In this context, the recognition of choke-discharge coefficient's dependence on flow rate and Reynolds number constitutes an important element in ensuring the reliable outcome of results. "

Accounting for this nonisothermal flow behavior becomes a necessity for accurately estimating a well's performance due to changes in fluid properties. This paper starts with the general energy balance in the reservoir and presents a semianalytical solution to estimate the nonisothermal, single-phase gas temperature in the reservoir during production. This solution considers the J-T effect, adiabatic expansion effect, transient temperature behavior, heat convection, and heat exchange of fluid with over and under-burden formation. The variations of gas viscosity, density, J-T coefficient as a function of temperature and pressure are taken into consideration by making a small spatial step at each computational node.

Distributed temperature measurements or DTS during a drillstem test (DST) made this validation feasible. The J-T effect dominates in the near wellbore region due to dramatic pressure change. The J-T induced cooling usually occurs for gas in the reservoir. However, for high-pressure systems, the gas behaves like a liquid and gets heated up. For some intermediate pressure intervals, the gas temperature slightly increases with expansion, reach a plateau, and then gradually decreases as the gas moves toward the wellbore with declining pressure.

The dynamic interaction between wellbore and reservoir when liquid loading happens cannot be comprehensively simulated by a single wellbore simulator or a single reservoir simulator.

We fully couple a wellbore model with an in-house reservoir simulator based on the control-volume finite-difference method. Wellbore transient material-balance equations and mixture momentum-balance equations are solved simultaneously with the reservoir equations to obtain pressure, mixture velocity, and phase holdup in each wellbore segment. Also, we propose a modified drift-flux model that is capable of predicting the flow-regime transition for different pipe inclinations from vertical to horizontal. The modified drift-flux model is integrated in the coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator to characterize the two-phase flow in horizontal wellbores. We validate the coupled wellbore/reservoir model with a commercial multisegment wellbore (MSW)/reservoir simulator. The revised drift-flux formulation not only matches a commercial simulator in production forecast and wellbore pressure, but also predicts the subsequent unstable liquid production caused by flow-regime transitions. For a synthetic field-scale case, the new model predicts gas production that lasts 23 days longer than the prediction of a commercial simulator. This paper extends the capability of a fully implicitly coupled wellbore/reservoir simulator to simulate the transient liquid-loading phenomenon. The model can serve as a promising tool for gasfield development. "

Our primary outcome is to assess the stone free rate after the first session. The secondary goal is to assess the operative outcome and the associated postoperative complications. Finally, 57 children were completed the treatment and follow up; 27 patients in F-URS group and 30 patients in ESWL group. Patient's demographics and stone characteristics were comparable between both groups. F-URS group was associated with significantly longer operative time and hospital stay versus ESWL group. Overall complications occurred in 29.6% and 33.3% in F-URS groups and ESWL group, respectively (p value = 0.1) and most of them were of minor degree.

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading has been an issue for mature gas wells due to declining reservoir energy. In older fields, one of the methods used to mitigate this problem is plunger lift. However, the optimum design of a plunger lift is nontrivial. This paper presents a simplified modeling approach for the design of plunger lift for wells in gas reservoirs with significant water production. The proposed model allows for an efficient design of plunger lift by incorporating energy balance in the wellbore. The wellbore/reservoir model presupposes the presence of some liquid in the tubing and in the tubing/casing annulus, but most of the tubing and annular space is assumed to be filled with gas. Closure of the tubinghead valve initiates recuperation of reservoir energy, thereby allowing fluid influx to occur in the tubing and annulus. Eventually, accumulation of sufficient pressurized gas in the annulus lifts the plunger along with the liquid and gas on top of it. The model accounts for the pressure-volume (pV) work done by the pressurized gas in the annulus, including the energy needed to lift the liquid and gas on top of the plunger, and friction during the plunger movement. Because the dimensions and trajectory of the wellbore have such profound impact on the operability of plunger lift, operators can use this model by just providing the known input parameters to determine the design variables, target casing pressure, and duration of the plunger cycle.

This paper uses numerical model to analyze rising process of sustained casing pressure and study how cement sealed integrity is damaged, finally controlling sustained casing pressure by improving cement properties. Cement sealed integrity collapse is one of the main reasons of sustained casing pressure, which distributes widely in high-pressure gas fields and gas storage reservoirs. First, numerical model is built according to volume consistency and mass conservation law to study rising process of sustained casing pressure. This model cam also clarify the relationship between sustained casing pressure and cement sealed integrity. And then a nonlinear equation set is established to study the mechanism of cement sealed integrity collapse. This equation set is based on Culon-Morper rule and stress-displacement continuity law. It can calculate micro annulus caused by wellbore pressure change. Lastly, a numerical model is built to predict the sustained casing pressure caused by micro annulus. Through this model, the influencing law of every factor is analyzed to find effective measures to mitigate sustained casing pressure and improve cement sealed integrity. The numerical calculation indicates that pressure rising period becomes shorter as cement micro annulus increases. Micro annulus happens when tensile force exceeds cement bonding strength. Optimizing the cement Poisson's ratio, and elasticity modulus can prevent micro annulus. Meanwhile, the casing internal pressure change should be controlled and cement bonding strength must be increased. It can inhibit micro annulus by using self-healing cement, casing sand adhesion and expansion casing, thus preventing sustained casing pressure. The optimization of cement top can permanently control sustained casing pressure. "

The model was able to capture important quantitative phenomena associated with the wellbore-heat transmission (e.g., lithologic column and annulus-fluid type).

Considering the drilling safety and basic demand of hole cleaning, define length of horizontal well as extreme hydraulic extension length when the drilling fluid pump rate is equal to minimum cutting-carry pump rate and hole cleaning satisfied basic demand. Based on this concept, a prediction model is established according to the relationship among minimum cutting-carry pump rate, bottomhole pressure, circulation pressure loss and drilling pump pressure. This model considers the influence of cuttings on the hydrostatic column pressure, horizontal annular pressure drop and annular geometrical shape. And then this model is used to analyze the impact of well structure, formation property, drilling fluid property, hole cleaning degree and drilling parameters on extreme hydraulic extension length. On the above basis, a new index called ration of dispersion coefficient is introduced to evaluate the sensitivity of each factor. The sensitivity decreases as the sequence of cutting particle size, drilling fluid flow behavior index, acceptable cutting bed height, wellbore diameter, ROP(8-15 m/h), drilling fluid density, drilling string eccentricity, formation fracture pressure, drilling fluid consistency index, well vertical depth and ROP(1-8 m/h).

The basis of this method is constituted by modeling the physical fluid-flow phenomenon from the reservoir to discharge point and accounting for distribution of uncertainties of various independent variables. Our model couples the gas/oil two-phase flow in a wellbore with a reservoir in deepwater settings. Unsteady-state reservoir depletion coupled with changes in flow patterns in the wellbore are implicit in this analytical modeling approach. We validated the model with various published results related to Gulf of Mexico's Macondo oil spill in a probabilistic frame. Overall, combining the physical model with distributions of uncertain parameters enabled us to depict the risk picture of the uncontrolled wellbore flow events. This approach led to volumetric estimation of the spilled volume. The statistical design of experiments aided in the analysis of the discharged volume range assessed by others in the Macondo case study. The results suggest that good agreement is in hand when compared with the previous deterministic solutions. "

A casing is developed to mitigate trapped annular pressure with low cost and overcome the limitation of well structure and location. This casing consists of coupling, relief valve, inner wall, relief space and outer wall. It can increase annular volume change rate by using relief valve to connect trapped annulus and casing relief space. Higher annular volume change rate can reduce or even eliminate trapped annular pressure. To prove the feasibility and optimize parameters of mitigation casing, models are built to calculate trapped annular pressure and annular temperature change of multiple annuli. The analysis indicates mitigation casing can effectively and permanently reduce trapped annular pressure. The extreme annular pressure change and pressure in case well are as high as 120.02 °C and 139.74 MPa, but annular pressure no longer exists when 36 mitigation casings are installed. Optimal number of mitigation casing is determined by annular temperature change and mitigation objective. Suitable design can reduce the number of mitigation casing while maintain strong mitigation effect. Mitigation casing number of case well is reduced 27.27% after optimization. "

                    "abstract": "Offshore operations have always been very challenging due to technological and operational complexities in combination with harsh environmental conditions. Geological uncertainties, high pressure flammable fluids in the presence of ignition sources, complicated structural layouts, limited response time allowance, difficulty of control and communication are some of the critical factors that pose clear threats toward safe operations and may result in high consequence events, e.g., blowouts. Developing well specified risk indicators is difficult due to such highly correlated factors and multifaceted operations. Leading indicators, which are able to identify critical events that could lead to high consequence events, have proven to be an effective tool that can help the operators in their decision making to react earlier to an event and to reduce the risk of an incident. Most of the research dedicated to leading and lagging indicators are applicable to the petrochemical industry, and there is not yet an agreement on a definition and classification of leading indicators for drilling related blowouts. This paper discusses the approaches of different organizations and institutes on leading indicators characterization and development. The drilling industry is compared with the aviation industry to identify potential elements for developing a comprehensive leading indicators framework. A workable definition of leading indicators is proposed considering the intricacy of offshore operations. Leading indicators are broadly categorized into two classes which are further segmented into different groups. Proposed categorization is analyzed with a blowout case study and simple decision support algorithms are proposed for predicting kick which is a major precursor to blowouts. "

In mature fields, one of the methods used to mitigate this problem is plunger lift. However, the design of plunger lift may still question the premise of optimization. This paper presents a new model for the design of plunger lift for wells in gas reservoirs with significant water production. The proposed model allows for an efficient design of plunger lift by incorporating physics of fluid flow in the wellbore. The wellbore/reservoir model presupposes presence of some liquid in the tubing and in the tubing/casing annulus, but most of the tubing and annular space is assumed to be filled with gas. Closure of the tubinghead valve initiates recuperation of reservoir energy, thereby allowing fluid influx to occur in the tubing and annulus. Eventually, accumulation of sufficient pressurized gas in the annulus lifts the plunger along with the liquid and gas on top of it. The model accounts for the pressure-volume (pV) work done by the pressurized gas in the annulus, including the energy needed to lift the liquid and gas on top of the plunger, and friction during the plunger movement. Because the dimensions and trajectory of the wellbore have such profound impact on the operability of plunger lift, operators can use this model by just providing the known input parameters to determine the design variables, target casing pressure and duration for the plunger cycle.

The crush of crude price has pushed the operators toward cost-cutting plans. Such plans, in short terms, may significantly reduce the exploration and operation costs and relieve financial pressures. On the other hand, such measures may also compromise the balance among safety, reliability and cost in the long term and potentially lead to catastrophic accidents. The current regulation in the Gulf of Mexico region requires the operators to report a single value for the worst-case discharge (WCD) during a possible blowout. However, it does not provide any additional value to manage risk of uncontrolled wellbore flow event and the impact to the marine environment. In this paper, a practical and comprehensive oil spill risk assessment method is introduced. It couples the reservoir/wellbore models and distribution of uncertainties to depict the risk picture of uncontrolled wellbore flow events. Statistical design of experiments is conducted to determine important uncertainties to the blowout risk. As shown by sensitivity analysis, this method can guide the operators to allocate limited resources to the important barriers and make proper risk reduction plans, so that the blowout risks are effectively controlled.

Short-duration tests may be a promising alternative to conventional DSTs for learning formation conductivity, but they should not be restricted to exploratory wells. Short-duration tests can have a profound impact in any deepwater field-development setting. Stakes are high when unfavorable productivity and injectivity indices change the well count calculus. Tools such as formation testers provide a credible alternative, but closed-chamber tests (CCT) and/or slug tests are also helpful for situations in which large volumes of formation fluid are sampled. Given that short-duration tests (CCT and slug) can last only a few minutes—particularly in high-conductivity reservoirs—we approached the challenge with a two-fold strategy. First, we developed a forward model to design the chamber length to ensure that we collected interpretable test data. Second, we combined the CCT and slug tests so that we could control the total test duration, particularly in high-conductivity reservoirs. The approach presented here allowed individual treatment of slug, CCT, and reverse-slug or injection test for underpressured reservoirs. Overall, the model presents a simple, yet complete approach to design and analysis of these short-term tests. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading is the inability of a producing gas well to remove its coproduced liquids from the wellbore. The liquid flowing as droplets or film accumulates at the well bottom, thereby imposing backpressure at the sandface and triggering increasingly higher pressure loss in the wellbore. The problem initiated by liquid loading is manifested in terms of loss in well deliverability, causing the wellhead pressure to decline significantly, which, in turn, leads to the cessation of gas production. Accordingly, the liquid-loading issue reduces the ultimate recovery of a gas well. Both the droplet-flow reversal and liquid-film-flow reversal have been postulated to be the underlying mechanism for liquid loading. Both mechanisms are predominantly premised on diagnosing the problem at the wellhead-flow conditions. This study explores the deliquefication issue in a gas well by fluid- and heat-flow modeling of the entire wellbore for a variety of flow situations in gas and gas/condensate reservoirs. We observed that when a well experiences annular two-phase flow throughout the wellbore, no liquid loading occurs. The transition from annular flow to churn or slug flow initiates the liquid-film-flow or droplet-flow reversal, thereby triggering liquid loading. Most often, the flow condition at the well bottom controls the onset of liquid loading. By use of three published data sets, we show that the understanding of liquid loading improves when the entire wellbore-flow modeling is used. Forward modeling suggests that the tubing inside diameter and the well productivity index are the most important independent variables in determining the critical liquid-loading rate and the onset of liquid loading.

Proactive testing is a way to minimize costly interventions. Accordingly, nonintrusive test procedures have emerged. For example, tests entailing monitoring of annular transient-pressure response can establish a GLV’s integrity by avoiding valve retrieval for inspection. This study details the development of a forward model that helps design methodology for GLV testing. The model recommends drawing down the annular gas to develop a positive pressure differential to allow fluid flow from the tubing into the annulus through the suspected GLV. This drawdown (DD) is followed by a pressure-buildup (BU) test. These pressure-transient tests allow the determination of the integrity and extent of GLV damage. The forward model also allows the estimation of the time needed for each segment of the transient-test sequence, thereby helping to schedule such tests at a certain operational frequency. "

In this study, a model is presented for a well producing from multiple reservoir sections to estimate flow contribution of each reservoir section using temperature and pressure measurements. The production from a well is modeled as a series of producing (vertical flow along with radial flow from a producing reservoir section) and non-producing (only vertical flow through the production tubing) zones. In addition to the sand face temperature measurements, surface temperature, total surface flow rate as well as pressure and temperature measurements in the producing tubing are used as input to the model. The temperature measurements in non-producing sections are critical to quantify flow from producing sections. These measurements are used to obtain thermal properties of the reservoir and particularly useful to quantify error in the flow rate estimates obtained from the model. The presented model can be adapted to any well producing from multiple reservoir sections. The temperature data can be used to diagnose problems with producing zones as well as identify locations of producing and non-producing zones as the well continues production. The model can also help determine the location as well as the number of temperature and pressure sensors required to estimate flow rates from individual reservoir sections in a specified error range. This is particularly useful for reservoir sections, which are difficult to characterize. The sensors along with the model have the potential to become an integral part of production monitoring for reservoir management. "

When such accidents take place, the total discharge of hydrocarbons becomes the focal point for all concerned, including the operator, the service provider, and the regulatory body. Rate estimation becomes a daunting task with scant information about the formation and fluids at the time of the accident. Given that new regulatory guidelines require such estimates for any offshore drilling, systematic investigation is imperative. This study presents an analytical model coupling the flow in a reservoir/wellbore system of a gas well. The model considers flow in the tubing, annulus and riser, and the attendant heat transfer in this formulation/wellbore system. To gauge safety concerns, a commercially available plume dispersion model is used to examine consequences of a blowout under various wind speed scenarios in the absence of any ignition source. In the event of gas ignition, the energy of the explosion of the flammable gas is estimated with an empirical method in terms of trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalency. The energy released by the jet fire associated with flammable gas is also evaluated. Two published field cases provided insight into the model's applicability in actual situations and some perspective on solution quality. However, given the large number of unknowns in any setting, we adopted the statistical design of experiments to understand the impact of independent variables. These variables include formation permeability, connected reservoir pore-volume, and restrictions in flow path, among others. Overall, the model results are in agreement with the previous findings. Specifically, we observed that reservoir permeability controls the flow rate; hence, the cumulative production for a given flow cross-sectional area in the well. In addition, the reservoir pore-volume connected to the well has a large impact on the rate of production decline; therefore, the total discharge volume. "

Comparing and contrasting permeability estimates from the two periods provides guidance on the suitability of this approach. To that end, this study compares and contrasts rate computation with analytical methods. The new methods entail transient-temperature modeling with and without superposition effects.

The value of early-time production data monitoring may be overlooked for two reasons: first, transients may be difficult to interpret because of two-phase flow in the formation; second, two-phase flow metering becomes a requirement. The objective of this study is two-fold: to estimate rate from distributed-temperature sensor (DTS) data available for downhole telemetry with a rigorous transient analytical model, and to use the computed rates to perform transient analysis for both the pre- and post-cleanup periods. Comparing and contrasting permeability estimates from the two periods provides guidance on the suitability of this approach. To that end, this study compares and contrasts rate computation with analytical methods. The new methods entail transient-temperature modeling with and without superposition effects. Two field examples strengthened the new rate-computation methods introduced here, and simulated examples probed the possibility of extracting meaningful information from the cleanup data. Introduction Investigators have studied near-wellbore formation damage from various angles over the years because near-wellbore properties are altered by the drilling operation itself and by the invasion of mud and its filtrate because of over-balanced drilling. From the standpoint of transient-pressure testing, Larsen and Kviljo (1990) and Larsen et al. (1990) investigated the analysis of cleanup data. In these studies, the authors explored the variable-skin concept en route to establishing the attainment of cleanup. They showed with field data that the derived skin declines in a hyperbolic fashion in conventional tests. Stated differently, production of the invaded mud filtrate declines hyperbolically. This finding showed the diminishing influence of the unwanted phase with time. Systematic studies, wherein similar tests are run, have evolved in understanding the variable skin in wireline-formation testing (but at a much reduced scale of producing rate and time). The studies of Goode and Thambynagyam (1996), Alpak et al. (2008), Ramaswami et al. (2012), among others, are cases in point. As expected, declining skin turned out to be the norm. Clarkson et al. (2013) observed evolution of skin evolution in coal-bed methane wells. The authors coined the term dynamic-skin ratio, which was included in the dimensionless type-curve variables and flowing-material-balance formulation, to include the effect of changing skin. More recently, Theuveny et al. (2013) explored various nuances of near-wellbore and wellbore cleanup operation with a transient multiphase wellbore simulator coupled with a reservoir-flow simulator. DTS has shown significant potential with various forms of testing and analysis. For instance, Duru and Horne (2010) used DTS data for estimating formation parameters, such as permeability and porosity during transient testing. Wang et al. (2008) presented an inverse model for real-time flow profiling based on steady-state energy balance with DTS measurements. Muradov and Davies (2011) illustrated the use of DTS measurements to compute fractional contribution of production zones and pressures in the wellbore. Tardy et al. (2012) demonstrated the use of distributed measurements during fluid injection to quantify the intake profile of treatment fluid along the wellbore.  In conventional DSTs, Kabir et al. (2014) recently showed the application of the distributed temperature data in rate estimation for the stable flow periods. Although both the transient-temperature signature and its superposition effects in the previous work were neglected for simplicity, good rate solutions within engineering accuracy were obtained nonetheless.

                    "title": "Assessing Integrity of the Gas-Lift Valves by Analyzing Annular Pressure-Transient Response",
                    "abstract": "By definition, gas-lift valves (GLVs) are designed to allow influx of the annular gas into the tubing and prevent any backflow, even when there is a pressure differential toward the annulus. However, elements such as erosion, corrosion, scale, fatigue, vibration, and temperature and pressure effects may cause the GLV to leak, thereby posing a serious safety issue. Because of the well integrity concern, suspected GLVs are often retrieved for inspection with a wireline from the side-pocket mandrel. Proactive testing is a way to minimize such costly intervention. This paper details a methodology for determining a GLV’s integrity that avoids retrieving the valve and relies on examining the annular transient-pressure response. Based on the models that have been developed, we propose a robust, nonintrusive test procedure that can save both time and expense. This proposed method has been partially validated with field data from three offshore wells.  Introduction The use of gas-lift technology dates back to the 1940s. Recently, Decker (2008) provided some insights into modern design and the use of injection pressure-operated GLVs. Accurate models are also available for calculating critical flow rate across Venturi valves, especially for high-pressure gas-lift systems, as proposed by Almeida (2011). Given the widespread use of gas-lift as an artificial-lift mechanism, the integrity of GLV is of great interest to the industry. Accordingly, some operators (Xu et al. 2012 and Carlsen et al. 2010) have taken proactive measures to ensure GLV safety, beyond those measures suggested by the API recommended guidelines (1999, 2008, 2010). To improve well safety, Gilbertson et al. (2013) offered a passive, thermally actuated safety valve for offshore wells. The use of artificial intelligent agents, such as the one described by Stephenson et al. (2010), to diagnose the lift system has significantly helped manage data gathering, interpretation, and subsequent actions. Models have also been offered to design and analyze flow instability; the studies of Poblano et al. (2005), Blick et al. (1988), and Asheim (1988) are cases in point. More recently, Garcia (2013), Eikrem et al. (2008), and others have offered stability analysis when cyclic variations in pressure and production rates occur, resulting in significant disturbances to the downstream processing facility. Despite the long operational history of the gas-lift system, methods for testing GLV integrity appear to be limited in the open literature. This paper attempts to provide some insights into model development and interpretation of field data. Specifically, this study presents a methodology for estimating the influx of tubing liquid across the GLV into the annulus by drawing down the annular gas and the subsequent buildup of pressure that is measured at the casinghead. These two tests, drawdown followed by a buildup of the annular pressure, allow estimation of the liquid leakage rate independently, thereby instilling confidence in the solutions. To examine the integrity of GLVs, a number of tests were run on three wells. These tests included gathering acoustic-well sounding (AWS) data for annular liquid level and casinghead pressure at various times in accord with current field practice in an offshore setting. We used these data to validate the models developed in this study. These models are predicated upon the use of a mechanical energy-balance equation for estimating annular pressure and thermodynamic relations for estimating the annular gas temperature. Computations showed that the use of both the constant geothermal gradient and polytropic expansion/compression yielded comparable solutions. "

                    "abstract": "Despite multitier safeguards in any drilling operation, blowouts occur. When such accidents take place, the total discharge of hydrocarbons becomes the focal point for all concerned, including the operator, the service provider, and the regulatory body. Rate estimation becomes a daunting task with scant information about the formation and fluids at the time of the accident. Given that new regulatory guidelines require such estimates for any offshore drilling, systematic investigation is imperative. This study presents an analytical model coupling the flow in a reservoir/wellbore system of a gas well. The model considers flow in the tubing, annulus and riser, and the attendant heat transfer in this formulation. To gauge safety concerns, plume dispersion is modeled under various wind speed scenarios when ignition sources were not present. In the event of gas ignition, the energy of the explosion of the flammable gas is estimated with an empirical method in terms of trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalency. The energy released by the jet fire associated with flammable gas is also evaluated. Two published field cases provided insight into the model’s applicability in actual situations and some perspective on solution quality. However, given the large number of unknowns in any setting, we adopted the statistical design of experiments to understand the impact of independent variables. These variables include formation permeability, connected reservoir pore-volume, and restrictions in flow path, among others. Overall, the model results are in agreement with the previous findings. Specifically, we observed that reservoir permeability controls the flow rate; hence, the cumulative production for a given flow cross-sectional area in the well. In addition, the reservoir pore-volume connected to the well has a large impact on the rate of production decline; therefore, the total discharge volume. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the use of a model to predict sustained casing pressure (SCP), from early pressure buildup data, as a basis for inherently safer well integrity testing. Inherently safer principles aim to eliminate or reduce the hazards by design rather than by using protective features. SCP, a well integrity issue exhibited in many wells, is any measurable pressure that rebuilds after being bled down and attributable to causes other than artificially applied pressure or temperature fluctuations in the well. Intrusion of gas, resulting in SCP, can occur because of poor cement bond in the casing or cement deterioration. Gas entering the annulus migrates to the wellhead and represents a hazard due to increased wellhead pressure and the gas inventory. Compromised well integrity can have catastrophic consequences on both environmental and safety aspects. Most regulations require the monitoring, testing and, eventually, the elimination of SCP. However, test data analysis is predominantly qualitative and limited to arbitrary criteria. Due to the high percentage of wells that present SCP, accurate, safe and preferably fast testing methods are needed. This paper implements an analytical model, rooted in the transport processes and thermodynamics of the system, to predict pressure profiles and gas accumulation during SCP testing from early-time pressure buildup data. The amount of gas accumulated during different testing criteria, being 1) current practices and 2) early diagnostic by the analytical model, is calculated and compared. Results show that using the analytical model as a predictive tool, testing time is reduced significantly, thereby limiting the amount of gas accumulated and reducing the risk. This makes the testing procedure inherently safer as well as less time consuming. "

                    "abstract": "Diagnostic fracture-injection testing (DFIT) has gained widespread usage in the evaluation of unconventional reservoirs. DFIT entails injection of water above the formation-parting pressure, followed by a long-duration pressure-falloff test. This test is a pragmatic method of gaining critical reservoir information (e.g., the formation-parting pressure, fracture-closure pressure, and initial- reservoir pressure), leading to fracture-completion design and reservoir-engineering calculations. In typical field operations, pressure is measured at the wellhead, not at the bottom of the hole, because of cost considerations. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) is obtained by simply adding a constant hydrostatic head of the water column to the wellhead pressure (WHP) at each timestep. Questions arise whether this practice is sound because of significant changes in temperature that occur in the wellbore, leading to changes in density and compressibility throughout the fluid column. This paper explores this question and offers an analytical model for estimating the transient temperature at a given depth and timestep for computing the BHP. Furthermore, on the basis of the premise of a line-source well, we have shown that the early-time data can be represented by the square-root of time formulation, leading to the new modified Hall relation for the injection period.

This paper attempts to provide a theoretical frame and a model for quantitative analysis of SCP-test data. Specifically, we adapted a model for SCP that is rooted in the transport processes of the system. The model accounts for mud compressibility and assumes gas is leaking into the annulus and migrating up the annular liquid column. Some robust assumptions about the transport processes allow for expressing the governing equation as a first-order, linear differential equation that is solved with appropriate boundary conditions. The resulting algebraic expression for the casing-pressure rise (Annulus A) with time is easy to apply. A comparison of the performance of the model with field data suggests that gas influx causes a casing-pressure (Annulus A) increase in wells. "

The experimental results showed that capacitance of (LC–CNTs) cell became higher than that of pure LC cell. The dielectric permittivity is determined as a function of applied frequency (100 Hz to 100 kHz) at voltage (5 V); it is found that increasing concentration of CNTs (0.1 wt.%) led to increase in the real part dielectric constant and decrease in imaginary part for (LC–CNTs) cell compared with the pure liquid crystal. Also conductivity of (LC–CNTs) cell was increased with increasing concentration of CNTs more than 0.05 wt.%. Theoretical study was carried out by using PM3 method for stable geometries of a nematic liquid crystal molecule of MBBA assembled parallel on a molecule of single-walled carbon nanotube (CNT). The result showed that the interaction caused by π,π-stacking between MBBA molecule and the wall of CNT and that may lead to formation of the local short range orientation order by LC molecules on the surface of the CNT.

This study provides a methodology wherein both the total and individual layer rates can be computed independently with DTS, completion, tubular, and other related data. To do the entire suite of calculations, a wellbore model handling steady fluid flow and unsteady-state heat transfer estimates a production rate, given wellhead pressure and temperature. The same model is then used to compute the flow profile based on measured DTS data across the producing intervals. The model rigorously accounts for various thermal properties of the fluid and the formation, including Joule–Thompson (JT) heating or cooling. Examples from both gas and oil wells are shown to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.

Two synthetic cases probed issues pertaining to average-reservoir pressure computation with the pseudosteady-state (PSS) approach, and two field examples validated the approach presented here.  Introduction Real-time data gathering in a new field development setting is the norm, particularly those in offshore or in difficult terrains in onshore environments. Many papers chronicle the benefits of such data collection and the consequent advantages of managing an asset. Some of the papers describing such benefits are those of Baker (2005) and Jemmott (2005), among others, for conventional reservoirs. Unconventional reservoirs are outside the scope of this study. Horne (2007) summarized many of the technical benefits of surveillance. Studies providing operational guidance from surveillance and implementation of the notion of digital oilfield are many; those of Shyeh et al. (2008) and Maskeri et al. (2008) are noteworthy. Gilbert et al. (2009) presents a method for evaluating the intrinsic value of sensing in an objective fashion in various reservoir settings. Some of the information that can be learned from such surveillance includes GIIP, the current gas-in-place, drainage volume associated with each producer, average-reservoir pressure, and the remaining reserves.  Recent papers of Ismadi et al. (2010) and Kabir et al. (2010) showed how reservoir management became feasible by deriving the necessary information with a set of analytical tools in an onshore field. Four independent analytical methods corroborated the in-place volume calculations. These methods include transient-PI (Medeiros et al. 2010), dynamic materialbalance (Agarwal et al. 1999), static-material balance, and rate-transient analysis (Palacio and Blasingame 1993). Kabir et al. (2010) also showed a graphical method for combining the static and dynamic material-balance methods, which instills confidence in solution quality.  The purpose of this study is to explore the merits of combined presentation of the static and dynamic methods on the same graph. In this context, we compare and contrast the \"flowing?? material-balance method, originally proposed by Mattar and McNeil (1998) for the constant-rate case and by Mattar et al. (2005) for the variable-rate case, with that proposed by Agarwal et al. (1999). Given that many gas wells are pressure-instrumented at the wellhead, this study also probes the suitability of wellhead pressure conversion in presence or absence of Joule-Thomson (J-T) cooling, leading to analysis with the converted-bottomhole pressures. In this context, we show that rate computation is also prudent to ensure the quality of the measurements. "

Managing annular-pressure buildup (APB) for sustaining well deliverability is particularly crucial in subsea wells, where intervention is complicated. Ordinarily, a multistring casing design accommodates anomalous pressure rise from the standpoint of well integrity. However, management of day-to-day operations presents challenges when APB occurs. This study presents mechanistic models for understanding and mitigating APB during production. By preserving mass, momentum, and energy in the wellbore, we developed two approaches involving semisteady-state and transient formulations. The intrinsic idea is to mimic the physical process with minimal input parameters to estimate pressure buildup in the annuli. Our model formulation handles the mechanisms of fluid expansion and fluid influx/efflux quite rigorously. This approach appears to be quite sufficient because we account for most of the cases of APB encountered. "

For estimating the static head, we use a single expression for liquid holdup, with flow-pattern-dependent values for flow parameter and rise velocity that gradually changes near the transition boundaries to avoid discontinuity in the estimated gradients. Frictional and kinetic heads are estimated with the simple homogeneous modeling approach. As the geothermal fluids ascend up the well, loss of both momentum and heat occurs. The consequent pressure loss often leads to flashing and increase in steam fraction (quality) despite heat loss. Accurate estimation of heat loss, which leads to significant changes in fluid properties influencing pressure-drop, is, therefore, important in modeling flow in geothermal wells. Heat transfer from the wellbore fluid to the surrounding formation is rigorously modeled by treating the wellbore as a heat sink of finite radius in an infinite-acting medium (formation) and accounting for the resistances to heat transfer by various elements of the wellbore. We present a comparative study involving the new model and those that are often used for geothermal wells. These models include those of Ansari et al.'s, Orkiszewski's, Hagedorn and Brown's, and the homogeneous model. The main ingredient of this study entails the use of a small but reliable dataset.

This paper offers two methods for estimating flow rates, predominantly from temperature data to complement rate measurements. One approach consists of modeling the entire wellbore and requires both wellhead pressure (WHP) and wellhead temperature (WHT), whereas the other uses transient temperature formulation at a single point in the wellbore to compute the total production rate. In the entire-wellbore approach, we use a wellbore model handling steady flow of fluids but unsteady-state heat transfer to estimate production rate, given wellhead pressure and temperature. The model rigorously accounts various thermal properties of the fluid and the formation, including Joule-Thompson (J-T) (Thompson and Joule 1853) heating and/or cooling. In the single-point approach, a single-point-temperature measurement made anywhere in the wellbore, including at the wellhead, is needed to estimate the mass rate at a given timestep. The method entails full transient treatment of the coupled fluid- and heat-flow problem at hand. Examples from both gas and oil wells are shown to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology. Good correspondence between the measured and calculated results demonstrates the robustness of the proposed methods. These methods provide important rate information in various settings. For instance, in mature assets they can fill in the information void between tests or replace suspect rate data. Even well-instrumented wells can benefit because the methods can act as a verification tool, particularly in assets where integrated asset models are used to fine tune rate allocation. In addition, the single-point approach can provide the much needed rate information during pressure-transient tests. "

                    "abstract": "The emergence of Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) has led to much better instrumented wells, enabling operators access to real-time temperature data. Sophisticated nodal thermal/fluid models that analyze such temperature data provide many benefits and offer valuable information. Flow profiling is one of the most important field applications of DTS. Since temperature changes caused by fluid flow are typically small, the temperature resolution or noise level of the DTS traces becomes the limiting factor for accuracy in flow profiling.  Noise can be caused by many factors, such as the time length to generate the trace and losses from optical connectors or splices.  The two techniques most commonly used to reduce temperature trace noise are (1) averaging of separately measured traces; and (2) formation of a moving average along the trace (smoothing).  The latter technique - smoothing - comes at the expense of a reduction in spatial resolution.  Another limitation for DTS used alone for flow profiling is that it can only handle single-phase flow situations. Additional information, such as multi-point pressure data, is often needed for multiphase fluid flow profiling. In this paper, we describe our work with Fourier series to approximate DTS traces which offers greater flow profiling accuracy and avoids spatial resolution reduction.  Our mechanistic model couples energy and momentum transport, enabling us to handle multiphase flow by integrating multipoint pressure measurements with DTS. This paper contains three field examples that demonstrate the following techniques resulting in improved flow profiling: Introduction Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) is becoming an increasingly accepted technology in downhole oil and gas applications.  That acceptance has grown as a result of the increasing value that can be realized from such repeated, high-resolution well temperature profiles.  These thermal profiles can be invaluable in such applications as: While a detailed discussion of the design of a DTS system is outside the scope of this paper, two primary physical components are required: The optical fiber itself serves as a passive, linear ‘sensor' capable of providing a resolvable temperature measurement at virtually every point along its entire length. The simplicity of this passive ‘sensor' permanently positioned along the entire completion length is the primary contributor to the reliability of DTS as a dependable measurement. "

Most studies on kerogen have been performed on kerogen samples isolated by dissolving the rock matrix. However, recent studies have shown significant microstructural alteration of kerogen samples after demineralization leading to alteration of their mechanical properties. In this work, in order to study the role of organic matter on mechanical properties of the rock, both organic-rich and organicfree carbonate-rich shale rocks are investigated. A recently developed nano-chemomechanical characterization method is used to directly correlate mechanical properties of both organic-rich and organic-free samples with their chemical composition and mineralogy at micrometer length scales using coupled nanoindentation and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX) technique. The experimental results are used in multiscale structure thought models in which the role of organic matter is modeled as a matrix surrounding inclusions in the composite. Application of these models to the interpretation of nanoindentation results allows us to obtain consistent mechanical properties for the main constituents of these samples, i.e. organic matter and calcite, which are in excellent agreement with the results in the literature. Moreover, adequate agreement is observed between model predictions and experimental measurements of elastic properties of carbonate-rich shale rocks at macroscale. "

Two current flow regimes of peak force - tunneling atomic force microscopy (PF-TUNA) have been used: (1) the vertical out-of-plane current regime with hundred micrometer diameter top electrodes obtains homogenized conductivity quantitatively, (2) the horizontal in-plane current regime was shown powerful to visualize the conductive paths (related to connectivity and tortuosity) for heterogeneous and anisotropic shales. Results show that the approach works well with one to two layers of adsorbed water (25–55% relative humidity) under low frequency (0.5–20 Hz) for shale rocks. Current maps with sub-nanometer resolution emphasize the dominant role of hydrated ions associated with the hydrophilic clay minerals in driving the dielectric response of shales, while conductivity of pyrite and kerogen cannot be neglected for mature organic-rich shale conductive network. The acquired I-V curves at microscale provide a reliable mean to evaluate homogenized conductivity of such multiscale multi-component heterogeneous material under controlled environmental conditions. The procedure discussed herein serves as a complement for fine grained rocks and minerals of ionic-electronic hybrid conductive mechanism under partially water saturation. These results can be used to develop accurate electrical models, specifically for shale rocks with heterogeneous and sophisticated microstructure. The methodology can be also extended to other micro- or meso-porous geomaterials such as cementitious and bituminous nanoporous media. "

These micro-models serve as both a research and pedagogical tool, facilitating the direct visualization of drainage and imbibition within quasi-2D porous media, generated from a range of image modalities (e.g. thin section micrographs, μCT orthoslices, and conventional digital photography). Written in the MATLAB™ language and readily extendible, this open source toolkit is intended to act as enabler for community research for the study of transport in a porous media. In this work, we demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities using X-ray micro-tomographic image data. Orthoslices of scanned rocks (Berea sandstone) are cropped and segmented (binarized), then used to generate watertight 3D meshes of micro-models, which are exported as stereolithography (.stl) files: a native format to most commercially available 3D printers. The generated models are self-contained, with the inlet-outlet ports, synthetic rock matrix and transparent viewing panels printed as a single integrated unit. The open source toolkit presented here offers a more accessible and adaptive approach to micromodel fabrication, when compared to conventional etched/molded equivalents, which require highly specialized manufacturing facilities. We suggest that the availability of such a toolset will act as a major enabler for community research in porous media transport phenomena, allowing experimental quasi-2D pore networks to be generated rapidly and cost effectively using readily available additive manufacturing technologies.

However, eigen analysis of 3D structural lineaments mapped at decimetre to regional scales indicates that discontinuity best fit plane estimates from such datasets tend to be unreliable. Here, the relationship between digitised lineament vertex geometry (coplanarity/collinearity) and the reliability of their estimated best fitting plane is investigated using Monte Carlo experiments. Lineaments are modelled as the intersection curve between two orthonormally oriented fractional Brownian surfaces representing the outcrop and discontinuity plane. Commensurate to increasing lineament vertex collinearity (K), systematic decay in estimated pole vector precision is observed from these experiments. Pole vector distributions are circumferentially constrained around the axis of rotation set by the end nodes of the synthetic lineaments, reducing the rotational degrees of freedom of the vertex set from three to one. Vectors on the unit circle formed perpendicular to this arbitrary axis of rotation conform to von Mises (circular normal) distributions tending towards uniform at extreme values of K. This latter observation suggests that whilst intrinsically unreliable, confidence limits can be placed upon orientation estimates from 3D structural lineaments digitised from remotely sensed data. A probabilistic framework is introduced which draws upon the statistical constraints obtained from our experiments to provide robust best fit plane estimates from digitised 3D structural lineaments.

                    "abstract": "Refracturing has been an appealing technique to mitigate flow rate decline. To optimize refracturing performance, it is crucial to understand stress redistribution due to poroelastic effect, which determines candidate selection, timing, and effectiveness of refracturing. In highly fractured reservoirs, stress redistribution can be complicated and yet only considered by a few literatures. The objective of this work is to predict stress redistribution due to depletion and optimize timing and locations for refracturing in reservoirs with complex hydraulic and natural fractures. In this study, pressure and stress distribution due to depletion in a highly fractured reservoir are predicted using our coupled fluid flow and geomechanics model with Embedded Discrete Fracture Model (EDFM). The model was developed based on a well-known fixed-stress split, which is unconditionally stable. EDFM was coupled to the model to gain capability of simulating complex fracture geometries and high-density fracture system using structured grids. In addition, effects of natural fractures density, hydraulic fracture spacing, differential in-situ stress, and reservoir permeability have been studied. Synthetic cases with multiple natural fractures were created to study effects of natural fractures on stress evolution. The results show that there is a significant difference in stress redistribution due to production when comparing a highly fractured reservoir with a reservoir without natural fractures. This suggests refracturing locations whether it should be between or exactly at parent fractures such that the child fractures can propagate towards un-depleted areas of the reservoir. The critical time to perform refracturing is also recommended at different scenarios as orientation and magnitude of principal stresses change as reservoir pressure declines over the time. Beyond the critical timing, the child fractures may not be able to propagate towards intact areas at all and may damage parent fractures as a result of the reversal of maximum horizontal stress. This difference indicates that effect of natural fractures cannot be neglected in highly fractured reservoirs when performing refracturing. A change in density of natural fractures directly affects size and shape of depleted areas resulting in alteration of stress redistribution both inside and outside SRV region. Other parameters, i.e. hydraulic fracture spacing, differential in-situ stress, and reservoir permeability should also be taken into consideration when studying refracturing as they affect magnitude and redistribution of principal stresses and yield different optimum locations and critical timing in highly fractured reservoirs. To the best of our knowledge, this paper, at the first time, predicts stress evolution induced by depletion in highly fractured reservoirs and considers the effects of heterogeneous natural fracture distribution and density on stress redistribution. The results suggest optimum refracturing locations as well as critical timings to perform refracturing, which provides critical insights for refracturing in highly fractured reservoirs. "

                    "abstract": "For over 50 years, oil and gas companies in North America have been developing technology to produce from unconventional gas resources. During this time, developments in exploration, drilling, completions, and stimulation have led to what is now called the shale revolution. There are publications in the literature describing the volume of the resources (gas in place) in many of the plays in many of the basins. However, the industry is most interested in how much natural gas can be recovered using state of the art technology, which is called technically recoverable resources. Some publications address technically recoverable resources (TRR) of unconventional gas in small geographic areas in North America. However, there is virtually no information published about the magnitude of TRR for unconventional gas on a global scale. Uncertainty exists in geologic and engineering data and, consequently, in the results of calculations made with these data. The uncertainty of the problem begs for a probabilistic solution. The objective of our work was to determine the distribution of unconventional gas TRR worldwide. To achieve this goal, a computer program, called unconventional gas resource assessment system (UGRAS), was developed. The program integrates a Monte Carlo technique with an analytical reservoir simulator. The combination provides an excellent means to predict production profiles for a wide variety of reservoir characteristics and producing conditions. Using UGRAS, the probabilistic distribution of original gas-in-place, TRR, and recovery factor for selected unconventional gas reservoirs in the United States were established and the representative distribution of recovery factors for those unconventional gas reservoirs were derived. Finally, the distribution of recovery factors gained from the analyses of unconventional gas reservoirs in the United States was extended to estimate global unconventional gas TRR. UGRAS is a robust tool that may be used to evaluate and rank shale gas, tight gas, and coal bed methane (CBM) resources worldwide. Results of this work verify the existence of significant technically recoverable unconventional gas resources worldwide and can guide industry better target its exploitation efforts worldwide. Global CBM TRR was estimated from 500 (P90) to 3000 (P10) trillion cube feet (Tcf). Global tight gas TRR ranges from 37,000 (P90) to 80,000 (P10) Tcf and global shale gas TRR ranges from 4000 (P90) to 24,000 (P10) Tcf. "

                    "abstract": "Optimization has taken several different hues in all areas of engineering. Hydraulic fracturing, as applied to oil and gas wells, has had its share. In the past, and before the maturing of high-permeability fracturing and the tip screen out techniques, this well stimulation procedure was limited to low-permeability reservoirs and unrestricted fracturing. In such cases, the fracture length would be an appropriate design optimization variable against an economic criterion, e.g., the Net Present Value (NPV). This involved the balancing of incremental future revenue against the cost of execution. Also interesting would be parametric studies, allowing the variation of execution variables and the detection of differences in their respective design NPV. Such differences would be useful in decisions to measure a variable or stay within reasonable assumptions. The emergence of higher-permeability fracturing and the Unified Fracture Design (UFD) concept allowed two important notions. First, there is no difference between low and high-permeability reservoirs in terms of benefiting from fracturing. Just execution issues need to be resolved. Second, and more important, for any mass of proppant to be injected in any well, there exists only one fracture geometry that would maximize production. This geometry, consisting of length and propped width (with height as a parasitic variable) can be readily determined and, if placed, it will provide the maximum productivity index. All other combinations of length and width would result in lower productivity values. This is physical optimization. In this paper we combine the two: the economic and physical optimizations. For each proppant mass we first optimize the fracture physical performance, and then we apply the NPV criterion. We perform a series of parametric studies for a range of gas reservoirs and we use economic variables that differ in various parts of the world. We show how to determine the optimum fracture size. We then show how fracture treatments may be attractive in certain reservoirs in mature areas but not attractive elsewhere. We also show that for a diversified company, given the choice, few successful fractures in high-permeability reservoirs are far preferable to fracturing large numbers of wells in lower permeability fields, although the latter can be made economically attractive only through hydraulic fracturing.

These data have always been enlightening, but the current trends are more than enlightening, they are cause for concern. Fueled by the strong demand for petroleum engineering graduates at all degree levels for the past several years, petroleum engineering enrollment in the US, particularly at the undergraduate level, is increasing in a manner similar to the period between 1976 and 1982. The enrollment data in Fig. 1 is alarming, and each university needs to understand the industry situation to determine its proper course of action. In our opinion, engineering departments cannot continue increasing enrollment at the current rate or they most likely will experience a sudden decline, as they did in the mid-1980s. At some point in the near future, enrollment needs to level off and grow at a much lower rate, if at all. Those of us who have been in the business since the 1970s remember the enrollment “mountain” shown in Fig. 1 that peaked in 1984. For those of us in academia, the most significant part of this mountain was the incredibly fast rate at which enrollment declined, causing considerable stress in all departments and the closures of some departments. For petroleum engineering students graduating in those years, the implications were dire, for there were no jobs in the industry for a large number of them. A closer examination of the past few years helps to understand where the growth is occurring. Fig. 2 shows bachelor of science degree enrollments in petroleum engineering departments in the US. Of particular interest is the change that has occurred in just the past year. "

We have studied 25 basins in North America and conclude that over 90% of the technically recoverable resources (TRR) in natural gas formations can be found in unconventional reservoirs. We believe these statistics can be extrapolated to every basin in the world that produces substantial volumes of oil and gas. In fact, we have estimated that the world has over 57,000 Tcf of TRR in these basins. Not all of the TRR is economically recoverable because of gas prices, costs and other issues, such as lack of infrastructure, but the gas is there and can be produced in the future. However, the oil and gas industry must follow basic guidelines to ensure safety and environmental awareness as it develops these resources over the coming decades. "

However, one of the most uncertain aspects of shale gas development is our ability to accurately forecast gas resources and shale gas development economics. The uncertainty of the problem begs for a probabilistic solution. The objective of our work was to develop the data sets, methodology and tools to determine values of original gas in place (OGIP), technically recoverable resources (TRR), recovery factor (RF) and economic viability in highly uncertain and risky shale gas reservoirs. Existing approaches for determining values of TRR, such as the use of decline curves or even volumetric analyses, may not be reliable during early time because there may not be enough production history for decline curves to work well or the uncertainty in the reservoir properties may be too large for volumetric analyses to be useful. To achieve our research objective, we developed a computer program, Unconventional Gas Resource Assessment System (UGRAS). In the program, we integrated Monte Carlo technique with an analytical reservoir simulator to estimate the original volume in place, predict production performance and estimate the fraction of TRR that are economically recoverable resources (ERR) for a variety of economic situations. We applied UGRAS to dry gas wells in the Barnett Shale and the Eagle Ford shale to determine the probabilistic distribution of their resource potential and economic viability. Based on our assumptions, the Eagle Ford shale in the dry gas portion of the play has more technically recoverable resources than the Barnett shale. However, the Eagle Ford shale is currently not as profitable as the Barnett shale because of the higher drilling costs in the Eagle Ford dry gas window. We anticipate that the tools and methodologies developed in this work will be applicable to any shale gas reservoir that has sufficient data available. These tools should ultimately be able to allow determination of technically and economically recoverable resources from shale gas reservoirs globally. "

                    "abstract": "One major source of new natural gas supplies for the world will be gas from low-permeability reservoirs. Currently, natural gas from tight sandstones, carbonates, coal seams and shales accounts for over 25% of the annual gas production in the United States. Global production of gas from similar reservoirs world wide will be expected in the next few decades. For such reservoirs, the wells have to be successfully fracture treated to produce at commercial gas flow rates. In many situations, the designed created length was probably achieved, and maybe even the designed propped length was achieved. However, due to insufficient proppant concentration, or insufficient proppant transport, or the use of the wrong propping agent, or a fracture fluid that does not break to a low viscosity fluid, the effective fracture length is significantly less than the designed length and does not provide optimal production results. It is our opinion that insufficient fracture fluid cleanup is the primary cause of poor results when the optimal effective fracture length is not achieved. Fracture fluid cleanup is affected by gel damage, which includes the static yield stress, the flowing yield stress, the amount of polymer residue in the fracture after the fracture closes, and the amount of polymer that forms a filter cake on the walls of the fracture. In addition, there are other issues such as proppant crushing and non-Darcy flow effects that also affect fracture fluid cleanup. In this research, we have used a reservoir simulator to model how polymers in the fracture affect fracture fluid cleanup. We have incorporated mathematical expressions for static yield stress. We have included the effects of proppant crushing, gel residue plugging and the formation of a filter cake on the cleanup behavior and the resulting gas flow rates. With our model, we are able to simulate many of the problems we observe in field data and problems documented in the petroleum literature.

                    "abstract": "Most estimates of the resource endowment [original gas in place (OGIP)] reported for world unconventional gas start with Rogner's top-down study (Rogner 1997). That global estimate is most likely quite conservative because the oil and gas industry has discovered enormous volumes of shale gas around the world since the 1990s. The data from these new reservoirs add substantially to our understanding of the unconventional resource base. Furthermore, the uncertainty of Rogner's assessment was not quantified. Thus, considering the uncertainty, a new assessment of original unconventional gas in place worldwide is needed. The objective of this project was to estimate the probabilistic distributions of original volumes of gas trapped in coalbed, tightsand, and shale reservoirs worldwide. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed published assessments of coal and conventional and unconventional resources and established the quantitative relationship between unconventional gas [coalbed methane (CBM), tight-sands gas, and shale gas] and the conventional hydrocarbon (coal, conventional gas, and oil) resource endowments for North America. Then, we used this relationship to extrapolate original unconventional gas in place worldwide. Our assessment of the world resource endowment established an unconventional OGIP of 83,400 Tcf (P10) to 184,200 Tcf (P90), which is 2.6 to 5.7 times greater than Rogner's estimate of 32,600 Tcf. Our regional assessments of unconventional OGIP should help industry better target its efforts to rapidly accelerate the development of unconventional gas resources worldwide. The methodology used to assess the distribution of each type of unconventional OGIP may be used to estimate unconventional gas resources at the country or basin level, given knowledge of the coal in place and technically recoverable resources of conventional hydrocarbons.

                    "abstract": "Summary With the increased demand for energy and the declining conventional hydrocarbons worldwide, energy companies are turning to unconventional resources such as shale gas. With more than 2, 000 Tcf of gas in place identified in just 5 shale gas plays in the United States, shale-gas formations are now the number one targets for exploration drilling. Furthermore, there are still many more major shale-gas plays and basins waiting to be explored, evaluated, and developed. Because of the extremely low permeability of most shale formations, it is essential to select the appropriate completion techniques for shale-gas reservoirs. There are very few papers in the petroleum literature that provide a logical method to select completion techniques for given shale-gas-reservoir conditions. There are papers discussing successful completion techniques that seem to work for a specific shale. We have used many of these SPE papers to help define \"best practices\" in completing shale-gas reservoirs. We then developed logic to determine the best practice in completing shale-gas reservoirs as a function of reservoir conditions. In this paper, we will specifically cover the logic we have developed for choosing completion techniques in shale-gas reservoirs. First, we performed a literature review on the five basins as well as on all shale-gas plays in the US to determine the best practices in shale-gas completion techniques in fluctuating price environments and identify key geologic parameters that affect overall well performance. From our literature review, we identified seven pertinent geologic parameters that influence shale-gas completion practices. Next, we identified different completion trends in the industry for different geologic settings. Subsequently, we generated an economic model and performed sensitivity analysis to determine optimal completions for each gas-shale basin. On the basis of these economic models, we developed decision flow charts to select completion techniques. Finally, we programmed the flow chart, and we call this program Shale Gas Advisor. This program can be used to determine optimum completion best practices not only for the five gas-shale basins discussed, but also for gas-shale plays that have similar geologic attributes. We validated the program with published case histories in the SPE literature. "

                    "abstract": "Research Objective Development of improved air emissions management through better emissions estimation methodologies and best available estimation techniques for hydraulic fracturing phases. Problem Statement - Policy without data Federal and State regulators are developing air emissions regulations that will have an impact on the oil and gas industry. In the near future, regulatory requirements will be put in place that entail the measurement and reporting of such air emissions as NOx, VOCs, Greenhouse gases (such as methane), NO2, SO2 and more. Historically, air emissions studies have been conducted using methods that sample off site, ambient air. Much of the data gathered in this fashion falls short because this collection method fails to consider emissions transport from other industry such as power generation, waste water treatment, or even emissions that blow in from other countries. It also falls short of being helpful to the industry since the operators and service providers are left questioning which pieces of equipment are producing these emissions if any. Solution If properly characterized, these sources may be eliminated from regulatory compliance requirements by simply identifying and demonstrating their minimal contributions as de minimis sources. The research team traveled to a hydraulic fracturing site on the Eagle Ford Shale Play and collected real time activity data from equipment that has the potential to release large amounts of air pollutants. Actual run times and load factors of the engines were measured. The activity data was then compared to data collected in the traditional manner of conservative off-site emission assumptions. Regulators performing offsite estimates will typically default to the conservative assumption that engines are operating at 100% load and 24 hours a day, and every day that the operation occurs. Problem Statement - Calculations Based on Outdated Standards The emissions factors that the regulators typically use are the US EPA AP-42 Standards that were created in 1974 and updated in 1996.2 Unless provided data to the contrary, it is likely that regulators will continue to use AP-42 for emissions calculations as the basis for potential regulatory development. These emission factors assume the worst possible emissions output. Meaning that emissions are calculated with the assumption that engines are uncontrolled - or no emissions reduction controls on them whatsoever. Solution This study will show that the hydraulic fracture pump engines are in fact the newer tiered engines - many of which have significant emissions controls on them.3 The graph below (Figure 1) demonstrates the difference between an emissions estimate from AP-42 standards with 100% engine load estimation and an emissions estimate using tiered engine data at an actual engine load factor that takes a weighted average of 39.2% load for 7.5 hours and 15% load (idle) for 4.5 hours. The results indicate that the Tier II fracture pump engines are emitting 539 pounds per hour less emissions than the AP-42 estimation would assume. Additionally, using tiered engine emissions factors are acceptable to Federal and State regulators. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract During the past decade, the worldwide demand for energy has continued to increase at a rapid rate. Natural gas has emerged as a primary source of US energy. The technically recoverable natural gas resources in the United States have increased from approximately 1,400 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) to approximately 2,100 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 2010. The recent declines in gas prices have created short-term uncertainties and increased the risk of developing natural gas fields, rendering a substantial portion of this resource uneconomical at current gas prices.  This paper quantifies the impact of changes in finding and development costs (F&DC), lease operating expenses (LOE), and gas prices, in the estimation of the economically recoverable gas for unconventional plays. To develop our methodology, we have performed an extensive economic analysis using data from the Barnett Shale, as a representative case study. We have used the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of the Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) for all wells in a given gas play, to determine the values of the P10 (10th percentile), P50 (50th percentile), and P90 (90th percentile) from the CDF. We then used these probability values to calculate the technically recoverable resource (TRR) for the play, and determine the economically recoverable resource (ERR) as a function of F&DC, LOE, and gas price. Our selected investment hurdle for a development project is a 20% rate of return and a payout of 5 years or less. Using our methodology, we have developed software to solve the problem. For the Barnett Shale data, at a F&DC of $3 Million, we have found that 90% of the Barnet shale gas is economically recoverable at a gas price of $46/Mcf, 50% of the Barnet shale gas is economically recoverable at a gas price of $9.2/Mcf, and 10% of the Barnet shale gas is economically recoverable at a gas price of $5.2/Mcf. The developed methodology and software can be used to analyze other unconventional gas plays to reduce short-term uncertainties and determine the values of F&DC and gas prices that are required to recover economically a certain percentage of TRR.  Introduction With declining conventional gas reserves in the United States, unconventional gas reservoirs are emerging as critical energy sources to meet the ever increasing demand for energy. The US Department of Energy's April 2009 report, \"Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer,?? stated that over the last decade, production from unconventional resources in the US has increased almost 65%, from 5.4 trillion cubic feet per year (Tcf/yr) in 1998 to 8.9 Tcf/yr in 2007. This increase in production indicates that approximately 46% of today's US total gas production comes from unconventional resources (Navigant 2008).  The increasing reliance on unconventional resources has captured the interest of the oil and gas industry in assessing the amount of unconventional gas that is technically recoverable in the US and worldwide. Today, the US Geological Survey, among other agencies, periodically assesses and provides ample information in terms of how much gas is technically recoverable in US basins. However, due to the nature of unconventional resources and the complexity of the analysis required to develop them, less emphasis has been placed on quantifying the impact of the range of factors that influence the calculation of how much gas is economically recoverable. Currently, with the publically available production data, gas prices, and costs for US basins, there is an opportunity to develop a methodology to estimate how much gas can be economically recovered from the reported assessments given a range of prices and costs.

                    "abstract": "As gas production from conventional gas reservoirs in the United States decreases, the industry is turning more attention to the exploration and development of unconventional gas resources (UGRs). This trend is expanding quickly worldwide. However, unlike in many mature North American basins where significant development of UGRs is now routine, many countries are just turning to UGRs exploration. Insightful resource assessment is important for tapping UGRs in these frontier basins. To evaluate the UGRs in frontier basins that are underexplored, we developed basin analysis methodology to 1) characterize basins; 2) establish analogs between frontier basins and mature North American basins; 3) estimate conventional and unconventional resources in mature North American basins; and 4) quantitatively predict UGRs in frontier basins by using information from analogous North American basins. This comprehensive basin analysis study not only validates the resource triangle, which is characterized by a large ratio of unconventional TRR (technically recoverable resources) to conventional TRR, but also makes it possible to quantitatively assess unconventional resources in under-explored basins worldwide. To demonstrate use of basin analysis in evaluating the UGRs of frontier basins, two world hotspots for UGRs exploration were selected as the target basins: Neuquén basin in South America and Berkine basin in North Africa. Recent assessment reports and exploration activities indicate that the two basins have substantial unconventional gas resources. As a case study, basin analysis was used to identify the North American reference basins that are analogous to the Neuquén and Berkine basins, and to characterize the distributions of UGRs in these frontier basins. Furthermore, the quantitatively estimated unconventional TRR were compared with those from EIA (Energy Information Administration) and companies to support the effectiveness of basin analysis results.  Introduction Unconventional resources encompass a broad range of oil and gas deposits that have been bypassed for decades because they were not considered economically feasible to produce. While discussions of peak oil and the limitations placed on production by many foreign countries continue, US companies have quickly moved toward unconventional resources as a viable source of oil and gas production. Advances in exploration, drilling and completion technologies in the past 20 years have led to the opening of new areas in the domestic U.S. targeting unconventional resources. In 2009, tight gas production amounted to roughly 31.5 percent of the total U.S. natural gas production; shale gas and coalbed methane accounted for 15.5 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively (EIA, 2011a). Recently, this surge in developing recoverable unconventional natural gas has also greatly impacted many countries and regions outside the US. For example, a recent study by EIA (2011b) reports initial assessments of technically recoverable shale gas resources in 32 foreign countries. However, these foreign countries are just now beginning to understand and plan the assessments of unconventional gas resources in the frontier basins with very limited information. To evaluate UGRs in frontier (or target) basins where the resources have been underexplored, assessments have been conducted on basin characterization, basin analogy, quantification of UGRs in NA (North America) reference basins, and estimates of UGRs volumes in the frontier (or target) basins (Singh et al. 2008; Cheng et al. 2011a, 2011c). These results were integrated to arrive at a frontier basin analysis estimate of UGRs. Generally, the approach identifies the NA reference basins that are analogous to a frontier basin, and then uses the resource distributions in the analogous basin to estimate the distribution and volume of UGRs in the frontier basin (Table 1).

                    "abstract": "Abstract With the trend of economic, regulatory and technological changes, demand of a comprehensive standard to systematically evaluate and manage the risks of wellbore collisions has become significant in offshore oil development. Several accidents happened during normal operations at the Bohai Sea oilfield, including boreholes collision and drilling through adjacent casings. Under this situation, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) adopted new offshore well anti-collision standard and related remedial measures.  As part of the anti-collision safety operation system in CNOOC offshore oil drilling, the standard is designed and established for requirements mainly in four perspectives, including: data and material collection specifications in the early stage of drilling; anti-collision risk analysis in drilling design; anti-collision safety technical measures in drilling operation and operation site; remedial strategies and operations in case of wellbore collision. In this paper, we also describe how the standard has been applied to the several recent cases, and discuss its benefits for the anti-collision risk control of drilling offshore cluster wells and adjustment wells, treatment cost reduction, and marine environment safety.  Introduction With the worldwide growth in offshore drilling activities, operators are encountering more complicated and more crowded drilling, and greater emphasis is placed on avoiding collisions with offset wellbores. In China, there has been great development in offshore oil with a few significant trends:  - Increased complexity of drilling technologies: mature technologies include shallow orientation technology, wellbore controlling technology, and highly-deviated well sliding technology.  -Expanded project scope and costs in offshore applications: for example, there is great demand of large-scale development of Bohai offshore region in a short term, and, usually, the offshore platforms with ambitious drilling projects tend to increase the number of available slots without the expense of major additions to infrastructure. Coupled with an already crowded environment of existing wells, the need to add new ones to extend platform life creates very challenging collision- avoidance scenarios.  -Greater well density and well pattern: with the support of mature technologies and the need of expanding offshore oil development, the well pattern increases from 2×2 or 4×4 to 5×7 or 4×10, and the well spacing changes from 2m×2m to 1.8m×1.8m, or even smaller 1.5m×1.6m.  On one hand, these trends greatly reduce comprehensive cost of cluster well, improve the platform utilizing rate, and increase the oil field development speed; On the other hand, however, implications of well collisions are becoming significant: many wells are drilled in close proximity to each other, making the cross-borehole and collision problems quite possible under the conditions of crowded directional wells. Therefore, it is critical to establish comprehensive, reliable and effective anti-collision risk management standard and remedial measures for China offshore drilling.  For the crowded cluster wells, there are mainly three types of anti-collision problems: - Anti-collision between wells in the platform, including the inclination of straight well intervals, the depth at the kick off point, and the initial orientation. - Anti-collision between wells in the platform and prospecting wells in the field covered by the platform. - Anti-collision between wells in the platform and wells in the nearby platforms.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Information is key to evaluating the unconventional resources both with regard to characterizing the properties of geologic and petroleum systems, but also to estimating the potential of different resource types. The complex requirements for the data include: 1) integration of data with multiple types (e.g., basin general data, petroleum system data, and resource volume data), 2) display of the different patterns or correlations among the data (e.g., value distributions, geologic relationship, and geographical profile), 3) interpretation of data evaluation (e.g., numeric functions, evaluation models, and result meanings). Therefore, it is important to maintain a well-organized representation and management of data for better evaluation and decision-making.  In this contribution, the paper presents results of a resource evaluation system where the visualization method is thoroughly utilized not only to display and analyze data over multiple patterns and functions, but to enable users to clearly and easily manage data that have different types and relationships. The study was performed on a database that contains large volume of data about 25 North American basins having significant unconventional resource development. Here detailed, integrated data analysis was required for analog analysis and resource estimation to evaluate frontier basins. The solution was realized based on an integration of data visualization, management, and analysis using newly developed technologies.  It is shown that the integrated visualization and management of evaluation data helps discover the insightful relationships and patterns in different perspectives or scales, which is unattainable by traditional histograms or plots. Visualized data analysis and views highlight important results and critical factors of identifying analog basins while allowing the users to generally understand the large volume of data. In addition, the designed model enables users to manage data more efficiently, and supports the better understanding and transfer of knowledge.  Introduction The UGA (Unconventional Gas Advisory) system is a software package with multi-components to provide recommendations that describe a set of reasonable, interconnected solutions for a broad array of issues in the development of unconventional gas resources. For the BASIN, PRISE, and FAST components in the UGA system (Fig. 1), on one hand, each of them has individual models to address a particular field of issues: BASIN is based on a data-driven, deterministic model to identify the analogous North American basins for a frontier basin (Cheng, 2011); PRISE develops a systematic way of integrating and evaluating the data from different agencies to assess the resource distributions of conventional and unconventional resources in North American basins (Matin, 2010; Cheng, 2010); FAST is an extension of BASIN to objectively and quickly identify analog formations (Cheng, 2010). On the other hand, the BASIN, PRISE, and FAST components draw on the same database and are combined together for the a higher level of resource evaluations, which, for example, include the quantified prediction of technically recoverable resources in frontier basins (Cheng, 2011).  For the database that contains a large volume of evaluation data for the connected components, the integrated design is required for the management of various types of data in the database. To facilitate the management, visualization tool is used to reflect the model-related meanings and relationships of the data. In addition, for the advisory system that aims at guiding the exploration in frontier basins where experiences and practices are very limited, knowledge transfer is important. Thus, the visualization tool is also used for interpretation of the evaluation methods and demonstration of the relationships among the models. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract During the past decades, investigation of unconventional gas resources has become a significant area due to its promising outlook of meeting the future energy needs. When the unconventional gas resources, especially those in frontier basins, expose a set of challenging issues that both knowledge and practice are very limited, basin analog analysis has been employed for preliminary assessments of frontier plays.  For basin analog, it compares a comprehensive spectrum of features between the target basin and reference basin, and this process involves large-volume data with broad value ranges. To rapidly and effectively evaluating the unconventional hydrocarbon resource potential in frontier basins (i.e., the target basins), basin analog approach has been proposed since 2008, in combination with a database populated with well-characterized geologic and petroleum systems information of North America basins that have significant unconventional resource development (i.e., the reference basins). The continuing investigation has been based on the public literature, and it is noted that data of many petroleum systems are incomplete that cannot cover the entire comprehensive parameters. This problem is inherently typical of the unconventional basins: many unconventional petroleum systems are newly developed and the characterization data are unavailable; or the unconventional basins, especially for the frontier basins, are exploratory with many plays undeveloped or in the very early development stage. Another major problem in analyzing basin analog is that parameters are usually multi-valued due to the wide range of petroleum systems.  In this paper, we analyzed the previous approaches of basin analog analysis and proposed an improved solution to the problems. The improved method is based on extracting the characterized parameter distributions in basin scale, and compares distributions by using probability theory and information theory. This method can not only solve the incomplete analog and multi-value comparison problems to achieve more accurate results, but also directly reflect the quantified distributions of different parameters in multiple basins simultaneously. Also discussed are validation of the analogous relationships by basin resource distributions and the further usage of the improved basin analog analysis for estimating unconventional resource volumes in frontier basins.  Introduction Why analog? When there is only limited knowledge on the new object of interest, it is an intuitive thinking to try to connect the object with the well-known objects. This analog method is commonly used in the field of geosciences, where geologists have traditionally employed analogy to support their interpretations. Such usage includes the frequently-quoted principle \"the present is the key to the past?? or the statement \"that the best geologist is the one who has seen the most rocks?? (McCormick, 1999). As a supplementary analysis, the geological analog is helpful to characterize the less accessible reservoirs and compliment the field model.  The analog method also applies to the analysis for unconventional gas resources in frontier basins: while resources and reserves are well characterized in many North American basins that have significant UGR (Unconventional Gas Resources) development, most basins outside North America (i.e., frontier basins) are underexplored with little information about the unconventional resources. Therefore, the analog method provides a way to understand the frontier basin by comparing the basin with the mature North American basins. Moreover, the basin analog discussed in the paper goes beyond the geologic characteristics, but incorporates large amounts and diverse types of data concerning both geology and engineering information. These comprehensive parameters are important components to support the quantified estimation of volume and guide the exploration decisions. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Along with the trend that unconventional gas resources are significant in meeting the great energy demand, it is intuitively needed to know their quantified volume, especially for the frontier basins where little exploration of unconventional resources has been undertaken. Following by our work in standardized investigation and quantified evaluation of recoverable resources in 25 mature North American basins, this paper further employs two methods to evaluate TRR (Technically Recoverable Resources) for unconventional gas in frontier basins: Source Rock method (SR) and Conventional TRR Input method (CTRRI).  The source rock method derives from the fact that source rock potential is the mechanism for generating hydrocarbons. Thus, using the relationships between TRR and source rock factors, the SR can adequately capture TRR from the indirect source rock evaluation. Combined with the ratio of unconventional and conventional hydrocarbons from our prior investigations, the method can further deduce conventional resources and unconventional resource volumes. Different from SR that provides an independent measure of TRR, conventional TRR input method requires known recoverable conventional resources for frontier basin. To calculate frontier basin TRR volume, the frontier basin's recoverable conventional volume is divided by the fraction of conventional resources in the similar reference basin from basin analog system investigation (BASIN). It is noted that all the quantifications are regulated by the unified definition from petroleum resource investigation summary and evaluation (PRISE). Although the two methods estimate TRR for frontier basins in different conditions, the initial tests on three basins show that estimates by CTRRI are in accordance with those by SR. The results validate the resource triangle concept with distributions of different resource types (i.e., conventional oil, conventional gas, coalbed methane, shale gas, and tight gas sand), and can be further evaluated by more complete estimation of North American basin resources and international unconventional gas resources.  Introduction Currently it is clear that there is an enormous volume of oil and gas in unconventional reservoirs, and these resources in the tight reservoirs, the coal seams and the shales are expected to be significant in fulfilling the global energy demand, just as they have already played a major role in the U.S. gas supply in recent years (Martin et al. 2010). To evaluate the feasibility of developing these resources, it is important to estimate the volume of TRR (Technically Recoverable Resources).  TRR are resources producible using current recovery technology but without reference to economic profitability (Schmoker, 2005), and can be combined with other key values (e.g., gas in place and economically recoverable resources) to determine how to proceed with investment and development. In particular, the preliminary estimates of technically recoverable unconventional resources are important for making economic and development strategy in frontier basins worldwide, where little unconventional resource exploration has been undertaken and thus the knowledge and experience is very limited.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Development of unconventional hydrocarbons is increasingly important as conventional resources decline and oil and gas demand increases. The concept of the energy resource triangle (Masters 1979) suggests unconventional oil and gas are abundant, but the exploitation of these resources is particularly sensitive to both technology and commodity prices. In this paper, we assess the effects of technology and various geopolitical and economic events on historic U.S. unconventional oil and gas production, in the context of Master's resource triangle theory (RTT).  We used the Austin Chalk as the base case and then extended the study to seven other unconventional plays. The two approaches used to evaluate the RTT were: (1) correlation of commodity prices and technology with drilling activity, and (2) production forecasting using decline curve analysis. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient was used technique to establish the dependence between active wells, rig count, and commodity price variables. Decline curve analyses allowed us to estimate the increase in production from different scenarios of high price or technology.  Results support the RTT concept: higher commodity prices encouraged the introduction of new technologies, and increased drilling activity and boosted production from unconventional plays. For example, horizontal drilling revived older plays, such as the Austin Chalk. Moreover, the combination of horizontals wells and advanced fracture stimulation techniques led to the expansion of shale plays such as the Barnett and the Bakken. Correlation of commodity prices with drilling activity demonstrated that, during periods of high commodity prices, the number of producing wells increased an average of 75%. Using decline curve analysis, a maximum of $50 billion oil and gas production was forecasted via vertical, fractured wells (conventional technologies) and an economic cutoff of 5 BOE/d/well. However, current production plans, using improved technologies, suggest that the assessed plays may produce an additional $320 billion oil plus gas. U.S. production from unconventional reservoirs, stimulated by a federal tax credit, technology advances, and high commodity prices, encourage operators to dip lower into the resource triangle. Lessons learned in the U.S. may encourage the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas worldwide.  Introduction Advances in technology and better economics have supported the exploitation of unconventional reservoirs in the United States. The concept of the energy resource triangle (Masters, 1979) explains that unconventional oil and gas are abundant, but the exploitation of these resources is particularly sensitive to both technology and commodity prices (Fig. 1). In this paper, we assess the effects of technology and various geopolitical and economic events on U.S. unconventional production, in the context of Master's resource triangle theory (RTT). "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Most estimates of the resource endowment (original gas in place) reported for world unconventional gas start with Rogner's 1997 \"top-down?? study. That global estimate is most likely quite conservative, since the oil and gas industry has discovered enormous volumes of shale gas around the world since the 1990's. The data from these new reservoirs add substantially to our understanding of the unconventional resource base. Furthermore, the uncertainty of Rogner's assessment was not quantified. Thus, a new assessment of original unconventional gas in place worldwide with considering the uncertainty is needed.  The objective of this project was to estimate the probabilistic distributions of original volumes of gas trapped in coalbed, tight sand and shale reservoirs, worldwide. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed published assessments of coal, conventional and unconventional resources and established the quantitative relationship between unconventional gas (coalbed methane, tight sands gas, and shale gas) and the conventional hydrocarbon (coal, conventional gas and oil) resource endowments for North America. Then, we used this relationship to extrapolate original unconventional gas in place, worldwide. Our assessment of the world resource endowment established an unconventional OGIP of 83,400 Tcf (P90)-184,200 Tcf (P10), which is 2.6-5.7 times greater than Rogner's estimate of 32,600 Tcf.  Our regional assessments of unconventional OGIP should help industry better target its efforts to rapidly accelerate the development of unconventional gas resources worldwide. The methodology used to assess the distribution of each type of unconventional OGIP may be used to estimate unconventional gas resources at the country or basin level, knowing the coal in place and technically recoverable resources of conventional hydrocarbons.  Introduction As the world reserves of liquid hydrocarbons from conventional reservoirs peaks and begins to decline, natural gas will play an increasingly important energy supply role. However, as the use of natural gas increases, additional supplies will be needed. To obtain additional natural gas supplies, the industry can develop unconventional gas resources that are often overlooked in the search for conventional hydrocarbons. Higher natural gas prices and significant technological advances have led to a dramatic increase in production of unconventional gas resources in the US in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue unabated and to expand worldwide.  Strong oil and gas demand is pushing coalbed methane exploration and production outside of North America. In countries such as Australia and China, coalbed methane will become an important energy source in the future. In many other countries in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America, coalbed methane potential and commercial aspects of coalbed methane production are not understood yet (Chakhmakhchev 2007).  Tight sands gas represents a significant portion of natural gas resources worldwide. Large reserves of tight sands gas have been identified outside of North America, such as in India, China, and several European countries. Currently, there is an emerging focus on tight sands gas reservoirs in the Middle East and North Africa to supply the growing energy needs in this region and to save the oil from conventional resources for export and generation of hard currencies.  A number of major and independent oil and gas companies are circling the globe looking for high-quality shale-gas plays. Currently, shale-gas exploration is underway in many parts of the world, including in the Alum shale of Sweden, the Amadeus shale in Australia, and the carbonaceous shales of Botswana. Since the delineation of shale gas is still in its infancy, global shale-gas resources have not been appraised in any systematic way. "

                    "abstract": "Management Gas reservoirs are often classified as conventional or unconventional. Conventional gas reservoirs are characterized by high permeability with the gas stored in sand or carbonate formations in pore spaces that are interconnected. A gas resource is generally considered conventional if it does not require a large stimulation treatment to be able to produce oil and gas at economic flow rates. An unconventional gas reservoir can be defined as a natural-gas reservoir that cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes unless the well is stimulated by a large hydraulic fracture treatment, a horizontal wellbore, or multilateral wellbores (Holditch, 2006). The three most common types of unconventional gas resources are tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas shales. Unconventional gas reservoirs are characterized by low permeability, in the microdarcy range (Fig. 1) or less. As the permeability deceases, the economic risk of developing the resource increases, and the investment required also increases because more wells have to be drilled to produce the reservoir, as each well recovers less gas per well than one can recover per well from a conventional reservoir. The US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA) defines the total natural-gas resource base as all of the gas that has ever been trapped inside the Earth, including the volumes that have already been produced. The part of the total natural-gas resource base that interests investors most, however, is the remaining natural gas waiting to be extracted. Research indicates the existence of large, unconventional gas reservoirs located throughout the world. Rogner (1997) estimated that there are 9,000 Tcf of original gas in place (OGIP) reserves in coalbed methane, 16,000 Tcf of OGIP in shale gas, and 7,400 Tcf of OGIP in tight gas sands around the world (Table 1). Since Rogner published his paper, the oil and gas industry has discovered enormous volumes of natural gas in unconventional gas reservoirs in North American and in several other basins around the world. It is believed that the OGIP estimates in Table 1 are very conservative. The industry will be updating the values in Table 1 and it is expected that the values of OGIP will increase substantially. With declining conventional gas reserves in the United States, unconventional gas reservoirs are emerging as critical energy sources to meet the increasing demand for energy. The US DOE April 2009 report, Modern Shale Gas Development in the United States: A Primer, stated that over the last decade, production from unconventional resources in the US has increased almost 65%, from 5.4 Tcf/yr in 1998 to 8.9 Tcf/yr in 2007. This increase in production indicates that approximately 46% of today’s US total gas production comes from unconventional resources (Navigant 2008). "

                    "abstract": "On occasion, a hydraulically fractured tight-gas well does not perform up to its potential because of slow or incomplete fracture-fluid cleanup. A number of papers have been written to address individual factors related to fracture-fluid cleanup, but many questions as to which factors mostly affect gas production from such wells remain unanswered. Numerical reservoir simulation is one of the best methods to study the fracture-fluid-cleanup problem. Continuing from our previous publication (Wang et al. 2008) on the effect of gel damage on fracture cleanup, we used reservoir simulation to analyze systematically the factors that affect fracture-fluid cleanup and gas recovery from tight-gas wells. We first developed a comprehensive data set for typical tight gas reservoirs and then ran single-phase-flow cases for each reservoir and fracture scenario to establish the idealized base-case gas recovery. We then systematically evaluated the following factors: multiphase gas and water flow, proppant crushing, polymer filter cake, and, finally, yield stress of concentrated gel in the fracture. The gel in the fracture is concentrated because of fluid leakoff during the fracture treatment. We evaluated these factors additively in the order listed. We found that the most important factor that reduces fracture-fluid cleanup and gas recovery is the gel strength of the fluid that remains in the fracture at the end of the treatment. This paper illustrates the complexity of the fracture-fluid-cleanup problem and points out the need to use reservoir simulation and to include all the pertinent factors to model fracture-fluid cleanup rigorously. The procedures presented can provide a useful, systematic guide to engineers in conducting a numerical simulation study of fracture-fluid cleanup. "

The volume of UG resources is generally unknown in most basins outside North America. However, in many mature North American basins, UG resources have been produced for decades, and resources and reserves are well characterized. The objective of this work was to determine the quantitative relations between known conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon resources in mature North American basins, with the ultimate goal of using these relations to estimate UG resources in frontier basins outside North America. We used assessments by the US Geological Survey (USGS), Potential Gas Committee (PGC), Energy Information Administration (EIA), National Petroleum Council (NPC), and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to evaluate relations among hydrocarbon-resource types in the Appalachian, Black Warrior, Greater Green River, Illinois, San Juan, Uinta-Piceance, and Wind River basins. We chose these seven basins for initial analysis of relations between CG and UG resources because they are mature basins for both conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. To conduct this analysis, we wrote a computer program that we call Petroleum Resources Investigation Summary and Evaluation (PRISE). Input data for PRISE, obtained from published data sources and resource assessments, were values of technically recoverable resources, consisting of the following resource categories: (1) cumulative production, (2) proved reserves, (3) probable and possible reserves and contingent resources (PPC), and (4) prospective resources. We then analyzed these data in each of the seven basins to assess the relationship between conventional- and unconventional-resource volumes. For the seven basins studied, we found that approximately 10 - 20% of the total recoverable hydrocarbon resources are conventional oil (CO) and CG, whereas 80 - 90% of the recoverable hydrocarbons are UG resources. We suggest that the results of this study may be used to estimate recoverable resources from UG reservoirs in frontier basins worldwide, where CO and CG resources are known but UG resources have not been evaluated.

And a related concern is how the industry will transfer the knowledge from its experienced professionals to the new entrants. Responding to the looming “big crew change” that will result from the retirement of so many petroleum professionals in the next few years, universities have increased enrollment in petroleum engineering departments. US petroleum engineering departments are now producing more graduates than at any time in the last 20 years (Table 1, Fig. 1). Similarly, the number of graduates in petroleum engineering has increased worldwide. Petroleum engineering department heads at US universities have shared enrollment data that indicate total enrollment has leveled off. Many universities are capping enrollment as a result of restrictions on space and the number of professors who are teaching. We expect the number of total graduates in 2011 and beyond to hover around 1,000–1,200. No one counted on a global economic recession that has caused many experienced professionals to postpone their retirement, delaying the long-anticipated “brain drain.” With lower revenues, companies have reduced or put a hold on recruiting new graduates. The result is that the number of jobs being offered to new graduates is being reduced just as the pool of graduates has been enlarged. In 2009, more than 90% of petroleum engineering graduates of US schools were offered jobs or went to graduate school. According to feedback from the US department heads, the 50 oil and gas companies that recruited on campus in 2008 and 2009 are estimating that they will hire only approximately 70% of available graduates in 2010, leading to an estimated 300 graduates needing jobs. Company reports and information from WorldWideWorker.com, which provides the job board for SPE student members, also confirm that global hiring plans for new graduates are expected to be substantially lower in 2010.

                    "abstract": "Abstract With the increased demand for energy and the declining conventional hydrocarbons worldwide, energy companies are turning to unconventional resources, such as shale gas. With over 2, 000 TCF gas in place indentified in just 5 shale gas plays in the United States, shale gas formations are now the number one targets for exploration drilling. Furthermore, there are still many more major shale gas plays and basins waiting to be explored, evaluated and developed. Because of the extremely low permeability of most shale formations, it is essential to select the appropriate completion techniques for shale gas reservoirs. There are very few papers in the petroleum literature that provide a logical method to select completion techniques for given shale gas reservoir conditions. There are papers discussing successful completion techniques that seem to work for a specific shale. We have used many of these SPE papers to help define \"best-practices?? in completing shale gas reservoirs. We then developed logic to determine the best practice on completing shale gas reservoirs as a function of reservoir conditions. In this paper, we will specifically cover the logic we have developed for choosing completion techniques on shale gas reservoirs.  First, we performed a literature review on the five basins as well as on all shale gas plays in the U.S. to determine the best practices in shale gas completion techniques in fluctuating price environments and identify key geologic parameters that affect overall well performance. From our literature review, we identified seven pertinent geologic parameters that influence shale gas completion practices. Next, we identified different completion trends in the industry for different geologic settings. Subsequently, we generated an economic model and performed sensitivity analysis to determine optimal completions for each gas shale basin. Based on these economic models, we developed the decision flowcharts to select completion techniques. Finally, we programmed the flowchart and we call this program as Shale Gas Advisor. This program can be used to determine optimum completion best practices for not only the five gas shale basins discussed, but also, for gas shale plays that have similar geologic attributes. We validated the program with published case histories in the SPE literature.  Introduction Although gas shales are now a very important strategic play for many companies, the industry is still having difficulty determining the optimum drilling and completion techniques for wells drilled in the various shale reservoirs. The industry seems to optimize development in each different play by trial and error. Instead, the industry needs to develop predictive models to help determine the optimum drilling, completion and stimulation options as functions of the shale reservoir properties and economic conditions. In short, the industry needs to determine best practices for various shale scenarios.  As in most unconventional reservoirs, gas shale characteristics can vary substantially both vertically and aerially.  However, despite these variations, shale reservoirs in different basins can be evaluated and compared. The best practices should be somewhat transferable. If engineers and geologists look for differences and similarities in reservoir and geologic properties, then it should be possible to use best practices to design the drilling and completion operations. Most reservoir engineers working in gas shale do not have the time to do a thorough study of industry-wide activity to help determine what is working in other areas and what is not. However, if such information is made available, shale gas development could potentially escalate worldwide. "

Many wells are completed and drilled each year in thick, tight gas reservoirs that have many individual layers that can contribute to production if adequately perforated and stimulated. It is important to select a diversion technique that allows access to the most layers with the most gas in place at minimal costs. However, we have found essentially no papers in the petroleum literature that provide a logical method for selecting the best diverting method for a given set of reservoir conditions. There are papers that discuss successful field cases where specific diversion methods seem to work for specific reservoirs. We have used many of these SPE papers to help define \"best-practices?? concerning the selection of diversion technologies in completing tight gas sands with thick, multiple pay zones.

We have included examples of how TGS Advisor can help the user to determine appropriate diversion technologies for given reservoir conditions. Introduction A Tight Gas Sand (TGS) reservoir was defined by the U.S. Government in 1978 as a gas reservoir with an expected value of permeability of 0.1 md or less. At that time, very little gas was being produced from tight gas reservoirs.  The U.S. Government provided tax and gas price incentives in 1978 to increase the development of gas from unconventional reservoirs. Since that time, the industry has substantially increased the number of wells producing from tight gas reservoirs, Currently, gas production from tight gas sands in the U.S. accounts for over 69% of the gas production from all unconventional gas resources and 19% of the total U.S. gas production (McKinney 2003). Because of high risk and the uncertainties associated with TGS reservoirs, profitable development requires experts to be involved in the most critical development stages, such as drilling, completion, stimulation, and production. However, most of the oil and gas operating companies outside North America have little or no experience in the development of unconventional gas reservoirs. An advisory system for the development of TGS reservoirs will not only be valuable for operators outside of North America, but even in North America, many need to be doing a better job of applying best practices when they are developing unconventional gas reservoirs (Wei 2009a).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Producing natural gas from Tight Gas Sand (TGS) reservoirs will be of increasing importance to the global energy industry in the coming decades. One of the basic decisions concerning the development of TGS reservoirs is to determine the size of the production casing and tubing. Because of low permeability, virtually all of the wells completed in TGS reservoirs must be stimulated to achieve the desired production goals. Therefore, the casing and tubing size must be designed to satisfy the stimulation requirements. Because many TGS wells are completed in reservoirs that have many distinct layers that can contribute to production if adequately treated, it is important to select the optimal diversion techniques in completing these multilayered reservoirs. The casing and tubing size must be designed to allow the selected diversion technique to be used successfully. In addition, during the production period, it is important to continuously remove the liquids from the wellbore. Therefore, the casing and tubing size must also be designed to satisfy the production requirement. In summary, the casing and tubing size must be designed to satisfy the completion, stimulation and production requirements. In this paper, we will provide a methodology we have developed to select the appropriate casing and tubing size for the development of TGS reservoirs.  This work has been part of our effort to build software that we call TGS Advisor. TGS Advisor can be used to provide advice/best practices to engineers developing TGS reservoirs.

Currently, the methodology of choosing casing and tubing size for TGS reservoirs has been programmed and incorporated into the TGS Advisor system. Finally, an example of using TGS Advisor to select the appropriate casing and tubing size in TGS reservoir is presented.  Introduction A Tight Gas Sand (TGS) reservoir was defined by the U.S. government as a gas reservoir with an expected value of permeability of 0.1 md or less. Kuuskraa (2006) reported that around 43% of the natural gas used presently in the US comes from unconventional reservoirs. He also reported that tight gas sands in the US account for over 64% of the gas production from all unconventional gas resources and for 30.8% of total US production (Kuuskraa 2007).

Because of the uncertainties associated with TGS reservoirs, profitable development requires experts to be involved in the most critical development stages, such as drilling, completion, stimulation, and production.

In computer science, the self-adapting bionic optimization model is a state-of-the-art intelligent computation technique which can be used to analyze production data. In this paper we applied the self-adapting bionic optimization model to analyze production data. This method combines the heuristic approach, grey correlation analysis, and fuzzy clustering method in computer science to optimize the reservoir production plan.  To develop the method, we firstly perform grey correlation analysis to describe the initial correlation between production data parameters. By applying fuzzy clustering method, the production data are divided into different categories according to the degrees of their correlations. This heuristic information is used to construct the production data analysis model. Finally the best-optimized correlations among the various production data can be discovered. A simple example with related parameters is presented to show the algorithmic strategies. This example proved that our method is a flexible and cost-effective quantitative analysis method for production data analysis.  To evaluate this model, we selected 50 wells in some gas reservoirs from Xinjiang oilfield, China. The 50 wells have been developed for several years. Therefore, we have enough data on the 50 wells to be applied in this model. It is demonstrated that this model is useful in production data analysis.  Introduction The analysis of production data is becoming more and more important for determining reservoir characteristics, development strategy and enhancement technique. Although sophisticated empirical methods, analytical tools and numeric simulations have been proposed, these approaches are often subject to numerous assumptions and data limitations1. If the data are available, complete, consistent and of good quality, the assumptions can be checked and justified, and also it is possible that meaningful results can be obtained. In practice, however, there are many conditions to be considered: firstly, data from different origins and localities can be uncertain, unreliable, and largely variable; secondly, the large amount of data with various complex parameters increases the difficulty to acquire relatively accurate and comprehensive data; thirdly, under some conditions (e.g., early-stage of development, short-life expectancy, cost control10, etc) some data are not available and the high expense precludes the application of complex analytical and simulation methods. These issues and challenges are difficult to be dealt with by using traditional analysis over production data, and can further influence the decision-making results. "

Owing to declining conventional gas production, the U.S. has led the world in development of unconventional gas resources (UGR) and technology over the past 3 decades. To facilitate transfer of unconventional gas technology and development internationally, we developed a software, FAST (Formation Analog Selection Tool), as a tool to objectively and rapidly identify and rank analog formations. FAST software uses an existing database (BASIN) that contains geoscience and engineering parameters for approximately 240 formations in 25 North American basins that are mature for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production. We designed a FAST report module that provides both general and detailed interpretation graphs and tables. FAST reports give an overview of analog results, and they allow insights into the quantitative details of reservoir parameters comparisons. Although the software needs further validation, preliminary testing shows consistent results. Planned and ongoing improvements to FAST include quality checking of formation parameters in the database, assessment of parameter weighting factors, validation of the analog selection performance against the literature and independent studies regarding analog formations, and linkage of FAST with a Drilling & Completion Advisory System to identify the best engineering practices to be applied in early stages of testing analogous target formations.  Introduction The distribution of oil and gas resources may be illustrated using the resource triangle (Fig. 1). The apex of the resource triangle represents the relatively small volumes of conventional resources that occur in reservoirs that are relatively easy and inexpensive to develop. The base of the triangle represents unconventional resources, which include tight gas sands, coalbed methane, shale gas, gas hydrates and heavy oil (Holditch 2005). Unconventional resources account for very large volumes of hydrocarbons in place, but unconventional reservoirs are comparatively difficult and expensive to develop, requiring greater technology applications and higher commodity prices to surpass economic hurdles. As conventional gas production has declined, unconventional gas production has been the largest source of recent U.S. gas supply growth, and 9 of 12 top-producing natural-gas fields in the U.S produce unconventional gas (Haskett 2005). Outside the U.S., many countries and regions are beginning to evaluate unconventional reservoirs. Many Asian countries, for example, are assessing the potential of unconventional gas reservoirs to help meet their growing energy demands in the next 30 years (Terasaki 2005). It is clear that unconventional resources will be important in meeting future world energy demands and, given the huge potential of unconventional resources (Rogner 1997), interest in unconventional reservoir characterization and evaluation is growing (Aguilera 2007).

We define our advisory system as a complex, multi-component computer program designed to provide advice, recommendations and/or best practices for a broad array of issues that describe a large and interconnected set of solutions required to develop TGS reservoirs (Wei 2009a). We plan to expand the system to include other unconventional gas reservoirs such as coal bed methane and gas shales. In real life, a human expert can use many different methods to solve a problem, such as logical reasoning, numerical simulation, rules, or personal experiences. Likewise, our advisory system uses different kinds of programming technologies to solve problems, such as the normal algorithm-based programs, database systems, fuzzy logic methods, numerical simulations and the traditional knowledge based expert systems (Wei 2009b).

Here we present a methodology for rock typing in Barnett shale by integrating geological core description with porosity, total organic carbon (TOC), mineralogy and mercury injection capillary pressure which are relatively easy to measure.  Petrophysical measurements were made on 800 plugs obtained from almost 1600 feet of core recovered from four wells from Newark East field, TX.  Lithofacies of all the plugs were assigned using the stratigraphic columns developed by Singh (2008). From the petrophysical measurements, we observe three such groups or rock types. The three rock types so formed are termed as petrofacies ‘1', ‘2' and ‘3'. Each petrofacies was found to have distinct capillary pressure curve, and microstructure determined by ESEM. Cluster analysis of the petrophysica data set also indicates that rocks can be grouped into three clusters.  Petrofacies 1 represents the best reservoir rock with high porosity, TOC and quartz content and low calcite content whereas petrofacies 3 represents the worst reservoir rock with high calcite content and low porosity and TOC. In order to verify that petrofacies 1 is indeed the best reservoir rock; we compared the thickness of the petrofacies with the overall gas production in two vertical wells. It is observed that the well with most continuous intervals of petrofacies 1, with minimum interference of petrofacies 2 and 3 over the perforated zone, produces better than the well with thick intervals of petrofacies 2 and 3 frequently separating petrofacies 1. This confirms that petrofacies 1 which is the best reservoir rock in a petrophysical sense is also a better gas producer. "

                    "title": "Assessment of the Distribution of Technically Recoverable Resources in North American Basins",
                    "abstract": "Abstract As gas production from conventional gas reservoirs in the United States decreases, the industry is turning more to the exploration and development of unconventional gas resources (UGR), especially shale gas reservoirs. This trend is expanding quickly worldwide. Unlike in many mature North American basins, where resources and reserves are well characterized, the volume of unconventional gas resources is generally unknown in most basins outside North America (frontier basins). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of North American unconventional gas resources is significant not only for identifying and understanding the quantitative distributions of recoverable UGR in North American basins, but also for estimating the volume of UGR in frontier basins. Our investigation of North American unconventional gas resources is based on the resource triangle concept, which implies that all natural resources, including oil and gas, are distributed log-normally in nature. Martin et al. (2010) described a methodology to estimate values of total recoverable resources (TRR) for unconventional gas reservoirs. In their work, the authors combined estimates of production, reserves, reserves growth, and undiscovered resources from a variety of sources into a logical distribution. They used data from 8 basins in North America to demonstrate their results. We have expanded the work of Martin et al. (2010) to include data from a total of 25 basins in North America. The results show that the overall ratio of TRR in unconventional gas reservoirs to those in conventional oil and gas reservoirs in the 25 basins is approximately 4 to 1. This means that for every Tcfe of oil and gas produced from conventional reservoirs, one could expect another 4 Tcfe to be technically recoverable from unconventional gas reservoirs in the same basin. This observation can help companies assess the potential of unconventional gas resources development in North American basins and in frontier basins worldwide.  Introduction Driven by a new understanding of the potentially huge amount of unconventional gas resources (UGR) and the feasibility of unconventional gas development, global interest in the development of unconventional gas reservoirs has been on the rise during the last few years. In North America, unconventional resources have been produced for decades and play a major role in the national energy picture. Around the world, UGRs can be found in every major oil and gas basin, but have yet to serve as the major contributor for energy supply, partly due to the scarcity of information about the exploration and development technologies required to produce UGRs (Holditch et al. 2007). Also, there are many factors, such as service company infrastructure, gas markets and low gas prices in some areas, which will inhibit development any time soon. However, to fulfill the growing global energy demand, unconventional resources outside of North America will receive more attention in coming years. To better evaluate the UGRs in North America, Martin et al. (2010) developed the software system Petroleum Resources Investigation Summary and Evaluation (PRISE). PRISE used data from 8 basins to assess total recoverable resources (TRR) in unconventional gas reservoirs (UGR) (Martin et al. 2010). In this paper, we expand the work of Martin et al. (2010) to include data from 17 additional North America basins that contain significant volumes of gas in UGRs.  PRISE Software. We improved the software developed by Martin et al. (2010) and added data from more basins in North America. The upgraded PRISE database includes evaluations of 25 North American basins, and is designed to assess the volume of gas in UGRs in frontier basins. PRISE works in conjunction with another program, BASIN, which can be used to find the North American basin most analogous to any frontier basin (Singh et al. 2008). BASIN and PRISE share a common database (Fig. 1). Once the analogous basin has been determined, PRISE uses the resource distribution of the analogous North American basin to infer the resource distribution of the frontier basin. PRISE and BASIN are components of a more general set of programs called the Unconventional Gas Advisor (UGA) (Fig. 1). "

                    "abstract": "Oilfield economic conditions today continue to emphasize the need to recognize and respond to drilling dysfunctions quickly to maximize performance and minimize well costs. It is important for drilling engineers planning wells to fully comprehend each dysfunction in order to develop a means to mitigate their impact. As progress is made in this effort, it has become increasingly clear that many issues facing the drilling industry cannot be solved or solutions implemented with traditional drilling technology and platforms. The automation of drilling data collection and control systems response is increasingly becoming a key aspect of advancing many aspects of drilling performance. SPE's Drilling Systems Automation Technical Section (DSATS) now enters its third year of an international competition for universities to design and build a small drilling rig that can operate hands-free in an unknown formation. Much like engineers in the field, students from each team must develop technical skills to understand the drilling dysfunctions that affect their rig's performance and calculate their impact on drilling performance. For the first time, in the 2017 competition, students must design and build a downhole sensor integrated into their control scheme. They have applied several different sensor types and unique telemetry techniques in custom-machined bottom-hole assemblies (BHA) that follow a 1.125 in (28.5mm) bit. The collected data is being used for vibration mitigation in real-time without human intervention. The teams realize that the measurement and control aspects of drilling are as important as the equipment design, so they must model the drilling-states to determine appropriate response algorithms. Issues must be identified, and drilling parameters adjusted before dysfunctions severely limit performance. Teams often conduct a series of structured tests in various rock types to pre-tune their drilling algorithms. With improved state-detection algorithms and new optimization techniques, the drilling parameters that maximize performance are immediately calculated and implemented. DSATS intentionally challenges each team by choosing a thin-walled pipe which limits the ability to apply weight on the bit (WOB), ultimately generating an environment that promotes bit whirl. DSATS also provides an unknown rock sample of varying material, formation dips and other \"surprises.\" This paper presents the results of on-site testing of the winning team, Texas A&M University, who drilled a high-quality wellbore in the shortest amount of time. It also details the decision-process for the rig's design, based on background lab tests and engineering calculations. "

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Numerical simulations of hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation through layered rocks show the effects of rock layering and interfaces on fracture height growth. When the contrast in properties between adjacent rock layers is high and abrupt, the resulting interface between these layers is often weak, exhibiting low tensile strength, low friction coefficient, and high hydraulic conductivity. Thus, they easily detach (in tension) and slip (in shear), as the hydraulic fracture crosses them, creating localized obstacles for fracture propagation as well as localized zones of fluid loss. Numerical simulations were conducted using the newly-implemented pore pressure cohesive elements as certain predefined hydraulic fracture and interface opening paths in ABAQUS 2016. To validate the model and for comparison we conducted simulations on elastically-homogeneous and elastically-layered rocks and, for the latter, we used a range of tensile strength and fluid flow properties at the interfaces between layers, to understand their impact on vertical hydraulic fracture (height) growth. Our results show a systematic decrease in fracture height and fracturing fluid efficiency with increasing interface hydraulic conductivity. This relationship is important because of its potential impact on improving fracture diagnostics in the field. We also observe that the interface strength directly affects fracture height growth as well as fluid efficiency. These findings are important for a proper assessment of fracture height growth, a better assessment of the created fracture surface area, and better predictions of well production. 1. INTRODUCTION Hydraulic fracturing (HF) treatments have been widely used to enhance oil and gas production (Economides and Nolte, 2000; Holditch, 2006). Improving the representation of these treatments with more adequate numerical modeling is important because it helps to increase the created fracture surface area, to reduce completion costs, and to improve well production. When considering more complex reservoirs, such as shale and mudstone, numerical simulation of the hydraulic fracture treatments is considerably more challenging because of the layered nature of the rock and the impact of the associated interfaces of contact between layers, inhomogeneity, and pre-existing natural fractures on hydraulic fracture growth.

                    "title": "Inducing Axial Vibrations in Unconventional Wells: New Insights through Comprehensive Modeling",
                    "abstract": "Axial Excitation Tools, or AETs, are known to help improve ROP in modern horizontal wells. These devices instigate an axial vibration in the drillstring, which then propagates along the length of the horizontal assembly. The improvement in ROP is thought to originate from a more effective WOB transfer due to this induced axial movement from the AET. However, the exact mechanics of how these tools affect the drillstring is not known due to a lack of adequate modeling. Additionally, little work has been done to examine the potential consequences of inducing an axial resonance within the drillstring while utilizing these types of tools. This study explores these questions through advanced dynamic modeling. Using a newly-developed, validated, comprehensive drillstring model, the dynamic response of the drillstring, due to the axial excitation provided by an AET, is examined via a forced-frequency approach. The resulting sensitivity analysis illustrates the dependence of the system on the various operational and structural characteristics of the drillstring. Parameters examined include applied WOB, wellbore trajectory, design characteristics of the AET, and various boundary conditions. Nonlinear time- domain simulations are also conducted in order to quantify how AETs affect the axial force transfer to the bit. It is shown that various operational parameters will have a noticeable impact on the dynamic response of the drillstring when inducing axial vibrations while drilling. This observation suggests the necessity to properly plan for the use of AETs in order to avoid unnecessary failures of downhole components and subsequent non-productive time (NPT). While the modeling itself is advanced, the outputs are designed to help visualize the response of the system in a \"user-friendly\" manner, reducing the learning curve and bridging the gap between the \"tech-savvy\" and non-technical personnel. This study presents an efficient way of determining the potential of harmful vibrations when drilling with an Axial Excitation Tool. The modeling approach shown is comprehensive and provides new insights into the fundamental operation of these types of tools and how axial excitations help to improve drilling efficiencies. Results presented show that induced vibrations do not simply \"reduce friction,\" as is so often claimed; instead, these tools generate a dynamic axial force, oscillating about the average value, which may help work past \"tight-spots\" along the well. In turn, this would give the impression of reduced friction along the wellbore based on hook load measurements. "

                    "abstract": "An extensive data collection, training, and field trial program was implemented to develop practices to mitigate a common form of bit damage in hard laminated formations. Analysis improved understanding of the physical phenomena causing the damage and a variety of operational practices and technical redesigns have resulted in reduced levels of bit dysfunction, increased bit life, as well as increased drill rate. In hard laminated formations, bit life is often limited by severe damage occurring in only the two outside cutter rows on the bit shoulder (Fig. 2). In 2014, the operator began a performance improvement program in the Greater Green River Basin, which included investigating the physical process through which this damage was occurring. High frequency downhole vibrations data was recorded on multiple wells at points throughout the BHA as well as at the bit. The data revealed that synchronous torsional oscillations (STO) were occurring, and these were enabling high lateral bit whirl. While the root cause is a form of stickslip, the damage observed has the appearance of whirl. Analysis showed that as the bit drilled the laminated interfaces, higher modes of STO may occur along with the basic primary torsional oscillation mode. STOs occur when the drillstring is rotated at specific speeds that cause higher frequency torsional resonance to develop in addition to the primary large torque and speed cycles that rig crews observe with stickslip. The high frequency oscillation within the drillstring had small amplitude, but it created sufficient loss of depth of cut that allowed the bit to move freely in the lateral direction, enabling high lateral vibrations. The effect is particularly pronounced in hard laminated formations where the depth of cut has already declined at each transition due to the increase in rock hardness. It has generally been observed by the industry that high levels of whirl are rarely seen simultaneously with high stickslip. The observations in the described case are significant in that they may explain those instances where they are seen together. Also, the operations personnel are generally not aware that primary and higher order torsional oscillations may be excited by specific rotary speeds and that new field practices are needed to identify and avoid these in real time. Field trials were conducted that included RPM step tests to determine non-resonant rotational speeds, WOB step tests to avoid the onset of full-stick, bits designed with depth-of-cut control to reduce torsional oscillation, roller reamers to ensure stabilizer drag wasn't contributing to stickslip, and extension of bit gauge length to reduce the lateral movement of the bit in response to lateral force from the BHA. Direct measurement, using high frequency downhole data, showed it is possible to achieve moderate reduction in bit dysfunction in hard laminated formations through these changes in practices and design. Greater gains might be expected with drillstrings having higher torsional stiffness than the 14,000 ft of 4 inch pipe used in these operations, or with less than the 5500ft of hard laminated formations. In other situations the gains would have been adequate to have enabled a bit to drill an entire interval without tripping. This work may have implications for operations in other unconventional plays, such as the Marcellus, Utica, Niobrara, Permian Basin, Haynesville, Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and Granite Wash, where laminated formations, small hole sizes, and small diameter drillpipe are common.

                    "abstract": "Since the pioneering work of Bailey and Finnie in 1960, drillstring dynamics continues to be an active area of research within the industry. While much effort is put into developing accurate descriptions of the complexities associated with the downhole environment, proper modeling of the various damping mechanisms acting on the drillstring remains underdeveloped. A typical approach to modeling the damping downhole consists of utilizing a generalized, or proportional, damping model based on measurements of the actual system response. This technique can be fairly useful when done properly but does not actually quantify the effects of various environmental or operational parameters, such as fluid characteristics or string rotation, on the overall behavior of the drilling assembly. This study presents a nonlinear, semi-analytical, fluid-force model specifically developed to account for the various downhole characteristics that contribute to energy dissipation such as pipe eccentricity, lateral velocity, rotation speed, fluid rheology, and flow rate. This new fluid-force model is combined into an already proven drillstring model which was developed to embody the fully coupled flexibility of the drillstring, arbitrary wellbore curvature, frictional contact, and complex tool geometry. Using the improved model, the paper analyzes the nonlinear behavior of drillstrings with a focus on lateral vibrations in modern unconventional wellbores. Specific attention is given to studying the damping effects on the dynamic response of the drillstring and BHA during rotation with a Rotary Steerable System (RSS). The results shown through this investigation help to quantify the dynamics associated with modern drilling operations. Effects of fluid properties, flow rate, and rotation speed on the nonlinear behavior of the drillstring are examined through numerical studies of rotating an RSS assembly in an unconventional horizontal wellbore. Through the results, it is shown that proper modeling of the fluid forces acting on the drillstring helps to explain how BHAs, under certain conditions, can be safely operated within a range of resonant frequencies. Advanced visualizations of these time-domain simulations also reveal a unique observation that could have a significant influence on expanding the drilling envelope in automated operations. "

                    "abstract": "The following paper covers work completed at Texas A&M University regarding an innovative method to quantify the rate of change in a wellbore trajectory using mechanical specific energy or MSE.  The use of MSE to anticipate the rate of change is a fresh approach to wellbore trajectory prediction using surface drilling data and is shown in our work to be an accurate predictor of dog-leg severity. The use of horizontal drilling has expanded at an almost exponential pace as it has been applied to unconventional reservoirs, and yet, the process is still done in a reactive fashion. This is to say that, many horizontal drilling decisions are still made by the directional driller using only his tally book with simple records showing the results of his prior actions.  Using the correlation presented in this paper, a system has been developed which allows for accurate prediction of the rate of change of wellbore deviation while a drillstring is being rotated ahead. Predictive models, typically centered on WOB or RPM, have been in existence for many years.  However, one parameter whose effect on wellbore deviation has not been investigated is mechanical specific energy.  MSE is a measure of the efficiency of the drilling process and has primarily been used for vibration analysis and rate of penetration optimization. Using published experimental data, a correlation was developed which shows a clear relationship between the dog-leg severity, rate of penetration (ROP) and MSE. The correlation requires only a few hundred feet of drilling before it is able to be tuned to match an individual well’s results. With minimal tuning throughout the drilling of a well, good results can be obtained with regards to forecasting dog-leg severity as the wellbores were drilled ahead. The correlation was tested using data from multiple, geo-steered wells drilled in a shale reservoir. The analysis of the correlation using real-world data proved it to be a robust and accurate method of predicting the magnitude of dog-leg severity. This work is a part of the overall industry push to understand the mechanics of what is occurring downhole and their effect on the many aspects of the drilling process.  The correlation allows for the prediction of what is now becoming a vital part of many of the wells we drill: the wellbore’s trajectory while rotating.  It works particularly well in horizontal or near-horizontal portions of the well, which is where the wellpath trajectory matters the most with regards to overall well productivity.  In addition, there are no special data requirements, only standard surface drilling parameter data.  Overall, the use of this correlation results in a smoother wellbore, drilled with a faster overall ROP with a better chance of staying within the geologic targets.

                    "abstract": "The success of petroleum development projects depends to a large degree on well construction costs. Well construction cost estimates often contain high levels of uncertainty. In many cases, these costs are estimated using deterministic methods that do not reliably account for uncertainty, leading to biased estimates. The objectives of this work were to improve the reliability of deterministic well construction cost estimates by incorporating external probabilistic methods into the estimation process. The method uses historical well cost estimates and actual costs to develop probabilistic correction factors that can be applied to future well cost estimates. These factors can be applied to the entire well cost or to individual cost components. Application of the methodology to estimation of well construction costs for horizontal Barnett shale wells in the Fort Worth basin resulted in estimated well cost estimates that were well-calibrated probabilistically. Overall, average estimated well cost using this methodology was significantly more accurate than average estimated well cost using deterministic methods. The methodology is intended for use by individual engineers to improve their well construction cost estimation and by management to externally revise and improve well cost estimates for budgeting purposes. Systematic use of this methodology will provide for more accurate and efficient allocation of capital for drilling campaigns, which could have significant impacts on reservoir development and profitability.

                    "abstract": "The most popular (and practical) approach for stimulating low/ultralow permeability reservoirs (such as shale oil and shale gas reservoirs) has followed two main strategies: (1) to drill horizontal wells to maximize the extension of the wellbore (and to minimize the number of wells), and (2) stimulate the horizontal well by multiple hydraulic fracturing treatments, which create a distribution of multiple vertical fractures along the wellbore. The effective reservoir ”system” created by a horizontal well intercepting multiple vertical fractures (i.e., the so-called ”multi-fractured horizontal well” (or MFHW)) is a challenging system to model for flow diagnosis given three factors: (1) the heterogeneous nature and low/ultralow permeability nature of the reservoir, (2) the geometry of the well and the fractures, and (3) the properties of the petroleum fluids. In this paper, we will address the first two of these points by providing semi-analytical reservoir models to represent the MFHW well case in a fractal reservoir. Our approach is to extend the models for horizontal wells intercepting multiple finite-conductivity vertical fractures in a the fractal reservoir scenario. We have restricted our work in this paper to case of a fractal reservoir with typical (i.e., normal) diffusion, as we believe that this case is more likely in theory and in practice than reservoir models which consider ”anomalous diffusion.” In this work, we show that the pressure transient response of a ”multi-fractured horizontal well” (or MFHW) within a fractal reservoir can exhibit a maximum of four (4) distinct periods of flow: (1) fracture (dominated) flow, (2) early fracture-reservoir interaction, (3) late fracture-reservoir interaction, and (4) reservoir-dominated flow. In addition, we present a discussion on considerations for the use of the ”fractal source” function as a point or line source solution. The following contributions are derived from this work: "

                    "title": "Pressure-Transient Behavior of DoublePorosity Reservoirs with Transient Interporosity Transfer with Fractal Matrix Blocks",
                    "abstract": "Double-porosity/naturally-fractured reservoir (NFRs) models have traditionally been used to represent the flow and pressure behavior for highly fractured carbonate reservoirs. Given that unconventional reservoirs such as shale oil/gas reservoirs may or may not be considered to be multi-porosity media, the use of the traditional/classical \"double-porosity\" models may not be adequate (or appropriate). The recent development of anomalous diffusion models has opened the possibility of adapting double-porosity models to estimate reservoir (and related) parameters for unconventional reservoirs. The primary objective of this work is to develop and demonstrate analytical reservoir models that provide (possible) physical explanations for the anomalous diffusion phenomenon. The models considering anomalous diffusion in reservoirs with Euclidean shape are developed using a convolved (i.e., time-dependent) version of Darcy's law. The use of these models can yield a power-law (straight-line) behavior for the pressure and/or rate performance — similar to the fractal reservoir models. The main advantage of using anomalous diffusion models compared to models considering fractal geometry is the reduction from two parameters (i.e., the Fractal Dimension and the Conductivity Index) to only one parameter (i.e., the anomalous diffusion exponent). However, the anomalous diffusion exponent does not provide information about the geometry or spatial distribution of the reservoir properties. To provide an alternative explanation for the anomalous diffusion phenomenon in petroleum reservoirs, we have developed double-porosity models considering matrix blocks with fractal geometry and fracture networks with either radial or fractal fracture networks. The flows inside the matrix blocks and the fractal fracture network assume that Darcy's Law is valid in its space-dependent (fractal) form, whereas the classical version of Darcy's Law is assumed for the radial fracture network case. The transient interporosity transfer is modeled using the classical convolution schemes given in the literature. For the system composed by a radial fracture network and fractal matrix blocks, we have investigated three cases by changing the producing conditions for the well and the flowing conditions for the matrix blocks: These three cases are: A well producing at a constant-rate and closed matrix blocks, A well producing at a constant-rate and \"infinite-acting\" matrix blocks, and A well producing at a variable-rate (time-dependent inner boundary condition) and \"infinite-acting\" matrix blocks.  We have defined the matrix blocks to be \"infinite-acting\" in order to represent the nano/micro permeability of shale reservoirs. For the system defined by a fractal fracture network and infinite-acting fractal matrix blocks, we have investigated the influence of the fractal parameters (both matrix and fracture network) in the pressure- and rate-transient performance behaviors. We have defined the periods of flow that can be observed in these sorts of systems and we have developed analytical solutions for pressure-transient analysis. We demonstrate that the use of the convolved version of Darcy's Law results in a model very similar to the diffusivity equation for double-porosity systems (which incorporates transient interporosity flow). In performing this work, we establish the following obervations/conclusions using our new solutions: We have found that the assumption of a well producing at variable-rate (time-dependent inner boundary condition) has a more significant impact on the pressure (and derivative) functions and hinders the effects of the properties of the reservoir. We have demonstrated that the anomalous diffusion phenomena in unconventional reservoirs can be related to their multi-porosity nature.

                    "title": "Pressure-Transient Behavior of a Horizontal Well with a Finite-Conductivity Fracture within a Fractal Reservoir",
                    "abstract": "The primary goal of this work is to demonstrate that the fractal geometry can be used to accurately model the rate and pressure performance behavior of highly heterogeneous reservoirs such as shale oil/gas reservoirs. There are multi-scale heterogeneities that can hinder modelling and diagnostic analyses, and the use of large stimulation treatments (e.g., multi-fractured horizontal wells) can further complicate the modeling of heterogeneous reservoir systems. The primary objective of this work is to provide analytical reservoir models and diagnostic interpretation relations that can be used to estimate the well and reservoir parameters for the case of a hydraulic fracture intercepting a horizontal well within a fractal reservoir. This work presents a semi-analytical solution for the pressure and rate transient behaviors of a horizontal well intercepting a single finite-conductivity fracture within a fractal reservoir considering either single or naturally-fractured/dual porosity reservoir conditions. The shape of the imposed hydraulic fracture can be either circular or rectangular. The media (the reservoir and the fracture) are \"coupled\" by discretizing the fracture, which defines a system of equations, the solution of which provides the pressure at any position inside the fracture. Naturally-fractured/dual porosity and anomalous diffusion effects are included by modifying the solution of the diffusivity equation for the reservoir in the Laplace domain. The diagnostic signatures (i.e., the pressure derivative functions) for the proposed semi-analytical solution illustrate the following features: Period 1 (Fracture flow): Radial or linear flow (depending on the geometry of the fracture) at very early times. As in classic studies for the case of a single finite-conductivity fracture, this period will never be observed in practice. Period 2 (Fracture-reservoir interaction): \"Radial-Fractal\" or \"Linear Fractal\" at intermediate-transient times. This period can be subdivided into two sub-periods: (1) early-intermediate and (2) late-intermediate. The early-intermediate period is analogous to the bilinear flow regime for a finite-conductivity vertical fracture in an infinite-acting homogeneous reservoir, whereas the late-intermediate is analogous to the formation-linear flow regime observed at most times for a case with a very high conductivity vertical fracture and at later times for cases with a medium to high conductivity vertical fracture. Period 3 (Reservoir dominated flow): \"Pseudo-Fractal\" flow. This flow period is dominated by the reservoir and yields power-law behavior (i.e., a straight line in the pressure drop and pressure derivative functions versus time on a log-log plot).  In this \"mechanistic\"-style of study, we found that the heterogeneities of the reservoir represented by the fractal parameters, and/or the characteristics of the fracture itself can distort the pressure response during early/very early-times. Specifically, this work shows that the interaction between the fracture and the fractal reservoir can exhibit power-law pressure drop and pressure drop derivative signatures which are different from the distinctive one-quarter slope expected for bilinear flow. The following contributions are derived from this work: Proposed solution for the pressure drop and pressure drop derivative behavior of a horizontal well intercepting a hydraulic fracture within a fractal reservoir that exhibits several \"power-law\" flow regimes. Proposed features from our analytical solution for the characteristic early-time pressure drop and pressure drop derivative responses that may be of use in the diagnostic evaluation of fracturing treatments (e.g, the effectiveness of the fracture treatment in connection with existing/enhanced natural fractures).

                    "abstract": "The numerical prediction of production from stimulated Ultra-Low Permeability (ULP) media is highly correlated with the type of fracture model used in the simulator. Although there are some general rules about the applicability of these fracture models, there are no guidelines for the a-priori selection of an appropriate model — generally, the fracture model is selected based on the preference and/or familiarity of the person performing the modeling, rather than some \"more technical\" criteria. In that light, this work presents an effort to provide guidance for fracture model suitability for cases from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, Three Forks, and Wolfcamp formations. In this work, production data from multiple wells in the aforementioned reservoirs are history-matched using models commonly available in commercial reservoir simulators. We evaluate the ability of the equivalent continuum model (ECM), the dual porosity, the dual permeability, and the multiple interactive continuum model (MINC) to represent these wells. We determine that a correlation exists between the choice of the fracture model and the reservoir. However, the results of the study do not provide a sufficiently strong indication of model superiority which would support authoritative guidelines about applicability for a particular reservoir. Ultimately the choice of the most representative model depends on the particular well. The proposed recommendationsprovide guidance onthe appropriate fracture model to represent the studied reservoirs, thus enhancing their usefulness in the completion design process and the evaluation and prediction of production.

                    "abstract": "The understanding of proppant transport in fractures plays a critical role in estimating propped fracture dimensions and performance. Modeling of such processes is challenging because of the complex interactions between fluid, proppant particles and fracture geometry. Existing models generally assume vertical planar fracture geometry, whereas the reality in the subsurface maybe much more complex. In this study we use discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate that interactions between proppant particles and fracture side walls play an important role in proppant transport efficiency. To calibrate our numerical model, we conducted two validation simulations that describe particle settling tests and laboratory proppant transport experiments. Through scoping calculations, we determined the correct drag force model and matched both analytical solutions and experimental data for a wide range of flow regimes. We then constructed two hydraulic fracture simulation domains, one with a vertical planar fracture (as a base case), and the other with an inclined planar hydraulic fracture. In the main component of our study, we conducted proppant transport simulations using our benchmarked models in both domains and compared the proppant distribution results. By analyzing the velocity and trajectory of proppant particles during transport, we identified two different stages of the proppant transport process - a \"suspension\" stage and a \"settling\" stage. During the suspension stage, fluid drag and gravitational forces dominate, driving proppants further into the fracture. When the proppants collide with existing proppants dunes, the proppant particles lose momentum and become \"settled.\" Our results show that settled proppant are more difficult to be mobilized by fluid drag force, for the reason that kinetic energy is easily dissipated inside proppant dunes. Finally, we observed that proppant settles slower in inclined planar fractures, due to the supporting force from fracture side walls cancelling part of the gravitational force which act on the particle. This leads to a better proppant placement efficiency in inclined fractures. The objective of this work is to provide a better understanding of proppant transport behavior in inclined planar fractures by means of numerical simulation. A significant difference from prior (laboratory) experiments is the capability of our model to simulate proppant transport at field-scale flowrates. Such acapability is critical in understanding proppant transport and appropriately designing it by ensuring that the correct Reynolds number and flow regime are used in the design calculations. "

                    "abstract": "During the 1990s, field and laboratory experiments measured hydraulic fracture creation, propagation, and closure, and the archived data represent the finest collection of measurements that can be used to evaluate fracture models and fracture closure interpretation methodologies. None of the current fracture closure interpretation methods, including G-function derivative analysis, log-log storage diagnostics, and the changing-compliance method have been evaluated versus the field and laboratory measured data. Recent papers have proposed fracture closure pressure interpretations that differ from established methodologies, and under some circumstances, will result in a closure pressure that is higher than traditionally accepted. Thus, it seems an opportune time to reexamine the field and laboratory fracture closure data using interpretation methodologies developed over the last twenty years. Additional issues cloud closure pressure interpretations, including different definitions of fracture closure used in numerous publications, like mechanical fracture closure, hydraulic fracture closure, progressive fracture closure, and complete fracture closure. Evidence from downhole tiltmeters and finely-instrumented laboratory experiments of fracture propagation and closure all demonstrate that residual width is retained after closure. Consequently, closure is somewhat of a misnomer, and if a \"closed\" fracture remains open, the relationship between what we interpret as fracture closure and the minimum horizontal stress needs to be clearly defined based on measurements as opposed to simulation. Based on field tiltmeter deformation and pressure measurements in hard rock formations, we find that G-function derivative analysis and the log-log storage diagnostic plot interpretations together provide a fracture closure pressure that is consistent with the minimum horizontal stress identified using tiltmeter-measured rock deformation. Additionally, the closure pressure interpretations, and corresponding minimum horizontal stress, are invariant over multiple injection/falloff sequences of varying volume and time. Field experiments exhibiting variable-storage/changing-compliance signatures were also observed, and the changing-compliance method interpretations of fracture closure pressure are inconsistent with tiltmeter-measured rock deformation. Finally, we find the fracture re-opening pressure identified using tiltmeter deformation and the fracture closure pressure interpreted using pressure falloff data are essentially equal. Based on laboratory measurements of fracture closure and pressure, we find that G-function derivative analysis and the log-log storage diagnostic plot together provide a fracture closure interpretation generally consistent with measured fracture closure, but despite attempts to define an objective closure identification methodology, fracture closure signatures are often non-distinct and interpretations are subjective. In soft rock reservoirs, like unconsolidated sand, the fracture closure pressure interpretation does not correspond to the minimum horizontal stress, but in hard rock reservoirs, the fracture closure pressure identified using G-function derivative analysis and log-log storage diagnostic interpretations are approximately equal to the imposed minimum horizontal stress.

Non-Newtonian fluids are classified as non-time dependent and time-dependent fluids. This paper focuses on the non-time dependent classification, specifically pseudoplastic fluids. The ranges in these fluids allow the proposed model to be validated. The new reservoir model accounts for non-Newtonian behavior within a double-porosity reservoir. This model demonstrates an interporosity transfer function for pseudosteady state, based on a new parameter: dimensionless matrix contribution (D). This parameter differentiates our method from previous efforts based on the pseudosteady state interporosity flow for Newtonian fluids introduced in the 1960's. We derive the partial differential equation for a non-Newtonian flow within a double porosity reservoir under pseudosteady state interporosity transfer conditions. The solution presented is for an infinite acting reservoir (assuming the corresponding initial, inner and outer conditions). The objective of this paper is to deliver and provide tools that may help to characterize double porosity reservoir under the condition that a non-Newtonian fluid is present, and the interporosity transfer conditions between a matrix system and a fracture system are in pseudosteady-state.

                    "abstract": "We began this research by asking \"Can we use Bayes' theorem to supplement available decline models and improve the accuracy of our estimates of ultimate recovery?\" This study focuses on the Eagle Ford Shale, and in particular, on oil wells in the Greater Core Eagle Ford Area. Our goal was to develop a method based on a probabilistic approach to identify, characterize, and better model well production based on standard decline models To attempt to answer this question, we first obtained data for 68 wells in the Greater Core of the Eagle Ford Shale, Texas. As process, we eliminated the wells that did not have enough production data, wells that did not show a production decline and wells that had too much data noise, leaving eight wells. We then performed decline curve analysis (DCA) using the Modified Hyperbolic (MH) and Power-Law Exponential (PLE) models (the two most common DCA models), consisting in user-guided analysis software. Then, the Bayesian paradigm was implemented to calibrate the same two models on the same set of wells. The primary focus of the research was the implementation of the Bayesian paradigm on the eight-well data set. We first performed a \"best fit\" parameter estimation using least squares optimization, which provided an optimized set of parameters for the two decline models. This was followed by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration of the Bayesian posterior function for each model, which provided a full probabilistic description of its parameters. This allowed for the simulation of a number of likely realizations of the decline curves, from which first order statistics were computed to provide a confidence metric on the calibration of each model as applied to the production data of each well. Results showed variation on the calibration of the MH and PLE models. The forward models (MH and PLE) overestimated the ultimate recovery in the majority of the wells compared with the Bayesian calibrations, proving that the Bayesian paradigm was able to capture a more accurate trend of the data and thus able to determine more accurate estimates of reserves. In industry, the same decline models are used for unconventional wells as for conventional wells, even though we know that the same models may not apply. Based on the proposed results, we believe that Bayesian inference yields more accurate estimates of ultimate recovery for unconventional reservoirs than deterministic DCA methods. Moreover, it provides a measure of confidence on the prediction of production as a function of varying data and varying decline models. "

Numerous studies were performed to describe the storage and transport of hydrocarbons through ultra-small pores in the shale reservoirs. Most of these studies were developed by modifying techniques used for conventional reservoirs. The common pore-sized distribution of the shale reservoirs is approximately 1 to 20 nm and in such confined spaces that the interactions between the wall of the container (i.e., the shale and kerogen) and the contained fluids (i.e., the hydrocarbon fluids and water) may exert significant influence on the localized phase behavior. We believe this is because the orientation and distribution of fluid molecules in the confined space are different from those of the bulk fluid, causing changes in the localized thermodynamic properties. This study provides a detailed account of the changes of pressure/volume/temperature properties and phase behavior (specifically, the phase diagrams) in a synthetic shale reservoir for pure hydrocarbons (methane and ethane) and a simple methane/ethane (binary) mixture. Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed to study the effect of confinement on the fluid properties. A graphite slab made of two layers is used to represent kerogen in the shale reservoirs. The separation between the two layers, representing a kerogen pore, is varied from 1 to 10 nm to observe the changes of the hydrocarbon-fluid properties. In this paper, the critical properties of methane and ethane as well as the methane/ethane mixture phase diagrams in different pore sizes are derived from the GCMC simulations. In addition, the GCMC simulations are used to investigate the deviations of the fluid densities in the confined space from those of the bulk fluids at reservoir conditions. Although not investigated in this work, such deviations may indicate that significant errors for production forecasting and reserves estimation in shale reservoirs may occur if the (typical) bulk densities are used in reservoir-engineering calculations.

We estimate reservoir and completion properties — specifically: formation permeability, fracture-face skin effect, fracture half-length, and fracture conductivity. We correlate these results with known completion variables — specifically: completed lateral length, total proppant, total water used, and type of hydraulic fracturing fluid. We use the time-rate and time-rate-pressure analyses to forecast future production and to estimate ultimate recovery. Finally, we apply pressure transient analysis methods to those cases where the production history contains shut-in periods of sufficient duration to provide resolution in the pressure build-up data to identify reservoir features and qualitatively validate completion effectiveness. It is noted that ONLY surface pressures are available for the wells considered in this study. We utilize industry-standard software to perform single well rate-time \"decline curve\" analyses. The traditional \"modified-hyperbolic\" time-rate model was used as the \"basis\" relation and the \"power-law exponential\" time-rate model was used as a check/validation (the power-law exponential model tends to be a more conservative relation for generating forecasts and estimating ultimate recovery). We also utilize industry-standard software to perform single well time-rate-pressure \"model-based\" analyses --- this methodology is also known as Rate Transient Analysis (RTA). In this work we used the full analytical model for the performance of a Multi-Fracture Horizontal Well (as opposed to a proxy or numerical model). We use Microsoft Excel and a commercial statistical software package to correlate the production analysis results with the measured completion parameters to create \"design\" relations for well completions — specifically correlations of estimated ultimate recovery with completion variables (completed lateral length, total proppant, total water used, and type of hydraulic fracturing fluid). Finally, we utilize industry-standard software to perform pressure transient analysis on the cases where the quality and relevance of the shut-in pressure data warranted such analyses. In this work, we \"cross-validate\" the estimated ultimate recovery results by comparison of the time-rate and time-rate-pressure analysis results The correlation of EUR with completion variables, we propose, is shown to be statistically relevant for almost all combinations of variables, and the correlation relation should be applicable for creating completion designs. The analysis of surface-derived pressure transient data is successfully demonstrated for several cases taken from the gas condensate region of the Eagle Ford Shale (S. Texas). The work we perform in this thesis clearly demonstrates the validity of using empirical (time-rate) and analytical (time-rate-pressure) analysis methods for the purpose of characterizing well performance for wells in the gas condensate region of the Eagle Ford Shale (S.

Multiphase flow in deformable porous media is a multiphysics problem that considers the flow physics and rock physics simultaneously. To model this problem, the multiphase flow equations and geomechanical equilibrium equation must be tightly coupled. Conventional finite element modeling of coupled flow and geomechanics does not conserve mass locally since it uses continuous basis functions. Mixed finite element discretization that satisfies local mass conservation of the flow equation can be a good solution for this problem. In addition, the stabilized finite element method for discretizing the saturation equation minimizes numerical diffusion and provides better resolution of saturation solution. In this work, we developed a coupled multiphase flow and geomechanics solver that solves fully coupled governing equations, namely pressure, velocity, saturation, and geomechanical equilibrium equations. The solver can deal with full tensor permeability and elastic stiffness for modeling a highly heterogeneous reservoir system. The results of the numerical experiments are very encouraging. We used the solver to simulate a reservoir system that has very heterogeneous permeability and elastic stiffness fields and found that the numerical solution captures the complex multiphysics of the system. In addition, we obtained higher resolution of saturation solution than with the conventional finite volume discretization. This would help us make a better estimate of the numerical solution of complex multiphysics problems. "

                    "abstract": "The premise of this work is the development, validation, and application of a methodology to forecast production data in unconventional reservoirs where variable rate and pressure drop producing conditions are typically observed.  In unvonentional reservoirs, it is not common practice to maintain or even arrive quickly upon a constant flowing bottomhole pressure which is the primary assumption for the application of traditional time-rate decline curve analysis.  As a result the application of traditional time-rate relations to these cases yields misleading results (i.e., EUR values) at best. Our methodology involves the application of the rigorous convolution/superposition theory with the pressure drop normalized \"empirical\" rate decline relations as the \"well/reservoir\" model and the \"measured/calculated\" pressure drop data.  Diagnostic plots of the loss ratio and the loss ratio derivative, or the so called \"qDb\" plots, are utilized to minimize the non-uniqueness inherent in the history matching process by providing guidance in the selection of rate decline model parameters.  Following the selection of model parameters, the normalized rate decline relations are superposed with pressure (or pseudopressure) drop data to achieve a history match and, correspondingly, a production forecast. Validation and application of the methodology is demonstrated using a variety of synthtic data generated to closely represent common operational practices in tight/shale oil and gas plays.  A special emphasis is placed on handling non-linearities and performing sensitivities to account for future drawdown management.  We show that the methodology effectively removes pressure variations from the rate history for each of the synthetic examples presented.  We present our results using a variety of diagnostic and forecasting plots and both the magnitude of the EUR and the shape of the production profile for all cases. Introduction Decline curve analysis (DCA), or the extrapolation of only \"time-rate\" production data into the future, is one of the most commonly used techniques in the petroleum industry to estimate ultimate recovery (EUR) for producing wells.  Essentially decline curve analysis refers to the calibration of a time-rate model, or decline curve, to a single well (or multiple wells) and extrapolating production to an abandonment limit to yield an estimate of ultimate recovery. he simplicity of the method along with the fact that production from conventional reservoirs honors most of the underlying assumptions have led to Arps' hyperbolic and exponential decline curve relations becoming the industry standard for production forecasts (Arps 1945).  Johnson and Bollens (1927) laid the foundation for the exponential and hyperbolic relations when they introduced the loss ratio and the derivative of the loss ratio which are given below.

This study provides a detailed account of the changes of PVT properties and phase behavior (specifically, the phase diagrams) in a synthetic shale reservoir for pure hydrocarbons (methane and ethane) and a simple methane-ethane (binary) mixture.  Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are performed to study the effect of confinement on the fluid properties.  A graphite slab made of two layers is used to represent kerogen in the shale reservoirs.  The separation between the two layers, representing a kerogen pore, is varied from 1 nm to 10 nm to observe the changes of the hydrocarbon fluid properties.  In this paper, the critical properties of methane and ethane as well as the methane-ethane mixture phase diagrams in different pore sizes are derived from the GCMC simulations.  In addition, the GCMC simulations are used to investigate the deviations of the fluid densities in the confined space from those of the bulk fluids at reservoirs conditions.  While not investigated in this work, such deviations may indicate that significant errors for production forecasting and reserve estimation in shale reservoirs may occur if the (typical) bulk densities are used in reservoir engineering calculations. Introduction Over the past decade, the main focus of the petroleum industry has to develop the technology exploit shale reservoirs.  Unlike conventional sandstone and carbonate reservoirs, shale reservoirs have unique rock properties — in particular, ultra-low in-situ permeabilities (on the order of 1-100 nd is very common).  Shale reservoirs contain nano-scale sized pores, which leads to the ultra-low permeabilities, but also some very unusual phase behavior caused by \"confinement\" in very small pores. Consequently, it is nearly impossible to extract hydrocarbon fluids from shale reservoirs without substantial \"stimulation\" of the formation, and the current favored model is that of the multi-fractured horizontal well.  The ultra-low permeability nature of these reservoirs, combined with the requirement of significant reservoir stimulation to achieve commercial flowrates has led to the descriptor of \"unconventional reservoirs\" for shale gas and liquids-rich shale reservoirs. As noted, numerous studies have been performed to describe the storage and transport of hydrocarbons in shale reservoirs; in particular to improve reserves estimation and production forecasts.  Desorption-adsorption models (e.g., the Langmuir model) are added in numerical reservoir simulation and gas-in-place calculation to account for adsorbed gas in shales (Shabro et al. 2011; Ambrose et al. 2011; Ambrose et al. 2012; Das et al.).  In ultra-small pores, turbulent flow may develop and cause deviation from the conventional models (i.e., Darcy's equation).  Knudsen's number is used to characterize slip and no-slip flow and Knudsen diffusion and slip flow models are incorporated to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation (Freeman 2010; Shabro et al. 2011; Darabi et al. 2012, Fathi et al. 2012).  However, most of these studies were developed by modifying techniques used for conventional reservoirs — only a few of these studies consider the fundamental effects of pore size on hydrocarbon PVT properties and flow behavior (i.e., storage and transport of fluids).

                    "abstract": "Low- to ultralow-permeability formations require \"special\" treatments/stimulation to make them produce economical quantities of hydrocarbon, and at the moment, multistage hydraulic fracturing (MSHF) is the most commonly used stimulation method for enhancing the exploitation of these reservoirs. Recently, the slot-drill (SD) completion technique was proposed as an alternative treatment method in such formations (Carter 2009). This paper documents the results of a comprehensive numerical-simulation study conducted to evaluate the production performance of the SD technique and compare its performance to that of the standard MSHF approach. We investigated three low-permeability formations of interest--namely, a shale-gas formation, a tight-gas formation, and a tight/shale-oil formation. The simulation domains were discretized with Voronoi-gridding schemes to create representative meshes of the different reservoir and completion systems modeled in this study. The results from this study indicated that the SD method does not, in general, appear to be competitive in terms of reservoir performance and recovery compared with the more traditional MSHF method. Our findings indicate that the larger surface area to flow that results from the application of MSHF is much more significant than the higher conductivity achieved by use of the SD technique. However, there may exist cases, for example, lack of adequate water volumes for hydraulic fracturing, or very high irreducible water saturation that leads to adverse relative permeability conditions and production performance, in which the low-cost SD method may make production feasible from an otherwise challenging (if not inaccessible) resource.

This program is unique in that it is a working partnership amongst the sponsor (AMA1), the education entity (UEM), and a team of renowned U.S.-based faculty. Historically, multinational companies would simply make philanthropic contributions to a local institution and then turn their focus on their core business. Today, all parties expect more from each other; host governments and their industry partners want equal input on where and how social responsibility projects are directed, including which projects should be undertaken.  Likewise, the beneficiaries of these contributions are requesting increased levels of involvement and assistance to deliver maximum benefits for their constituents. This is the situation in Mozambique; all of the parties--the government, the University of Eduardo Mondlane (UEM), and Anadarko Mozambique Area 1 (AMA1)--have agreed to and fully support this collaborative development model. The goal of this project is to provide an approach which fully meets the academic standards and rigor of a world-class post-graduate degree program in Petroleum Engineering while providing sustainable capability development in terms of the students and the faculty. This model relies on the commitment of all parties to achieve \"steady-state\" in as short a time as possible; in this case, the planned time-scale from inception to independence is on the order of four years. At present, the project is on schedule with two cohorts of students and seven UEM faculty progressing. "

                    "abstract": "Production of low-viscosity liquids (including condensates) from tight reservoirs (such as shales) is severely restricted by the ultra low-permeability of such formations, limiting production to a very small fraction (usually less than 5 percent) of the liquids-in-place. In this study, which is part of a wider investigation, we evaluate by means of numerical simulation several possible strategies to enhance low-viscosity liquids production from such reservoirs. These strategies include (a) physical displacement processes, (b) non-thermal processes to reduce the viscosity and the critical saturation of the liquids, (c) thermal processes, (d) enhanced reservoir stimulation, (e) novel well configurations and (f) combinations thereof. The objectives of this effort are to (1) to remove from further consideration potential production strategies that hold limited (if any) promise, and (2) to identify production strategies that appear to have potential for further study and development. We first determine the baseline production performance of such reservoirs corresponding to several reference production regimes that involve minimal or no reservoir stimulation, standard displacement fluids (H2O or CH4), standard well configurations and no thermal treatment. We then evaluate the efficiency of several production strategies: (a) traditional continuous gas flooding using parallel horizontal wells and using the currently abundant shale gas, (b) water-alternating-gas (WAG) flooding, (c) huff-and-puff injection/production strategies using lean gas/rich gas in a traditional (single) horizontal well with multiple fractures, (d) flooding using appropriate gases (e.g., CO2, N2, CH4) using appropriate well configurations (mainly horizontal), with the viscosity reduction resulting from the gas dissolution into the liquids, and (e) thermal processes, in which the viscosity reduction is achieved by heating, possibly to the point of liquid vaporization and transport through the matrix to the production wells as a gas. Our study includes an analysis of the sensitivity of the liquids production to the main parameters defining each of the strategies listed above in an effort to determine the critically important parameters and factors that control the production performance and efficiency.

                    "abstract": "The premise of this work is the development and application of a new methodology to forecast production data in unconventional reservoirs where variable rate and pressure drop data are typically observed throughout production.  Decline curve analysis techniques for the estimation of ultimate recovery (EUR) require the constant bottomhole pressure condition during the producing life of the well — whereas it is not regular practice to maintain a constant bottomhole pressure profile throughout production in unconventional reservoirs.  Therefore, the applicability of the time-rate decline relations is questionable, and methods to remove pressure variations from rate response are needed for generating future production forecasts. From a conceptual view point, we propose the utilization of the convolution/superposition theory along with the recently developed \"empirical\" time-rate equations, which are normalized by pressure drop data.  In order to avoid non-uniqueness, a workflow is used where model parameters for the \"normalized\" decline curve equations are identified using diagnostic \"qDb\" plots.  Normalized decline curve equations are then convolved with the pressure drop data to achieve a history match and to forecast production. We provide demonstrative application of this technique using an example from an high pressure high temperature shale gas reservoir.  For varying bottomhole pressure cases, we show that our proposed techniques effectively remove pressure variations from the rate history.  We present the differences in computed EUR values using decline curve analysis with and without corrections for varying pressures.  In addition, forecasts are generated using supplementary plots such as pressure drop normalized rate versus cumulative production.

We also developed anumerical simulator of gas flow through tight porous media, and used severalVoronoi grids to assess the potential performance of such irregular fractureson gas production from unconventional gas reservoirs. Our simulations involvedup to a half-million cells, and we considered production periods that areorders of magnitude longer than the expected productive life of wells andreservoirs. Our aim was to describe a wide range of flow regimes that can beobserved in irregular fracture patterns, and to fully assess even nuances inflow behavior. We investigated coupled primary/secondary fractures, withmultiple/vertical hydraulic fractures intersecting horizontal secondary\"stress-release\" fractures. We studied irregular fracture patterns to show theeffect of fracture angularity and nonplanar fracture configurations onproduction. The results indicate that the presence of high-conductivitysecondary fractures results in the highest increase in production, whereas,contrary to expectations, strictly planar and orthogonal fractures yield betterproduction performance than nonplanar and nonorthogonal fractures withequivalent propped-fracture lengths.

                    "abstract": "Various analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical models have been proposed to characterize rate and pressure behavior as a function of time in tight gas and shale gas systems featuring horizontal wells with multiple hydraulic fractures. Despite a few analytical models, as well as a small number of published numerical studies, there is currently little consensus regarding the large-scale flow behavior over time in such systems, particularly regarding the dominant flow regimes and whether or not reservoir properties or volumes can be estimated from well performance data. We constructed a fit-for-purpose numerical simulator which accounts for a variety of production features pertinent to these systems—specifically ultra-tight matrix permeability, hydraulically fractured horizontal wells with induced fractures of various configurations, multiple porosity and permeability fields, and desorption. These features cover the production mechanisms which are currently believed to be most relevant in tight gas and shale gas systems. We employ the numerical simulator to examine various tight gas and shale gas systems and to identify and illustrate the various flow regimes which progressively occur over time. We perform this study at fine grid discretization on the order of 1 mm near fractures to accurately capture flow effects at all time periods. We visualize the flow regimes using specialized plots of rate and pressure functions, as well as maps of pressure and sorption distributions. We use pressure maps to visualize the various flow regimes and their transitions in tight gas systems. In a typical tight gas system, we illustrate the initial linear flow into the hydraulic fractures (i.e., formation linear flow), transitioning to compound formation linear flow, and eventually transforming into elliptical flow. We explore variations of possible shale gas system models. Based on diffusive flow (with and without desorption), we show that due to the extremely low permeability of shale matrix (a few nanodarcies), the flow behavior is dominated by the extent of and configuration of the fractures. This work expands our understanding of flow behavior in tight gas and shale gas systems, where such an understanding may ultimately be used to estimate reservoir properties and reserves in these types of reservoirs.

Sophisticated analytic models are needed to accurately describe fluid flow in a hydraulic fracture, and the problem has been approached from different directions in the past 3 decades--starting with the work of Gringarten et al. (1974) for an infinite-conductivity case, followed by contributions from Cinco-Ley et al. (1978), Lee and Brockenbrough (1986), Ozkan and Raghavan (1991), and Blasingame and Poe (1993) for a finite-conductivity case. This topic remains an active area of research and, for the more-complicated physical scenarios such as multiple transverse fractures in ultratight reservoirs, answers are currently being sought. Starting with the seminal work of Chang and Yortsos (1990), fractal theory has been successfully applied to pressure-transient testing, although with an emphasis on the effects of natural fractures in pressure/rate behavior. In this paper, we begin by performing a rigorous analytical and numerical study of the fractal diffusivity equation (FDE), and we show that it is more fundamental than the classic linear and radial diffusivity equations. Thus, we combine the FDE with the trilinear flow model (Lee and Brockenbrough 1986), culminating in a new semianalytic solution for flow in a finite-conductivity vertical fracture that we name the \"fractal-fracture solution (FFS).\" This new solution is instantaneous and comparable in accuracy with the Blasingame and Poe solution (1993). In addition, this is the first time that fractal theory is used in fluid flow in a porous medium to address a problem not related to reservoir heterogeneity. Ultimately, this project is a demonstration of the untapped potential of fractal theory; our approach is flexible, and we believe that the same methodology could be extended to different applications. One objective of this work is to develop a fast and accurate semianalytical solution for flow in a single vertical fracture that fully penetrates a homogeneous infinite-acting reservoir. This would be the first time that fractal theory is used to study a problem that is not related to naturally fractured reservoirs or reservoir heterogeneity. In addition, as part of the development process, we revisit the fundamentals of fractals in reservoir engineering and show that the underlying FDE possesses some interesting qualities that have not yet been comprehensively addressed in the literature.

Reservoir characteristics related to storage and fluid flow that were addressed included: adsorbed and free-gas storage; single-phase flow of water above desorption pressure (undersaturated coals); 2-phase flow of gas and water below desorption pressure (saturated coals); non-static absolute permeability during depletion; and multi-layer behavior. Example (field) applications of the new PDA methods were limited to vertical wells that were either openhole completed, or slightly stimulated with hydraulic fracturing methods. In this work, new workflows and analytical approaches are provided for analyzing vertical, hydraulically-fractured and horizontal CBM wells. The analysis and methodology for 2-phase flow reservoirs is complex, requiring modifications to account for desorption and changes in effective permeability. The proposed workflow for 2-phase CBM wells includes the transformation of the well production and flowing pressure data into dimensionless type-curve and straight line (ex. flowing material balance) coordinates using certain outputs (krg, pR) from the simulator used in turn to history-match the production data. Transient straight-line (pressure-transient analysis analog) techniques are applied for the first time to 2-phase CBM well production data. The type-curve and straight-line matches to actual production data are then used to retrieve reservoir properties (e.g. absolute permeability) and stimulation conditions (e.g. skin), which in turn are compared to reservoir simulation input as a consistency check. Both simulated and field cases are analyzed to illustrate the new procedures and analytical techniques. The primary contribution of the current work is the application of modern production analysis methods to 2-phase CBM reservoirs. These methods have been modified for CBM reservoir behavior and combined with analytical (or numerical) modeling to extract quantitative reservoir information from CBM reservoirs which exhibit a wide-range in production characteristics, and are completed in a variety of styles. The modifications proposed in this work to enable the use of single-phase flow techniques must be regarded as practical approximations. The methods rely heavily on late-time data because of the poor quality of water production and flowing pressure data that typically exists. The methods are expected to be used as a pre-cursor to or in parallel with field reservoir simulation, to assist with CBM development decisions. "

Determining well/reservoir properties; ?? Establishing completion effectiveness; and ?? Estimating future production.  The Eagle Ford Shale presents additional difficulty in the form of fluid behavior characterization.  Near-critical PVT behavior (as in the case of the Eagle Ford Shale) is an important component of well performance, which cannot be overlooked during analysis and modeling.  The results of this work address the common challenges encountered during production analysis and modeling of the Eagle Ford shale wells.  In particular, it is shown that significant differences are observed in production forecast due to characterization of the fluid.  This work provides a systematic workflow to analyze and forecast production data in near-critical reservoirs with examples from the Eagle Ford Shale and delivers more insight into analysis of production data in unconventional \"liquids-rich\" reservoirs, and offers to decrease the uncertainty related with production forecast that is mainly caused by lack of understanding of \"near-critical\" fluid behavior.  Introduction  Eagle Ford Shale has been a success story of the oil and gas industry in North America beginning 2008 with the drilling of the wells targeting the Eagle Ford Shale play.  Eagle Ford Shale covers approximetely 11 million acres extending from Texas-Mexico border to the eastern borders of Gonzales and Lavaca counties in Texas.  Up to date thousands of wells have been drilled, which have been on production from the Eagle Ford Shale.  Formation thickness varies from 50 ft in the northeast to more than 300 ft in the southwest along its northeast to southwest depositional trend (Fan et al 2011).  Austin Chalk field to the south was sourced by the Eagle Ford Shale along with the East Texas field located in the East Texas Salt basin. Eagle Ford Shale went through three maturation windows (oil window, transition between oil and gas windows (condensate window) and gas window) as it dips south.  Therefore, different fluid types (e.g., gas rich, liquids rich areas) are encountered in production depending on the location of production.  The Eagle Ford Shale is a unique play due to difference in the types of reservoir fluids ranging from dry gas to black oil.  Particularly, in some areas (transition zone - condensate area) near-critical pvt behavior is observed.  From a drilling and completions point of view, wells are drilled and completed in a similar way, but hydraulic fracture treatments are different depending on the fluid type - for example, slickwater fluid system is pumped for gas rich areas, whereas hybrid or crosslink fluid system with higher proppant concentrations are pumped for the liquids-rich areas (Bazan et al 2010).

                    "abstract": " The application of \"Decline Curve Analysis\" (DCA) in unconventional reservoirs is almost always problematic.  The Arps relations (hyperbolic and exponential relations) have been the standard for evaluating estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) in petroleum engineering applications for more than 80 years.  However; with the pursuit of low and ultra-low permeability plays, these relations often yield ambiguous results due to invalid assumptions (e.g., existence of the boundary-dominated flow regime, presumption of a constant bottomhole pressure, etc.). Misapplications of the Arps' relations to production data exhibiting long-term, transient flow generally results in significant overestimates of reserves — specifically when the hyperbolic relation is extrapolated unconstrained, using an Arps b-value greater than 1.  We note that the \"modified hyperbolic\" relation — one with an initial (unconstrained) hyperbolic trend used during early times, coupled with an exponential decline trend using a standard terminal decline can be used effectively (with proper care) for predicting EUR and production extrapolations.  However; we note that this approach is \"non-unique\" in the hands of most users, and often yields widely varying estimates of reserves with time, and/or \"consistent\" estimates of reserves, which are highly biased. In short, the modified hyperbolic relation can be effectively applied to production data from low/ultra-low permeability reservoirs systems, these analyses must be based on diagnostic interpretations of the data (as we have proposed earlier [Ilk et al. (2008)]), where multiple data functions are used to define the analyses.  The use of diagnostics is a necessary, not a sufficient condition — the underlying models must be able to characterize the selected flow regimes, and there must also be constraints applied to production extrapolations and EUR predictions. The issues related to the use of Arps' rate decline relations have led various authors [Ilk et al. (Power Law Exponential, 2008), Valkó (Stretched Exponential, 2009), Clark et al. (Logistic Growth Model, 2011), and Duong (2011)] to propose various rate decline relations which attempt to properly model the time-rate behavior — specifically early transient and transitional flow behavior.  However, none of these equations can be considered sufficient to forecast production for all unconventional plays, due to the characteristics and operational conditions of each play and the behavior of the time-rate equation.  In other words, one equation could work very well in a specific play, but could possibly perform poorly in another play.  Under these circumstances, it is critical to understand the behavior of each equation, and to apply these relations appropriately for production forecasts. This work presents guidelines for the application of the various time-rate relations currently being deployed in the petroleum industry.  The results of time-rate analyses of wells from three different plays are presented, and the advantages/ disadvantages of each time-rate relation are discussed.  Ultimately, our goal in this work is to define and demonstrate a process for the proper application of the time-rate analyses typically performed for production forecasting and EUR prediction.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Few attempts have been made to model shale gas reservoirs on a compositional basis. Multiple distinct micro-scale physical phenomena influence the transport and storage of reservoir fluids in shale, including differential desorption, preferential Knudsen diffusion, and capillary critical effects. Concerted, these phenomena cause a measureable compositional change in the produced gas over time.  We developed a compositional numerical model capable of describing the coupled processes of diffusion and desorption in ultra-tight rocks as a function of pore size. The model captures the various fracture configurations believed to be induced by shale gas fracture stimulations. By combining the macro-scale (reservoir-scale fractures) and micro-scale (diffusion through nanopores) physics, we show how gas composition changes spatially and temporally during production.  We compare our numerical model against measured gas composition data obtained at regular intervals from shale gas wells. We utilize the characteristic behavior illustrated in the model results to identify and to define features in the measured data. We present a workflow for the integration of measured gas composition data into production data analysis tools in order to develop a more complete well performance diagnostic process.  The onset of fracture interference in horizontal wells with multiple transverse hydraulic fractures is shown to be uniquely identified by distinct fluctuations in the flowing gas composition. Using these measured composition data, the timescale and durations of the transitional flow regimes in shales are quantified, even for high levels of noise in the rate and pressure data. Reservoir properties are inferred from the integration of the compositional shift analysis of this work with modern production analysis.  This work expands the current understanding of well performance for shale gas to include physical phenomena that lead to compositional change. This may be used to optimize fracture and completion design, improve well performance analysis and provide more accurate reserves estimation.  This work demonstrates a numerical model which captures multicomponent desorption, diffusion, and phase behavior in ultra-tight rocks. We identify and validate diagnostic trends via high-resolution composition, saturation and pressure maps. We provide a workflow for incorporating measured gas composition data into modern production analysis. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Various models featuring horizontal wells with multiple fractures have been proposed to characterize flow behavior over time in tight and shale gas systems. Currently, only very little is known about the effects of nonideal fracture patterns and coupled primary-secondary fracture interactions on reservoir performance in unconventional gas reservoirs.  We developed a 3D Voronoi mesh-maker that provides the flexibility to accurately represent various complex and irregular fracture patterns. A numerical model was developed based on such fracture concepts to assess the potential performance of unconventional gas reservoirs. We conducted simulations using up to a half-million cells and considered production periods that are orders of magnitude longer than the expected life of wells and reservoirs. Our aim is to account for a wide range of flow regimes that can be observed in irregular fracture patterns, and to fully assess even slight nuances in flow behavior.  We investigated coupled primary-secondary fractures, with multiple vertical hydraulic fractures intersecting horizontal secondary \"stress-release\" fractures. We studied irregular fracture patterns to show the effect of fracture angularity and nonplanar fracture configurations on production. The results indicate that the presence of high-conductivity secondary fractures results in the highest increase in production, while, contrary to expectations, strictly planar and orthogonal fractures yield better production performance than nonplanar and nonorthogonal fractures with equivalent propped fracture lengths.  Introduction Various analytical and semi-analytical solutions have been proposed to model flow in shale-gas and tight-gas reservoirs. Gringarten (1971) and Gringarten et al., (1974) developed some of the early analytical models for flow through domains involving a single vertical fracture and a single horizontal fracture, while more accurate semi-analytical models for single vertical fractures were developed much later (Blasingame and Poe Jr., 1993). Prior to the development of models for multiply-fractured horizontal wells (Medeiros et al., 2006), it was common practice to represent these multiple fractures with an equivalent single fracture.  Several other analytical and semi-analytical models have been developed since Bello and Wattenbarger (2008); Mattar (2008); Anderson et al., (2010). Although these models are much faster than numerical simulators, they generally cannot accurately handle the very highly nonlinear aspects of shale-gas and tight-gas reservoirs because these analytical solutions address the nonlinearity in gas viscosity, compressibility and compressibility factor with the use of pseudo-pressures (an integral function of pressure, viscosity and compressibility factor) rather than solving the real-gas flow equation. Other limitations include the difficulty in accurately capturing gas desorption from the matrix, multiphase flow, multidimensional heterogeneities, unconsolidation, and several non-ideal and complex fracture networks (Houze et al., 2010).

                    "abstract": "Abstract SeTES is a self-teaching expert system that (a) can incorporate evolving databases involving any type and amount of relevant data (geological, geophysical, geomechanical, stimulation, petrophysical, reservoir, production, etc.) originating from unconventional gas reservoirs, i.e., tight sands, shale or coalbeds, (b) can continuously update its built-in 'public' database and refine the its underlying decision-making metrics and process, (c) can make recommendations about well stimulation, well location, orientation, design, and operation, (d) offers predictions of the performance of proposed wells (and quantitative estimates of the corresponding uncertainty), and (e) permits the analysis of data from installed wells for parameter estimation and continuous expansion of its database. Thus, SeTES integrates and processes any available information from multiple and diverse sources on a continuous basis to make recommendations and support decision making at multiple time-scales, while expanding its internal database and explicitly addressing uncertainty. It receives and manages data in three forms: public data, that have been made available by various contributors, semi-public data, which conceal some identifying aspects but are available to compute important statistics, and a user's private data, which can be protected and used for more targeted design and decision making. SeTES can be a vital and easy-to-use tool in gas production from unconventional gas resources, and presents a new paradigm for communicating research and technology to the public and distributing scientific tools and methods. It is expected to result in a significant improvement in reserve estimates, and increases in production by increasing efficiency and reducing uncertainty. Introduction Background. Unconventional gas resources (UGRs) are best described as gas accumulations that are hard to characterize and commercially produce by common exploration and production technologies. These resources are typically located in very tight, heterogeneous, extremely complex, and often poorly understood geologic systems, often easy to find but difficult to produce. Thus, while it is not difficult to find extensive UGRs in many basins, it is very difficult to determine their flow properties from petrophysical well surveys and to design effective completion procedures. Furthermore, because of their very low permeability, establishing gas flow at commercial rates requires costly well stimulation operations. These considerations (low permeability and complex geology) are responsible for the high risk factors and unpredictable results often associated with UGR exploration and development projects, and hamper industry investment in these resources despite their potentially vast magnitude.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Production analysis and forecast in unconventional reservoirs are challenging tasks due to high degree of uncertainty and non-uniqueness associated with well/reservoir properties. At this point the importance of diagnosis of production data to check the data consistency and to identify flow regimes has become significant. In addition, we believe that producing wells in various unconventional reservoirs exhibit unique production performance behavior due to geology, phase behavior, and completion practices. Therefore, the identification of the related performance behavior is crucial for development and forecast purposes.  The primary objective of this work is to apply diagnostic methods to investigate and understand production performance characteristics of the wells producing in unconventional reservoir systems. For our purposes, we present examples from various shale gas plays.  We propose the use of various forms of rate-time and rate-time-pressure plots for production data diagnostics. In particular, this work presents the utilization of the dimensionless ßq,cp-derivative formulation (i.e., logarithmic derivative of the rate function with respect to logarithm of time) to identify production behavior characteristics. We also propose the use of several diagnostic plots to identify performance characteristics and data consistency. In addition the use of average rate functions are presented for better resolution.  Introduction Unconventional reservoir systems can best be described as hydrocarbon accumulations which are difficult to be characterized and produced by conventional exploration and production technologies. Recently unconventional reservoir systems such as tight gas sands, shale gas, tight/shale oil, and coalbed methane reservoirs have become a significant source of hydrocarbon production and offer remarkable potential for reserves growth. Due to the low to ultra-low permeability of these reservoir systems, well stimulation operations (e.g., single or multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, etc.) are required to establish production from the formations at commercial rates.  The advances in technology to produce and develop ultra-low permeability reservoirs such as shale gas reservoirs bring the difficulties and uncertainty associated with well performance. The uncertainty is mainly due to the lack of our complete understanding of the production mechanisms and behavior of these reservoir systems. And the difficulty is therefore associated with establishing the long term production decline in these reservoirs.  In terms of production analysis in unconventional reservoirs the solutions based on the \"linear flow\" concept (Wattenbarger et al. 1998; El-Banbi and Wattenbarger 1998) are frequently used with the inclusion of effective fracture network length accounting for a single vertical fracture. Bello and Wattenbarger (2010) extend the previously mentioned linear flow solutions to account for the natural fracture network in shale gas reservoirs by proposing a linear dual porosity solution.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The analysis of production data in unconventional reservoirs to determine well/reservoir properties, completion effectiveness, and estimate future production has become popular in recent years. However, production analysis in unconventional reservoirs is a challenging task because of the non-uniqueness associated with estimating well/reservoir properties. Various analysis methodologies exist in the literature, but no single methodology is robust enough to characterize the production data and forecast production. Therefore, from a conceptual standpoint, we believe that production analysis in unconventional reservoirs should not be a \"single-method based\" application. Instead, multiple analysis techniques combined with diagnostic tools have to be utilized, and challenges associated with the analysis have to be recognized.  This work attempts to provide a review of the existing production analysis and diagnostic techniques as well as to identify the challenges associated with production analysis in unconventional reservoirs. We present an extensive evaluation of the diagnostic tools for assessing data viability, checking data correlation along with flow regime identification. Based on diagnostics and analysis results, we demonstrate the use of forward modeling (simulation) to predict future performance of single/multiple well(s) for various production/completion and field development scenarios. Field examples from a wide range of unconventional reservoirs are used to describe the application of the methodology.  Introduction Unconventional reservoir systems such as tight gas sands, shale gas, tight/shale oil, and coalbed methane reservoirs have currently become a significant source of hydrocarbon production and offer remarkable potential for reserves growth and future production. Unconventional reservoir systems can be described as hydrocarbon accumulations which are difficult to be characterized and produced by conventional exploration and production technologies. Complex geological and petrophysical systems describe unconventional reservoirs in addition to heterogeneities at all scales similar to conventional reservoir systems. Because of the low to ultra-low permeability of these reservoir systems, well stimulation operations (e.g., single or multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, etc.) are required to establish production from the formations at commercial rates.  For a long time unconventional reservoirs have been thought too complicated to produce because of the complexity and very low permeability of these reservoir systems. However, recent advances in the technology at lower costs lead the way for the exploitation of these reservoir systems. In particular, production from the unconventional reservoirs such as tight gas sands, coalbed gas, shale gas, and tight oil, has increased drastically in the recent years. According to the IEA (IEA 2009) proven reserves of unconventional gas have grown at a fast pace and now account for 4% of the worldwide total natural gas reserves. Production from unconventional gas reservoirs has become a major source of the United States natural gas supply and accounts for 47% of natural gas production (EIA 2009). Specifically, natural gas production from shale gas reservoirs is increasing rapidly and expected to account for 24% of US natural gas production in 2030 from 6% in 2008 (EIA 2010).  The advances in technology to produce and develop ultra-low permeability reservoirs such as shale gas reservoirs bring the difficulties and uncertainty associated with well performance. The uncertainty is mainly due to the lack of our fundamental understanding of the production mechanisms and behavior of these reservoirs. Currently a handful of diagnostic methods, which are based on linear/compound linear flow concepts exist to diagnose the flow behavior of this type of wells. "

This work attempts to integrate model-based production analysis (i.e., semi-analytical/analytical solutions) and rate-time analysis by using parametric correlations.  We perform production analysis and rate-time analysis for various tight gas and shale gas wells, and then correlate the various model parameters from the rate-time equations with the well/formation properties estimated using full (model-based) production data analysis. We demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology by using a sample of wells producing in tight gas and shale gas reservoirs.  We can show that the integration of production analysis and rate-time analysis via parametric correlations is highly-dependent on the size of data sample (i.e., the number of wells) and the data quality.  When high-quality data and ample production data are available, formation permeability and fracture half-length are well-correlated with the model parameters of the rate-time relations.

The common industry practice in unconventional reservoirs is to complete horizontal wells and perform multiple stage (transverse) fracture treatments.  Therefore analytical/semi-analytical modeling of horizontal wells with multiple transverse fractures is important in terms of diagnosing well performance behavior of these wells.  Soliman et al. (1990) present the production forecast of horizontal wells with multiple infinite-conductivity fractures.  van Kruysdijk and Dullaert (1989) provide an analytical solution which introduces the \"compound linear flow\" concept.  van Kruysdijk and Dullaert show that at early time dominant flow is linear, perpendicular to the fracture face until pressure transients of the individual fractures begin to interfere leading to a compound linear flow regime.  Raghavan et al. (1994) provide a mathematical description of inflow into the late-time compound linear flow regime, similar to the model proposed by van Kruysdijk and Dullaert.  Other analytical solutions to model the pressure transient behavior of horizontal wells include Guo and Evans (1993), Larsen and Hegre (1994) and Horne and Temeng (1995) solutions.  Medeiros et al.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Shale gas currently provides 20% of domestic supply, is targeted by half of the gas-directed drilling rigs, and represents the large majority of domestic resources. However, modern shale plays, their development strategies and their engineering analysis are young by comparison to those of conventional reservoirs. Uncertainty in shale gas reserves has significant implications at both the micro and macro levels.  Conventional reservoir engineering tools must be viewed as potentially inadequate (or even inappropriate) for the evaluation of shale gas performance primarily because of the extremely low aggregate permeability of these systems, but also because of other unique aspects of the systems. Reservoir modeling (simulation) has an important role as an assessment and prediction tool; however, the character of the reservoir (induced and enhanced natural fractures) must be considered, as well as the geological and fluid characteristics. Rate-transient analysis (modern decline analysis) techniques are also more rigorous and have been expanded and adapted to fit the uniqueness of shale gas production. Application of each method for shale gas is discussed, including methods and limitations. These two techniques more closely represent the physics of shale gas production, but their implementation is often prohibitive.  By way of necessity, much engineering evaluation is performed using Arps decline curve analysis. This technique is argued by some to be inappropriate due to a lack of theoretical support and demonstrated tendency to over-estimate reserves in tight gas systems. Given the limitations, practical methods exist to reduce error associated with its use. A newer decline method, power-law exponential, is also investigated.  Introduction Gas shales currently supply 20% of gas production in the United States, and the majority of gas resources in the United States. It has been the target of major capital expenses in recent years and probably represents the cause of the current gas supply glut. Expansion of gas shale plays to other parts of the world is gaining momentum.  Despite the massive capital investments made in recent years, the science of shale gas analysis and forecasting is relatively young. Horizontal wells with large, multi-stage fracture treatments became the standard protocol for gas shales in 2005, a mere six years ago, and only a few hundred wells were drilled in that year.  Though around twenty thousand horizontal shale wells have been drilled to date, the longest actual production history available is about six years. To further complicate matters, the usually frenetic and sometimes frothy nature of shale development creates an urgent need for accurate predictions of recovery very early in the life of a play.  Unfortunately, geologic and reservoir engineering principles for analysis of gas shales have lagged the science of hydraulic fracturing. In the early days of the Barnett Shale expansion, it was widely believed that regional variations in the quality of the formation was relatively minor. Production mechanisms were poorly understood, as was petrophysical analysis. It was argued, and is to certain extent still, that completion technology was the primary determinant of production and thus economic success. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in well completion technologies have transformed the unconventional reservoir systems into economically feasible reservoirs. However, the uncertainty associated with production forecasts and non-uniqueness related with well/reservoir parameter estimation, are the main issues in future development of these reservoirs. In addition, recent operational methods such as restricting rates by decreasing the choke size add up to the uncertainty in production forecasts.  This work attempts to investigate the effect of production practices on ultimate recovery. It is observed that wells producing in the Haynesville shale gas play exhibit severe productivity loss throughout their producing life. Production practices such as controlling the drawdown or restricting rates by decreasing the choke size are employed by several operators to deal with the severe productivity loss. In this work our main objective is to investigate the issues (such as stress dependent permeability, proppant embedment, operational problems, etc.) contributing to decreasing well productivity over time. In particular, from modeling standpoint, we focus on stress-dependent permeability as a mechanism, which affects well performance over time.  Using a horizontal well with multiple fractures numerical simulation model coupled with geomechanics, we generate synthetic simulation cases including several drawdown scenarios. It is shown that high drawdown cases result in higher effective stress fields around the well and fracture system. We therefore infer that higher effective stress fields result in lower well productivity over time. Based on this hypothesis and diagnostics of field data, we model two different scenarios (i.e., high drawdown and low drawdown cases) for a horizontal well with multiple fractures using two different permeability decay functions and same well/formation model parameters. Our modelling results indicate that low drawdown case yields higher recovery suggesting that rate restriction could be a mitigating factor in decreasing well productivity over time.  Introduction Hydrocarbon production from unconventional reservoir systems (e.g., tight gas sands, shale gas, tight/shale oil, etc.) has become significant in recent years due to recent advances in the technology allowing to drill and complete wells in these complex reservoir systems at lower costs. The developments in the technology to develop and produce complex unconventional reservoir systems such as shale gas reservoirs bring the difficulties and uncertainty associated with well performance. The uncertainty is mainly due to the lack of our complete understanding of the production mechanisms and behavior of these reservoir systems. And the difficulty is therefore associated with establishing the long term production decline in these reservoirs.  In simple terms this study focuses on the factors affecting well performance and productivity in the Haynesville shale. Significant amount of natural gas has been produced from the Haynesville shale since 2008 and the Haynesville shale is considered as one of the largest natural gas fields in the United States. The Haynesville shale is a black, organic rich shale of Upper Jurassic age located in east Texas and northwest Louisiana, which is deposited with mainly heavier clay minerals, silica, and calcite. The depth of the Haynesville shale ranges from approximately 10,000 ft in the northwest part to 14,000 ft in the southeast (Buller et al. 2010). It is overpressured with pressure gradients higher than 0.9 psi/ft. Due to high reservoir pressure of the Haynesville shale, production practices has been shifted to control drawdown or to restrict the rates by the operators to avoid any damage occuring in the well/reservoir during production.

                    "abstract": "Abstract The reservoir engineer involved in the development of unconventional gas reservoirs (UGRs) is required to integrate a vast amount of data from disparate sources, and to be familiar with the data collection and assessment. There has been a rapid evolution of technology used to characterize UGR reservoir and hydraulic fracture properties, and there currently are few standardized procedures to be used as guidance. Therefore, more than ever, the reservoir engineer is required to question data sources and have an intimate knowledge of evaluation procedures.  We propose a workflow for the optimization of UGR field development to guide discussion of the reservoir engineer's role in the process. Critical issues related to reservoir sample and log analysis, rate-transient and production data analysis, hydraulic and reservoir modeling and economic analysis are raised. Further, we have provided illustrations of each step of the workflow using tight gas examples. Our intent is to provide some guidance for best practices. In addition to reviewing existing methods for reservoir characterization, we introduce new methods for measuring pore size distribution (small-angle neutron scattering), evaluating core-scale heterogeneity, log-core calibration, evaluating core/log data trends to assist with scale-up of core data, and modeling flow-back of reservoir fluids immediately after well stimulation. Our focus in this manuscript is on tight and shale gas reservoirs; reservoir characterization methods for coalbed methane reservoirs have recently been discussed.  Introduction The primary functions of a reservoir engineer, according to Dake (1978) are \"estimation of hydrocarbons in place, the calculation of a recovery factor and the attachment of a time scale to the recovery\". For modern reservoir engineers, this process will include estimating fluids-in-place and forecasting fluid production for play and prospect analysis, asset valuation, resource and reserves estimation, and field development planning. For conventional reservoirs, there are \"tried and true\" methods for performing these duties that are an outcome of relatively well understood fluid storage and transport mechanisms for these reservoir types. Many techniques for quantifying key reservoir properties controlling storage and flow, calculating hydrocarbons in place, establishing recovery and forecasting production have a long history of development and refinement. The reality for unconventional gas reservoirs (UGRs), including low-permeability (tight gas), coalbed methane (CBM) and shale gas reservoirs, is that fluid storage and transport mechanisms are poorly understood, and we are at an early stage for some reservoir types (ex. shale gas) in the development of such methods. Further, it is not just necessary to characterize the reservoir in unconventional plays but also the induced hydraulic fracture(s) or fracture network, that have a large impact on well performance, yet methods for evaluating hydraulic fracture properties are also in their infancy. Indeed there are new methods for unconventional reservoir and hydraulic fracture analysis (ex. microseismic monitoring and analysis) that are considered critical to the evaluation process that have only routinely been used for oilfield applications in the past decade; it is the job of the UGR engineer to keep on top of new developments, understand the uncertainties and the consequent impact on their evaluations.

                    "abstract": "The analysis of production data to determine reservoir characteristics,completion effectiveness, and hydrocarbons in place has become very popular in recent years. Although production analysis (PA) for reservoir characterization is approaching the popularity of pressure-transient analysis (PTA), there are few consistent diagnostic methods in practice for the analysis of production data.Many of the diagnostic methods for production-data analysis are little more than observation-based approaches--and some are essentially rules of thumb. In this work, we provide guidelines for the analysis of production data, as well as identify common pitfalls and challenges. Although PTA and production-data analyses have the same governing theory (and solutions), we must recognize that pressure transient data are acquired as part of a controlled experiment, performed as a specific event [e.g., a pressure-buildup (PBU) test]. In contrast, production data are generally considered to be surveillance/monitoring data--with little control and considerable variance occurring during the acquisition of the production data. We note that since both PA and PTA have the same governing relations, it is possible \"in theory\" that the same deliverables of PTA can be obtained using PA. This paper attempts to provide a state-of-the-technology review of current production-data-analysis techniques/tools--particularly tools to diagnose the reservoir model and assess the reservoir condition. The reservoir model is diagnosed mainly by examining the character exhibited by the data [that is the evidence of transient flow (e.g., quarter-slope might indicate a finite-conductivity fracture, or half-slope might indicate radial/pseudoradial flow)]. In addition, one can also assess the reservoir condition by inspecting the character of production data, which can confirm the evidence of boundary-dominated flow such that unit slope may indicate the boundary-dominated-flow regime and, therefore, in-place fluid volume can be estimated. This work also identifies the challenges and pitfalls of PA--and we try to provide guidance toward best practices and best tools. To complement this mission, we use relevant field examples to address specific issues, and we illustrate the value and function of production-data analysis for a wide range of reservoir types and properties. In this work, we propose the use of a sequence of raw and enhanced data plots for the diagnostic analysis of production data. We strongly believe that a comprehensive and systematic approach for production-data diagnosis has significant importance for the analysis and forecast of production performance. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The estimation of reserves in unconventional reservoirs using rate-time decline relations is both challenging and often non-unique due to the very long transient flow periods exhibited by the production data. The misuse of rate-time relations during the transient flow regime can result in significant overestimation of reserves. Consequently the development of a systematic methodology which uses rate-time production data analysis and also deals with the uncertainty associated with reserve estimates should be beneficial.  This work presents the application of the recently introduced \"Continuous Estimation of Ultimate Recovery\" or \"Continuous EUR\" methodology (Currie et al. 2010) to estimate reserves in unconventional reservoirs by providing a variety of tight and shale gas examples. The \"Continuous EUR\" methodology is a procedure that employs several rate-time models to produce a profile of EUR versus production time. Upper and lower limits of ultimate recovery are established thereby reducing the uncertainty in reserves estimation prior to the onset of boundary-dominated flow.  We integrate both traditional and new rate-time relations to provide the upper limit for EUR. We show that the rate-time relations that better represent the transient flow regimes (i.e., the power law exponential rate decline relation) provide a more accurate upper limit for EUR compared to tradition rate decline relations (i.e., Arps' hyperbolic relation). We also use a straight line extrapolation technique and the power law exponential relation to produce forecasts of rate-time data that are influenced by boundary-dominated flow. The EUR estimates from these relations are used to establish a lower limit for reserves. The difference between the upper and lower limit of reserves decreases with time and converge to the \"true\" value of reserves.  The proposed methodology is applicable for all reservoir systems where production data is continuously acquired. In this work, the proposed methodology is extremely useful for estimating time-dependent reserves in unconventional reservoirs. We successfully demonstrate that the \"Continuous EUR\" methodology is a valuable tool for reducing the uncertainty in estimating reserves for unconventional gas reservoirs.  Introduction Unconventional reservoir systems have recently become a topic of increased interest because of their potential for significant hydrocarbon production and reserves potential. These reservoir systems offer unique challenges as they are difficult to characterize and produce using conventional methods due to their low permeability nature. In particular, unconventional gas reservoir (i.e., tight and shale gas reservoirs) require enhanced drilling and completion techniques (i.e., horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing) to establish production at economic rates. In addition, new approaches for reservoir characterization and production analysis have been developed to better describe reservoir behavior and predict long-term well performance. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Estimation of reserves in tight gas and shale gas reservoirs is problematic due to the low to ultra-low permeability characteristics of these reservoir systems. The sole application of conventional decline curve analysis methodologies often yields erroneous reserve estimates. Therefore, the use of theoretically-based production analysis techniques has become a must to analyze well performance and estimate reserves.  The primary objective of this work is to develop a systematic workflow, which integrates model-based production analysis and rate-time relations, for the analysis/interpretation of well performance data in unconventional reservoirs. The major steps in the proposed workflow are: ?? Diagnosis of production data. ?? Construction of a base well/reservoir model utilizing static well/reservoir data as well as completion/stimulation parameters. ?? Extrapolation of the model to predict well performance along with the use of rate-time decline relations.  The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data from unconventional reservoirs, including a horizontal well with multiple fractures. We present the application of rate-time relations to provide estimates of time-dependent reserves. The use of ßq,cp-derivative is also illustrated in distinguishing data characteristics as well as identifying issues associated with data.  Rationale for This Work Unconventional reservoir systems such as tight gas sands, shale gas, tight/shale oil, and coalbed methane reservoirs have currently become a significant source of hydrocarbon production and offer remarkable potential for reserves growth and future production. Unconventional reservoir systems can be described as hydrocarbon accumulations which are difficult to be characterized and produced by conventional exploration and production technologies. Complex geological and petrophysical systems describe unconventional reservoirs in addition to heterogeneities at all scales similar to conventional reservoir systems. Because of the low to ultra-low permeability of these reservoir systems, well stimulation operations (e.g., single or multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, etc.) are required to establish production from the formations at commercial rates.  Gas-in-place/reserves estimation in unconventional (low/ultra-low permeability) reservoirs has recently become a topic of increased interest as advanced technology permits the production and development of these resources domestically and internationally. Production data from unconventional reservoirs exhibit extensive periods of transient flow behavior due to the low/ultra-low permeability characteristics of these systems which often lead to the over-estimation of gas-in-place/reserves with the use of conventional rate-time relations (i.e., exponential and hyperbolic rate-time relations). Because of the uncertainty associated with reserves well/reservoir parameter estimation in unconventional reservoirs, a comprehensive workflow has to be developed. In this work we develop a workflow which includes using both rate-time and production data analysis methodologies (i.e., analytical/semi-analytical solutions) in conjunction to estimate well/reservoir properties and forecast production into future.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Estimating reserves in unconventional gas reservoirs is problematic due to the longer transient flow periods exhibited throughout the production history. The common industry practice is to use the Arps empirical rate-decline relations (i.e., the exponential and hyperbolic decline relations), but these equations are only strictly applicable during boundary-dominated flow. Application of the Arps relations to transient flow often results in significant overestimation of reserves. Under these circumstances, there is an obvious need for a theoretically based rate-decline equation(s) that is applicable for all flow regimes.  We developed three main rate-time relations and five supplementary rate-time relations which utilize power-law, stretched exponential, hyperbolic, and exponential components to properly model the behavior of a given set of rate-time data. The new rate-time relations are developed based on the characteristic behavior of rate-time data in unconventional reservoirs. We also present the application of the ßq,cp-derivative function for rate-time data diagnostics. Data diagnostics verify that stretched exponential function is sufficient to model rate-time behavior in unconventional reservoirs. Power-law, hyperbolic, and exponential components are incorporated into the proposed models to represent early and late time behavior. And therefore the new rate-time relations are called hybrid rate-time decline models.  We demonstrate that the new rate-time relations are well-suited for the estimation of ultimate recovery as well as for extrapolating production into the future. While our proposed models can be used for any system, we provide application almost exclusively for wells completed in unconventional reservoirs. As example applications, we present a variety of field examples using production data acquired from tight gas and shale gas reservoir systems.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Flowback data are defined as the early time-pressure-rate (TPR) data which are taken immediately following the completion and stimulation of a given well. Although typically discounted or even ignored, this data has a wealth of well/reservoir information. Analysis can provide forward-looking indications of long-term well deliverability as well as an early diagnosis of any potential production problems. Effective analysis of early TPR data, however, requires the utilization of all data sources and data types — for example: phase rates, pressures, choke settings, sand production, chlorides content, etc.    The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive workflow for early-time flowback data which provides a unique visualization of these data, as well as a correlative and integrated analysis of these data (i.e., comparing different data types and functions, correlating one data type with another, etc.). The major steps in a generic \"flowback\" workflow include:  ?? Collection and quality control of TPR and other well performance/completion data. ?? Construction/calibration of a base well/reservoir model (including well completion and stimulation parameters). ?? Construction/application of specialized plots to identify features in the data at a very basic level (i.e., water unloading). ?? Correlation of flowback data using empirical and non-parametric models. ?? Extrapolation of parametric and non-parametric models to provide predictive estimates of early-time well performance. ?? Implementation of an assessment loop to guide future production/completion practices.  The proposed methodology is demonstrated using case studies of wells completed in tight/shale gas reservoir systems. Extensive discussion is provided for the analysis/interpretation of flowback data; as well as our efforts to identify and quantify factors which affect and control production. The approach used in this work is that of a \"dashboard\" of (static) diagnostic plots as well as correlations/plots for multiple-well sets of flowback data. While the focus of this workflow is the diagnostic analysis of flowback data, we also provide guidance towards the use of flowback and long-term well performance data in \"model-based\" analyses.  Introduction The concept of \"flowback\" is quite old — historically many (if not most) wells were \"managed\" during early production as to not damage the reservoir or the wellbore tubulars. In very recent times the focus on tight gas/shale gas resources has lead to extremely large (and expensive) well stimulation treatments (often one-half of the well cost), and as such, the process of bringing a well onto production has attained something of an art form — a balance of trying to maximize initial performance, but also to begin production carefully, so as not to damage the well and/or impair long-term production.  In this paper we focus on the analysis/interpretation of the process of flowback, not the objectives or the potential ramifications of poor flowback practices. In particular, our model-based analyses may provide an assessment of damage, but we do not pursue quantification of geomechanical effects (e.g., pressure-dependent permeability or proppant embedment), nor do we propose specific flowback design procedures, although we do provide some \"holistic\" guidelines, designed to ensure that the data obtained from a flowback procedure is relevant and can be analyzed/interpreted.

                    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we analyze by means of numerical simulation the mechanisms and processes of flow in two types of fractured tight gas reservoirs: shale and tight-sand systems. The numerical model includes Darcy's law as the basic equation of multiphase flow and accurately describes the thermophysical properties of the reservoir fluids, but also incorporates other options that cover the spectrum of known physics that may be involved: non-Darcy flow, as described by a multi-phase extension of the Forschheimer equation that accounts for laminar, inertial and turbulent effects; stress-sensitive flow properties of the matrix and of the fractures, i.e., porosity, permeability, relative permeability and capillary pressure; gas slippage (Klinkenberg) effects; and, non-isothermal effects, accounting for the consequences of energy balance and temperature changes in the presence of phenomena such as Joule-Thompson cooling in the course of gas production. The flow and storage behavior of the fractured media (shale or tight sand) is represented by various options of the Multiple Interactive Continua (MINC) conceptual model, in addition to an Effective Continuum Method (ECM) option, and includes a gas sorption term that follows the Langmuir isotherm. Comparison to field data, analysis of the simulation results and parameter determination through history matching indicates that (a) the ECM model is incapable of describing the fractured system behavior, and (b) shale and tight-sand reservoirs exhibit different behavior that can be captured (albeit imperfectly) using some of the more complex options of the multi-continua fractured-system models. The sorption term is necessary to describe the behavior of shale gas reservoirs, and significant deviations from the field data are observed if it is omitted. Conversely, production data from tight-sand reservoirs can be adequately represented without accounting for gas sorption. All the other processes and mechanisms allow refinement of the match between predictions and observations, but appear to have secondorder effects in the description of flow through fractured tight gas reservoirs.  Introduction Background. Tight sand and shale gas reservoirs have recently emerged as a potentially huge resource, and production from such reservoirs has seen an explosive growth over the last few years. Ultratight reservoirs present numerous challenges to modeling and understanding. These reservoirs typically require fracture stimulation, which create complex flow profiles.  Additionally, according to Hill and Nelson (2000), between 20 and 85 percent of total storage in shales may be in the form of adsorbed gas. Production from desorption follows a nonlinear response to pressure and results in unintuitive and difficult-tomodel pressure profile behavior. Closed or open natural fracture networks in ultratight reservoirs introduce further complexity through interaction with the induced fractures.  The explosion in production has not been accompanied with the same level of understanding of the basic principles that govern flow in these ultratight reservoirs. The existence of fractures (natural and induced), the matrix-fracture interference, and the challenges posed by the lack of fundamental knowledge on the release of gases from sorption in nearly-impermeable formations with pores on the same order of magnitude as the mean free path of the gases make this a formidable problem that strains current simulation capabilities. In this study we attempt to investigate whether, with the knowledge gained thus fur (albeit limited), and with an understanding of the main mechanisms and processes involved in mass and heat transfer in these ultratight formation, we may be possible to predict their behavior using simplified geological, geometric and property models.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Oil and gas reserves estimates which honor disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are critically important in the international oil and gas industry. Unfortunately, a number of E&P companies have allegedly overstated and subsequently written down certain reserves volumes in recent years. In some cases, the consequences have been quite adverse. We document some of these cases of reserves overstatements and summarize the consequences. Reserves write-downs are of obvious interest to numerous groups involved in the reserves estimation process and outcome, including estimators, managers, investors, creditors, and regulators. The magnitude and nature of recent overstatement cases, relative unfamiliarity with the SEC's inner-workings, and the Commission's new reserves reporting requirements, increase the need to examine critically reserves disclosures and reserves overstatements.  Disclaimer This paper discusses write-downs and alleged overstatements of oil and gas reserves. Information used to write this report has been obtained from extensive examination of the public record. Overstatements and violations of federal securities laws and actions by a company or its representatives are only alleged in the public record and, unless stated otherwise, any settlements discussed should be considered as made without admission of guilt. Write-downs can readily happen with even the best of intentions. We authors—and you readers—are not judge and jury. Our intent is to raise awareness about write-downs, overstatements, and observed consequences, and to promote the responsible reporting of oil and gas reserves.  Overview of the Reserves Overbooking Issue A number of E&P companies have, in recent years, allegedly overstated and subsequently written down certain reserves volumes reported to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Operators including Shell, El Paso, Stone Energy, and Repsol YPF, among others, have found themselves in the spotlight—and courtroom—for alleged overstatements of their oil and gas reserves. Overstatements and write-downs have occurred for a variety of reasons, and have often been accompanied by significant adverse consequences. A stigma and discomfort surrounding overstatements exists within industry, as the topic has been labeled \"the problem no one wants to talk about?? (McLane 2001).  The SEC has roles, investigative processes, and enforcement procedures unlike any other organization involved with the oil and gas industry. However, the Commission's inner workings are not frequently discussed or well-understood by all of the groups these rules affect. The SEC's Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements has made certain standards more flexible (e.g., elimination of the \"one offset rule?? and allowance of \"reliable technologies??). Accordingly, engineers must now adjust to these new guidelines and deal with the possibility of disclosing previously unrecognized asset value without overstating reserves. The difficulty of this task, along with the technical \"liberalization?? and an enhanced \"principles-based?? emphasis in the rules, could create even greater potential for reserves overstatements than in the past.  Therefore, the magnitude and nature of recent alleged overstatement cases, relative unfamiliarity with the SEC's innerworkings, and the Commission's new reporting requirements have created a need to discuss openly reserves disclosures and reserves overstatements. Overstatements are not confined to particular reserves categories, asset types or locations, or filer size. However, overstatements are most likely to occur within the Proved Undeveloped (PUD) category. Reserves write-downs can create nearly instantaneous value destruction for shareholders. A study of case histories indicates that significant corporate and/or individual penalties may be associated with overstatements, along with the potential for class action lawsuits. "

                    "abstract": "With increasing demand for natural gas, higher product prices and the availability of improved extraction technologies, there is increasing focus on infill drilling in tight gas reservoirs.  However, quantification of incremental recovery (one of the key value generators) is often challenging particularly in commingled multi-layered heterogeneous fluvial reservoirs with a paucity of data collection.  The issues related to the volume and quality of data collected are magnified when low cost infill development is undertaken.  This paper demonstrates a new technique using production data (in isolation) to estimate incremental and accelerated recovery for such a development. For infill development, various methods have been proposed to quantify incremental recovery.  The most common range from simple reservoir continuity models, Arps Decline Curves, Material Balance, field analogue studies, to complex reservoir simulation.  This paper discusses a new methodology termed 'Progressive Multi-well Blasingame Analysis' based on Blasingame type curves which successively compares boundary-dominated responses from each infill phase to distinguish incremental from accelerated recovery achieved from each phase of infill development. The paper reviews the theoretical support for the Progressive Multi-well Blasingame Analysis method via a numerical simulation study.  Demonstration of this methodology is performed using a field case study to quantify incremental recovery and identify additional infill opportunities in an environment where limited reservoir surveillance was conducted.  The paper concludes by discussing the applicability and the pros and cons of this technique. In essence, this paper addresses an existing knowledge gap in industry as it provides a method to efficiently evaluate a group of wells and distinguish incremental from accelerated recovery using only the production rate and flowing tubing head pressure data. Introduction The world's energy needs are growing with gas widely accepted as the most likely transition fuel.  Energy Outlook 2009 (published by the U.S. Department of Energy) quotes tight gas as the largest source of unconventional gas production, accounting for thirty percent of the total U.S. production by 2030.  Given that few new fields are being identified, the focus will turn towards improved extraction from existing fields via infill drilling.  Cost effective exploitation of these resources requires an understanding of the incremental and accelerated recovery likely to be realized by future infill drilling since it is often the former that is the critical value generator. For the purposes of this paper, incremental recovery is defined as the additional quantity of gas accessed by a new well that would not otherwise be technically recoverable from existing wells.  This can be achieved by intersecting new sands or improved completion efficiency.  In contrast, accelerated recovery is the quantity of gas from common sands that would have been produced from existing wells but is produced sooner (i.e., accelerated) as a result of new well(s).

                    "abstract": "Gas in place/reserves estimation in unconventional (low/ultra-low permeability) reservoirs has become a topic of increased interest as more of these resources are being developed domestically and internationally. Production data from these unconventional gas reservoirs exhibit extended periods of transient/transition flow behavior that often lead to the over-estimation of gas in place/reserves with the use of simple rate-time extrapolation techniques. In this work we show that the analysis of production data (particularly rate-time data) before the onset of boundary dominated flow for these unconventional gas reservoirs leads to significant overestimation of gas in place/reserves. Consequently, we introduce the concept of \"continuous estimation of ultimate recovery\" (or Continuous EUR) where estimation of reserves from a single gas well is performed in a dynamic fashion — in other words we continuously estimate the reserves for selected time intervals throughout the producing life of the well. We have applied the Continuous EUR method by using simple rate-time relations such as the Arps' \"hyperbolic\" rate decline relation and the power-law exponential rate decline relation. We present the application of the Continuous EUR method with a tight gas data set and four (tight gas) field data sets. Our analyses show that the distinction in the flow behavior is more evident and the uncertainty in reserves estimation decreases significantly when reserves are evaluated continuously. Introduction The estimation of reserves in unconventional reservoir systems is problematic due to the extremely complex geology, and because of the very low permeability of the reservoirs, longer transient flow periods are being exhibited throughout the producing life of the well. Under these circumstances the uncertainty in reserves estimation is high and usually the reserves are over-estimated. From a practical standpoint, simple rate-time relations are used in order to estimate reserves in unconventional reservoir systems. These relations (i.e., Arps' rate-time relations) are very simple to use, but they usually over-predict the reserves as they are only applicable for the boundary-dominated flow regime whereas unconventional reservoirs exhibit very long transient flow periods (years or even decades). In this work we propose the use of the simple rate-time relations in a dynamic (continuous) manner to reduce the uncertainty in reserve estimates. We specify a time interval amongst the production sequence, and for each interval we perform extrapolation to obtain the maximum production (i.e., the estimation of ultimate recovery). For example, for 500 days of production data (i.e., rate-time data) we may select a 100-day time interval and the maximum production would be estimated using 100 days, 200 days, 300 days, 400 days, and 500 days of production data (in principle, the interval is arbitrary — it could even be daily, but such a small interval would require an automated procedure, which is not addressed in this paper). We choose to call this procedure as the continuous estimation of reserves or Continuous EUR approach. For our purposes we use the Arps' hyperbolic rate-time and the power-law exponential rate-time relations for the continuous estimation of reserves. Hyperbolic Rate Decline Function: The most common method of well performance (i.e. rate-time data) analysis involves the empirical rate-time relations presented by Arps [1945]. These equations were developed to analyze data exhibiting boundary-dominated flow behavior. Arps' equations are widely used to forecast production behavior and estimate reserves. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Various analytical, semi-analytical, and empirical models have been proposed to characterize rate/pressure behavior as a function of time in tight/shale gas systems featuring wells of various completion designs. Despite a few analytical models as well as a small number of published numerical studies there is currently little consensus regarding the importance of the various transport and storage mechanisms on performance over time and whether or not reservoir properties/volume can be estimated from well performance data.  We constructed a fit-for-purpose numerical simulator which accounts for a variety of production features pertinent to these systems, specifically: hydraulically fractured horizontal wells possessing induced fractures with Forchheimer flow, stress dependent properties, multicomponent diffusive and Knudsen flow and desorption, and the presence of water, which introduces issues of relative permeability and wettability, as well as gas solution and phase change. These features cover several of the production and storage mechanisms which are currently believed to be relevant in tight/shale gas systems.  We employ the numerical simulator to examine various tight/shale gas systems and to study the effects of reservoir and completion parameters on performance. We employ rate and auxiliary functions to illustrate the impact of water, desorption, thermal, and non-Darcy flow effects on performance. The relationship between these factors and the change in produced gas composition with time is explored.  We explore variations of possible shale gas system models. Based on non-Darcy flow in the microscale and inertial regimes (with/without desorption), we show that due to the extremely low permeability of shale and various intrinsic permeability reducing effects, the flow behavior is dominated by the fracture system configuration and extent.  This work expands our understanding of transport and storage mechanisms in tight gas and shale gas systems and their impact on performance, where such an understanding may ultimately be used to estimate reservoir properties and reserves in these types of reservoirs.

                    "abstract": "A feasibility study is being undertaken at Texas A&M University investigating the concept of using existing wellbores, formerly used for oil and gas production, to provide geothermal space conditioning for the 2000 acre Texas A&M RELLIS Campus. The RELLIS campus is currently constructing its first building and is expected to ultimately include approximately 2,000,000 ft2 of education, research and office space. Several horizontal wellbores, originally used for hydrocarbon production, extending beneath the RELLIS campus are no longer economic and would otherwise be plugged and abandoned if an alternative use were not found. A conversion of such abandoned wellbores for multi-use geothermal energy supply (in a cascaded array of heating, cooling and electrical power generation) could substantially extend the reach of technically recoverable geothermal resources by paving the way for the implementation of a unique large-scale geothermal energy recovery project. This would be one of the first projects in the world to repurpose existing oil and gas wells for large-scale geothermal use. Much work remains to be done, but this progress report outlines the achievements of the initial assessment completed after the first year of the project study. Beyond providing clean energy, the RELLIS Campus geothermal initiative will help find solutions to the issues surrounding non-economic and abandoned oil and gas wellbores, which impact both oil and gas companies and the taxpayers.

Subsequently, the use of the benchmarked model is demonstrated in a review of the flow patterns in the Quitman field, a tabular reservoir comprising an 18 ft thick payzone of Harris sand interfingering with shales of the Eagle Ford formation. The reservoir is bound by impervious faults modelled by the method of images in earlier studies of the 1970's. In the present study, Riemann's mapping theorem in combination with the Schottky-Klein prime function is applied to find complex potentials that describe the flow in the bounded reservoir. Such an approach can model waterflooding in marginal fields like the Quitman oil field more accurately than previous potential flow methods and can visualize the sweep pattern and compute time-of-flight contours in a simpler and faster fashion than numerical streamline simulators.

Decline curve analysis, applied to production data from four multi-fracked wells in the Eagle Ford formation (Brazos County, East Texas), provides forecasts for the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). About 50% of EUR is realized in the first 1000 days (∼3 years) of the well-life. The drainage model shows where in the reservoir the produced fluid is actually drained from, based on the estimated reservoir parameters. This study includes several fundamental assessments of factors that may impact any drainage model, such as (1) the pressure front propagation time responsible for the depth of investigation, (2) pressure effects due to up-scaling of fracture patterns into a reduced number of fractures, and (3) interaction of fluid velocity patterns with pressure depletion zones. The drainage model for the Eagle Ford wells in our case study suggests that the first generation of hydraulic fractures recovers less than 1% of the original oil in place. With recovery factors so low, a repetitive schedule of periodic refracking the wells - provided the first refracks prove successful - is highly recommended. "

A new analytical expression is derived to model the flow through natural fractures with enhanced hydraulic conductivity. Synthetic examples show that in an otherwise homogeneous reservoir even a small number of natural fractures may severely affect streamline patterns and distort the drainage contours. Multiple parallel natural fractures result in a drainage region that is narrower in the direction normal to the natural fractures while the drainage reach is larger in the natural fracture direction. Reservoirs with numerous natural fractures are shown to be characterized by more tortuous drainage patterns than reservoirs without natural fractures. Finally, the analytical flow model for naturally fractured reservoirs is applied to a natural analog of flow into hydraulic fractures. The tendency of the injected fluid to stay confined to the fracture network as opposed to matrix flow is entirely controlled by the hydraulic conductivity contrast between the fracture network and the matrix.

                    "abstract": "Various decline curve analysis (DCA) methods can be applied to forecast the production performance of hydrocarbon wells, including horizontal wells stimulated with hydraulic fracturing. Yet, which method is more preferable remains in doubt. The objective of this study is to evaluate various DCA methods by history matching and hindcasting both synthetic and field production data in order to assess for each method the reliability of production forecasts and the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). Five DCA methods have been evaluated because of their computational simplicity and broad application. These methods are the Modified Hyperbolic Decline model (MHD), Duong model, Logistic Growth Analysis Model (LGM), and the Power Law Exponential (PLE, with D∞=0 and D∞=∞) Decline models. Each method was evaluated using three data sets: synthetic shale oil production rates based on a CMG reservoir model using Eagle Ford reservoir characteristics, data from producing Eagle Ford wells and from Austin Chalk wells. The hindcast method was applied to the Eagle Ford synthetic wells to establish the EUR deviation between the synthetic reservoir model production forecast and the various DCA methods. The weighted residuals of history matched production rates for Eagle Ford indicate that the MHD and Duong models give the lowest matching errors (as low as 1.32%) and the highest EUR estimations (as high as 3,447,609 stb). The PLE model (with D∞≠0) gives the most conservative EUR estimation, and also the least reliable history matching method (on our Eagle Ford data sets), which therefore is the least preferable DCA method. For the Austin Chalk wells in our study, all methods generate fairly similar EUR predictions with similar matching errors (from 13% to 15%) so that the DCA method preference becomes indifferent. This study also touches upon the relationship between DCA results when well interference occurs due to various hydraulic fracture hits. Shale wells that primarily contain hydraulic fractures and few natural fractures (Eagle Ford) give the most reliable forecasts using the MHD and Duong DCA methods. However, wells in the Austin Chalk, a naturally fractured reservoir, show little difference between the forecast accuracy from the various DCA methods. "

From 1986 onward daily market prices allow more detailed analyses of the principal crude oil benchmarks (West Texas Intermediate [WTI] and Brent). The mean reversion price for a given time period corresponds to the marginal cost of supply. When supply and demand are out of equilibrium, spot prices move in a bandwidth bound at the bottom by cash cost of supply and at the top by the concurrent price of demand destruction. Short-term elasticity of demand is 0.015 (highly inelastic), and long-term elasticity of supply changed from 0.99 (highly elastic) during 1965–1983 to 0.39 (less elastic) during 1984–2012. We derive functions for the long-term equilibrium price and expand them into scalable equilibrium price functions for forecasting future price scenarios if “business-as-usual” is assumed. We also consider how two hypothetical black swan events (“unknown unknowns”) may affect the mean equilibrium price. "

A greater understanding of the principal stress trajectories and related stress magnitudes around stressed cylindrical holes in rock formations significantly aids the design of safer and more stable wellbores, advances our capacities in hydraulic fracturing, and provides additional insights into the nature and stability of volcanic dikes, salt domes, and caverns used for hydrocarbon and other fluid storage. The algorithms used in our study systematically non-dimensionalize the analytical Kirsch equations using two critical parameters to scale the variable boundary conditions: (1) the Bi-axial Stress Scalar, χ, describes the far-field stresses at all depths and for each of the formations penetrated by a cylindrical borehole or natural liquid-filled pipe by describing the anisotropy of the two far-field principal stresses, and (2) the Frac Number, F, specifies the net pressure on the cylindrical hole as it relates to the natural background stress in the host rock and the pressure in the penetrated formation at each depth. Manipulation of these two governing parameters (χ, F) enables us to view and monitor the stress trajectories in the host rock around a cylindrical hole at any given depth. Additionally, the neutral point locations and their effects on the principal stress orientations near the cylindrical hole have been more thoroughly investigated than in earlier studies. The neutral points form the boundaries for the “stress cage” in overbalanced cylindrical cavities and for the complimentary “fracture cage” in underbalanced cavities. The understanding of stresses induced around cylindrical holes in a rock formation is paramount in geotechnical analyses and stability appraisals of manmade cylindrical holes as well as for the geoscientific interpretation of piercing by cylindrical, fluid-filled pipes. Our stress atlas aims to provide fundamental insight and practical support for such analyses. "

                    "abstract": "The effect of well interference through fracture hits in shale reservoirs needs to be investigated because hydraulic fracturing is abundantly used in the development of unconventional oil and gas resources. Although numerous pressure tests have proved the existence of well interference, relatively few physical models exist to quantitatively simulate the pressure response of well interference. The objective of the present study is to develop a numerical compositional model in combination with a fast embedded-discrete-fracture-model (EDFM) method to simulate well interference. Through nonneighboring connections (NNCs), the fast EDFM method can easily and properly handle complex-fracture geometries, such as nonplanar hydraulic fractures and a large amount of natural fractures. Using public data for Eagle Ford tight oil, we build a reservoir model including up to three horizontal wells and five fluid pseudocomponents. The simulation results show that the connecting hydraulic fractures play a more-important role than natural fractures in declining bottomhole pressure (BHP) of the shut-in well. Matrix permeability has a relatively minor effect on pressure drawdown, and well productivity remains only slightly affected by the overall low permeability used. The BHP pressure-decline profiles change from convex to concave when the conductivity of the connecting fractures increases. At early times, the BHP of the shut-in well decreases when the number of natural fractures increases. At later times, the natural-fracture density has a lesser effect on the pressure response and no clear trend. The opening order of neighboring wells affects the well-interference intensity between the target shut-in well and the surrounding wells. After a systematic investigation of pressure drawdown in the reservoir, we formulate practical conclusions for improved production performance. "

Flow patterns in the NHS geothermal reservoir are visualized using a novel streamline simulation tool applying known well rates and benchmarking the residence time of re-injected brine based on tracer tests performed by the company.

The contracts for deepwater assets in Mexico open up commercially viable options, provided the oil price will recover to render such oil projects profitable. Our sensitivity analysis shows that profitable development of 300 MMbbls oil in place becomes possible when oil prices rise above $75/bbl. For larger reservoirs (~900 MMbbls) the profit hurdle rate of 15% is already met for $60/bbl.

Decline curve analysis and discounted cash flow analysis are applied to evaluate and re-appraise both the productivity and economic performance (internal rate of return, IRR) of typical Bakken wells in each region. For wells of similar estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), the fiscal regime of Montana (IRR 27%) is slightly more advantageous than North Dakota's (IRR 24%). If wells can be identified in SK akin to ND's reference well of 555 Mbbls EUR, the Canadian province provides the most attractive after tax return (180%). However, type curves for Bakken wells in SK and MT analyzed in our study typically have EURs at only 14% and 37% of the ND reference well (EUR∼555 Mbbls) and IRRs adjusted for EUR in MT and SK are negative in both regions at the historic reference price of $80/bbl. A sensitivity analysis using oil prices ranging between $20–100/bbl accounts for any of the price levels seen in the 2014–2016 price fall, and can be projected forward. The evaluation of single well economics and sensitivity to oil price changes and drilling and completion cost is subsequently expanded with a representative firm approach considering certain asset development options with multiple wells in each of the three Bakken jurisdictions (ND, MT, SK).

Yet, Mexico's estimated resource of technically recoverable shale gas (545 Tcf) is the 6th largest such gas resource in the World. Much of Mexico's shale gas resource is in the Eagle Ford Shale, which is a mature shale gas and oil play in the U.S. To aid in determination of whether development of the Eagle Ford Shale in Mexico could reduce the country's dependency on natural gas imports, we evaluated the potential of Mexican shale acreage by comparing the after-tax net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) of Eagle Ford shale wells on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border. The initial development of Mexican acreage occurs with a much larger well-spacing (leading to higher acreage acquisition cost per well), which would require 25% higher development cost as compared to Texas acreage. Consequentially, Texas wells have better net present value (NPV) and higher internal rate of return (IRR) than Mexican wells, in general. The principal explanation is that the signing bonus will be much higher in Mexico than in Texas, partly effectuated by the lower well spacing for unrisked acreage. Results of our study provide potential operators and investors with a preliminary indication of Eagle Ford Shale well economics in Mexico. Our study includes sensitivity analyses for both non-escalated and escalated gas prices, for drilling and completion (D&C) costs, and for leasehold cost.

Near-wellbore stress trajectory maps are produced using non-dimensional solutions of the stress function for balanced, overbalanced and underbalanced borehole sections. Particular attention is paid to the isotropic points, where no deviatoric stress occurs, as these mark the locations where principal stress reversals occur, an aspect that has not been highlighted before. When wellbores are overbalanced, stress cages develop, and the region occupied by a stress cage grows when the net pressure (positive) on the wellbore is much larger than the far-field principal stress. Fracture cages are a complementary phenomenon occurring in underbalanced wellbores. Fracture cages occupy larger areas when the absolute value of the (negative) net pressure grows larger relative to the far-field (native) stress state. A novel nomogram visualizes the continuous range of stress trajectories around overbalanced as well as underbalanced borehole sections, and is scalable by a single dimensionless number, 1/ζ, coined the Frac number. A proper understanding of the principal stress trajectories is extremely useful for predicting the planes of least resistance for fracture initiation. The Frac number can thus contribute to the optimization of well design and hydraulic fracture placement. "

                    "abstract": "Development of Mexican hydrocarbon reservoirs by foreign operators has become possible under Mexico's new Hydrocarbon Law, effective as per January 2015. Our study compares the economic returns of shallow water fields in the Gulf of Mexico applying the royalty and taxes due under the fiscal regimes of the U.S. and Mexico. The net present value (NPV) of the base case scenario is US$1.4 billion, assuming standard development and production cost (opex, capex), 10% discount rate accounting for the cost of capital and revenues computed using a reference oil price of $75/bbl. The impact on NPV of oil price volatility is accounted for in a sensitivity analysis. The split of the NPV of shallow water hydrocarbon assets between the two contractual parties, contractor and government, in Mexico and the U.S. is hugely different. Our base case shows that for similar field assets, Mexico's production sharing agreement allocates about $1,150 million to the government and $191 million to the contractor, while under U.S. license conditions the government take is about $700 million and contractor take is $553 million. The current production sharing agreement leaves some marginal shallow water fields in Mexico undeveloped for reasons detailed and quantified in our study. "

The Parallel Analytical Streamline Simulator (PASS), based on AEM, enables fast time-of-flight (TOF) calculations and visualizations of sweep efficiency in homogeneous, heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs. Simulations with PASS can test the sweep efficiency for a wide range of well patterns even before field development. We assume a simple direct-line drive and various initial reservoir attributes: a homogenous base case and further explore the effects on the flood advance of zones with heterogeneous permeability and an impervious fault. For all cases, analytical streamline patterns and time-of-flight contours for the flood front (obtained with PASS) are compared to those generated via an independent method based on numerical discretization by a commercial reservoir simulator. The results are convergent and confirm that PASS can be used to determine in closed-loop simulations the well rates that will avoid the occurrence of premature water breakthrough in the production wells. Early breakthrough in the homogenous reservoir occurs for the central producers and occurs later for the peripheral producers. Real-time adjustments of the water injection rates based on closed-loop surveillance of the pressures in producer wells can redirect and control the reservoir flow such that the floodfront arrives simultaneously at all producers. For the heterogeneous reservoir, smart-field well-control for improved sweep efficiency is also visualized. However, when an impervious fault zone blocks the flow path between injector and producer wells the occurrence of premature arrival of injection water in some producers cannot be avoided. "

Rapid technology innovation can help companies to improve the economic performance of shale gas fields. Cash flow models are paramount for setting effective production and technology innovation targets to achieve positive returns on investment in all global shale gas plays. Future cash flow of a well (or cluster of wells) may either improve further or deteriorate, depending on: (1) the regional volatility in gas prices at the wellhead – which must pay for the gas resource extraction, and (2) the cost and effectiveness of the well technology used. Gas price is an externality and cannot be controlled by individual companies, but well technology cost can be reduced while improving production output. We assume two plausible scenarios for well technology innovation and model the return on investment while checking against sensitivity to gas price volatility. It appears well technology innovation – if paced fast enough – can fully redeem the negative impact of gas price decline on shale well profits, and the required rates are quantified in our sensitivity analysis.

Algorithms based on complex potentials can trace multiple source flows as they compete for space when spreading into a 2D fluid continuum (a canopy). The method can visualize detailed flow patterns of coalescing source fluids, and may improve our understanding of how salt sheets coalesce to form an expanding canopy. Any new insight of canopy formation is extremely valuable, because such canopies – like the Sigsbee salt canopy in the Walker Ridge region – are the scene of major hydrocarbon drilling projects. The suture zones between the colliding salt sheets are potential drilling hazards due to anomalous pressure behavior of entrapped sediments. A case study of the Walker Ridge region applies the analytical method to reconstruct the coalescence of the salt sheets issued from at least 22 feeder stocks. Using as inputs the location of the feeder stocks, ramps and flats reflected in the base of salt map, the analytical method can constrain the flow parameters (source strengths, timing of feeder onset) for each feeder stock. The model can be used to render synthetic allosuture maps, which are valuable for practical application in the pre-drilling planning of well trajectories that should avoid drilling into sutures zones.

Vertical cross-sections and base-of-salt maps, both rendered from seismic images, have previously revealed the existence of suture zones inside major salt sheets. A better understanding of the sutures is required to safely drill hydrocarbon reservoirs located below such salt bodies. The suture zones are potential drilling hazards due to anomalous pressure behavior of entrapped sediments. A large range of suture shapes and overriding structures are seen in seismic sections of salt canopies; an even larger range of suture shapes is modeled here by systematically varying the key parameters responsible for their formation. A better understanding of the structural evolution of sutures improves their early detection and reduces the risk of drilling hazards. "

                    "abstract": "This article analyzes the change over the past 25 years in selected financial and operational performance indicators of US and EU based peer groups of oil Majors. After the Millennium's turn, all peer group companies experienced steep rises in their unit cost of production. Until 2000, oil Majors could replace reserves depleted by production, typically by splitting capital employed equally between upstream and downstream activities. Upstream assets include progressively more deepwater fields and unconventional resources, resulting in increased reserve replacement costs. This means the share of capital employed on upstream projects has risen to 70% in 2013. Capital expenditure (Capex) in the upstream segment for oil Majors is nearly 80% of the total, and for downstream (and other activities) Capex has been reduced accordingly (partly by asset divestures). In spite of sharply increased Capex on upstream projects, production output of the peer group has declined 6% since 2006. The profitability of upstream projects peaked in 2008, then declined and subsequently steadied at returns on capital employed (ROCEs) of about 20% in the period 2010–2012. US Majors have returned a greater proportion of cash generated from operations to shareholders than their EU counterparts, consistently so over the past 6 years. US companies achieved this better outcome in part by rapidly decreasing capital employed in downstream assets when these became less profitable. Downstream ROCEs have been weak over the past decade, but a modest recovery has begun. Downstream ROCEs of 15% in 2012 are sharply up from a low of 5% in 2009. For the coming decade, we expect fierce competition for technology leadership. To meet rising demand, oil and gas companies must increasingly produce from very complex fields, development cost of which will inevitably require high oil and gas prices. The rising cost of hydrocarbon extraction creates a strong incentive to accelerate the energy transition away from costly hydrocarbons toward progressively more affordable renewable energy resources.

The future spread in gas output in our models follows from variations in the number of wells that will be drilled according to three distinct scenarios. Each scenario assumes a well development plan for the six major shale plays over the studied period and then quantifies the cumulative US production output from the combined shale plays. We compare the bottom-up model results with other model projections for future US shale gas output, including the top-down shale gas production forecasts by the US National Energy Modeling System (NEMS). The remarkable growth of North American gas output from unconventional resources has been highlighted in numerous industry reports and government publications, but what has remained relatively underexposed is the deterioration of economic margins due to the failure to predict the gas price decline in the North American market. The past development record of North America’s shale gas resources suggests that security of future gas supplies seems ensured, but here we develop a contrarian view. Our scenario models take into account the effect of recent declines in gas rig counts and decline in gas well completions due to the depressed gas prices. A scenario with declining shale gas output – one of three scenarios considered – cannot be excluded as being unlikely to occur, which means the future security of US gas supply that assumes a steady growth of shale gas supply cannot be ascertained at present.

Each play is assessed using a uniform field development plan with 100 wells drilled at a rate of 10 wells/year in the first decade. The gas production from the realized wells is monitored over a 25 year life cycle. Discounted cash flow models are used to establish for each shale field the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) that must be realized, using current technology cost, to achieve a profit. Our analyses of internal rates of return (IRR) and net present values (NPVs) indicate that the Polish and Austrian shale plays are the more robust, and appear profitable when the strict P90 assessment criterion is applied. In contrast, the Posidonia (Germany), Alum (Sweden) and a Turkish shale play assessed all have negative discounted cumulative cash flows for P90 wells, which puts these plays below the hurdle rate. The IRR for P90 wells is about 5% for all three plays, which suggests that a 10% improvement of the IRR by sweet spot targeting may lift these shale plays above the hurdle rate. Well productivity estimates will become better constrained over time as geological uncertainty is reduced and as technology improves during the progressive development of the shale gas fields. "

Volatility in natural-gas prices may lead to downgrading of formerly proved reserves when the marginal cost of production cannot be sustained by the wellhead prices realized. New US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules have accelerated the growth of unconventional-gas reserves, which in a way is an additional but unintended source of volatility and hence risk. Concerns about security of investments in unconventional-gas assets are driven by the effects of volatile natural-gas prices on production economics and by uncertainty about stability of reported reserves. This concern is exacerbated by an unprecedented rise in proved undeveloped gas reserves (PUDs) reported by unconventional-gas operators, arguably effectuated by favorable interpretations of PUDs when applying the new SEC accounting rules. This study includes a benchmark of proved reserves reported by two peer groups, each comprising four representative companies. The peer group of conventional companies includes Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP, and the unconventional peer group is made up of Chesapeake, Petrohawk, Devon, and EOG. Possible sources of undue uncertainty in reported reserves are highlighted, and recommendations are given to improve the reliability of reported reserves, especially from unconventional field assets.

A case is made here for adjusting regulatory policy, as past and current policies have led to a steady profit decline for mid- and downstream US energy companies. Capital markets have rated several major energy companies as ‘junk bonds’, which means default risk is substantial from an investor perspective. Arguably, overly tight price regulation and declining credit ratings have pushed the industry into a decade-long downward business cycle, which started even before the Great Recession provided additional challenges. Recommendations are formulated for improving the US energy regulation of the mid and downstream natural gas segments in order to revitalize these key pillars of the energy transition program. Insights developed here based on the regulatory development and business performance of energy utilities in the US may provide a useful reference for liberalized and liberalizing energy markets elsewhere in the world.

Improving the transparency of our vision sharing and strategy making processes in a systematic way is therefore as important as the actual systems engineering solutions proposed by the modeling tools. Energy trend forecasting and back-casting, scenarios and system analysis have matured into powerful modeling tools for providing advice on optimizing our future energy solutions. The integrated use and iterative improvement of all these approaches can result in energy systems that become better optimized.

                    "abstract": "Abstract A new approach, using stress functions, reveals how each component of the stress regime affects the stress pattern around the wellbore. The effect of tectonic far field stress on the stress trajectories in the host rock near a wellbore is visualized in a series of plots with the analytical stress trajectory solutions for a large range of net pressures on the wellbore. The deviatoric stresses around a wellbore result from the dynamic superposition of (1) far field tectonic stress, (2) near wellbore stress due to lithostatic pressure near the open hole, (3) pore over-pressure or under-pressure in the host rock, and (4) hydraulic pressure applied on the wellbore. The principal stress trajectory plots are used to determine the suitable options for well orientations and to delineate stress trajectory control of the incipient brittle failure patterns for hydrofracs and wellbore breakouts. Our approach provides fundamental insight, with an important practical application for improved understanding of the growth of hydrofractures.  Introduction Drilling operations must be executed safer and cleaner to assure the concerned public that due diligence is exercised by oil and gas operators with a sustained effort to improve the drilling practice learning curve. In fact, drilling operations around the globe have been riskier than even the experts realized. A new analytical stress function description revealed that wellbores may unintentionally enlarge by concentric tension fractures in over-pressured rocks. Drilling engineers have long known that underpressured drill holes tend to collapse due to the pressure of the wall rock, which increases with depth. The pressure on the inside of the wellbore must be kept high enough to prevent the wellbore from collapsing inward (cf., Weijermars, 1998), which is why heavy bentonite mud is circulated down drill holes (cf., Achmed & Meehan, 2012). Fracture caging is a recently recognized drilling hazard that directs induced fractures to curl around the wellbore (Fig 1).  Fracture caging leads to cavitation/slabbing/spalling under specific physical conditions. The phenomenon has been described analytically (Weijermars, 2011) and examples appeared in numerical fully coupled fluid flow simulations (Zhang et al, 2011). The puzzling curling of hydro-fractures was presented independently by the two research teams (TUDelft, Netherlands and CSIRO, Australia) at the 45th US Rock Mechanics Symposium (ARMA) held in San Francisco, June 2011. One of the CSIRO numerical model runs (Zhang et al., 2011) confirmed that the circumferential tension fractures (Fig. 1) grow exactly as predicted by the analytical stress function theory (Weijermars, 2011) - the analytical and numerical results matched perfectly (Fig. 1).

The simplicity of the dilemma matrix articulated here may help to focus the debate at future Global Summits and World Future Energy Summits on the critical scenario options. Geoscientists and engineers at energy companies share a major responsibility with many societal actors in setting the right example, particularly in searching for sustainable energy solutions. One view is that technology can help solve all issues. Another view is that nature is needed for sustainable ecosystem services. A most pessimistic view is based on analogy of human behavior with that of ants – eusocial groups like ourselves. Ant wars for access to limited resources warn us for a future where scarcity of resources may force us to resort to brutal, competitive behavior – rather than civilized diplomacy. Options to avoid such an outcome are outlined in this study. "

                    "abstract": "The total annual revenue stream in the US natural gas value chain over the past decade is analyzed. Growth of total revenues has been driven by higher wellhead prices, which peaked in 2008. The emergence of the unconventional gas business was made possible in part by the pre-recessional rise in global energy prices. The general rise in natural gas prices between 1998 and 2008 did not lower overall US gas consumption, but shifts have occurred during the past decade in the consumption levels of individual consumer groups. Industry's gas consumption has decreased, while power stations increased their gas consumption. Commercial and residential consumers maintained flat gas consumption patterns. This study introduces the Weighted Average Cost of Retail Gas (WACORG) as a tool to calculate and monitor an average retail price based on the different natural gas prices charged to the traditional consumer groups. The WACORG also provides insight in wellhead revenues and may be used as an instrument for calibrating retail prices in support of wellhead price-floor regulation. Such price-floor regulation is advocated here as a possible mitigation measure against excessive volatility in US wellhead gas prices to improve the security of gas supply. "

                    "abstract": "Stock-listed independents have played a leading role in the development of unconventional natural-gas resources in the United States and Canada. Shareholders have provided up to 57% of the total capital tied up in a representative panel comprising the 20 leading US and Canadian operators. The accumulated equity-financed capital also provided the collateral for the complementary 43% debt financing. Prudent management of shareholder value in unconventional-gas businesses is therefore essential for ensuring security of gas supply, not only in North America, but also in other countries with emergent unconventional gas plays. This study analyzes and benchmarks the working capital cycles in unconventional-gas companies. The working capital and cashflow cycles are compared with those of diversified oil and gas majors. The ability to accumulate retained earnings is generally much lower for unconventional-gas producers than for integrated majors. Unconventional-gas producers tend to grow their share capital by new issues and not from economic value added by profit from business operations. Although little or no asset value is built from economic profit, shareholder returns may still grow for unconventional-gas companies as long as investor expectations remain positive about future earnings. In contrast, shareholder returns in conventional-gas companies come from genuine economic value added in profitable business operations. The root cause of the weakness or absence of operational profits in unconventional-gas operations is a combination of low gas prices and well flow rates that are too modest to pay for the total cost of the unconventional-gas production. The operating margins for unconventional-gas companies are either close to zero or negative, but not for the integrated oil and gas majors, which have impressive cash margins even at globally suppressed gas prices. The benchmarks provided here help one to understand which parameters impact the financial performance of unconventional-natural-gas companies most significantly. Recommendations are formulated to avoid the destruction of shareholder value, and to instead maximize total shareholder returns (TSRs). "
