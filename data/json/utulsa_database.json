                    "abstract": "The objectives of this study are to develop a new approximate analytical solution for predicting drawdown temperature transient behavior of a fully penetrating vertical well in a radial composite reservoir system and to use it as a forward model for estimating the fluid flow and thermal parameters of the system by nonlinear regression. The analytical solution considers a radial composite reservoir model, where the inner zone may represent a skin zone and the outer zone represents an infinitely extended reservoir. The analytical solution for predicting sandface temperatures is obtained by solving the decoupled isothermal diffusivity (pressure) and temperature equations for the inner and outer zones by using the Boltzmann transformation. The convection, transient adiabatic expansion and Joule-Thomson heating effects are all considered in solving the temperature equation. The developed analytical solution is validated by using both a commercial non-isothermal numerical simulator and a semianalytical solution available in the literature for different synthetic cases. For estimating the system parameters by history matching of observed temperature and/or pressure data with the model, we use the Levenberg-Marquardt method. We investigate the impact of noise in temperature and/or pressure data on the estimated parameters by inspecting statistical measures such as confidence intervals and correlation coefficients between parameter pairs. It is observed that selecting proper initial guesses of parameter is critical for estimating reliable values of the parameters through nonlinear regression of temperature data because the parameters are more correlated in the temperature equation than in pressure equation. Hence, we provide an effective methodology based on semi-log analysis and log-log diagnostic plots of pressure and temperature data to obtain good initial guesses of parameters that will derive the nonlinear regression method to have refined optimized estimates. The results show that the rock, fluid and thermal properties of the skin zone and non-skin zone can be reliably estimated from sandface temperature transient data jointly with pressure transient data in presence of noise, recorded during constant-rate drawdown tests with our approximate solutions and effective methodology proposed for obtaining initial guesses of the parameters.

                    "abstract": "This paper presents new semilog-straight-line and temperature-derivative methods for interpreting and analyzing sandface-temperature transient data from constant-rate drawdown and buildup tests conducted in infinite-acting reservoirs containing slightly compressible fluid of constant compressibility and viscosity. The procedures are dependent on the analytical solutions accounting for Joule-Thomson (J-T) heating/cooling, adiabatic-fluid expansion, and conduction and convection effects. The development of the analytical solutions is dependent on the fact that the effects of temperature changes on pressure-transient data can be neglected so that the pressure-diffusivity and thermal-energy-balance equations can be decoupled. The analytical solutions are verified by and are found in excellent agreement with the solutions of a commercial nonisothermal reservoir simulator. It is shown that drawdown and buildup sandface-temperature data may exhibit three infinite-acting radial-flow (IARF) periods (represented by semilog equations): one at early times reflecting the adiabatic expansion/compression effects, another at intermediate times reflecting the J-T expansion in the skin zone if skin exists, and the third at late times reflecting J-T expansion effects in the nonskin zone. Performing semilog analyses by use of these IARF regimes gives estimates of permeability of skin and nonskin zones as well as the radius of the skin zone, assuming that the J-T coefficient of the fluid and the viscosity are known. Parameters such as skin-zone permeability and radius are not readily accessible from conventional pressure-transient analysis (PTA) from which only the skin factor and nonskin-zone permeability can be obtained. The applicability of the proposed analysis procedure is demonstrated by considering synthetic and field-test data. The results indicate that the analysis procedure provides reliable estimates of skin-zone and nonskin-zone permeability and skin-zone radius from drawdown or buildup temperature data jointly with pressure data.

The solutions consider flow of a slightly compressible, single-phase fluid in a homogeneous infinite-acting reservoir system with skin modeled as a composite zone adjacent to the wellbore and account for the Joule-Thomson (J-T) heating/cooling, adiabatic-fluid expansion, conduction and convection effects both in the wellbore and reservoir. They are developed depending on the assumption that the effects of temperature changes on wellbore and reservoir-pressure-transient data can be neglected so that the mass-, momentum-, and energy-balance equations in the wellbore and reservoir can be decoupled. The semianalytical solution for predicting sandface temperatures is verified by use of a general-purpose thermal simulator. Wellbore temperatures at a certain gauge depth are evaluated through the analytical steady-state and transient-wellbore-temperature equations coupled with a semianalytical reservoir-temperature model accounting for conservation of momentum in the wellbore. Results show that drawdown- and buildup-sandface-temperature data may exhibit two semilog straight lines: one at early times reflecting the effects of adiabatic-fluid expansion in the skin zone near the wellbore, and the other, the late-time semilog straight line, reflecting the J-T effects and exhibiting the nonskin-zone properties. However, the wellbore-temperature measurements made at locations above the producing horizon may not exhibit these semilog straight lines because they are strongly dependent upon distance above the producing horizon, geothermal gradient, and radial-heat losses from the wellbore fluid to the formation on the way to gauge. It is found that the skin-zone properties are very difficult to be estimated from drawdown- and buildup-wellbore temperatures unless the gauge location is not far from the producing zone. Specifically, we found that buildup-wellbore temperature is mostly dominated by wellbore-heat losses compared with drawdown-wellbore-temperature data, and hence may not be useful to estimate the formation properties, including skin-zone properties.

Slightly compressible, single-phase, and homogeneous infinite-acting single-layer reservoir system is considered. The models account for Joule-Thomson heating/cooling, adiabatic fluid expansion, conduction and convection effects both in the reservoir and wellbore. The reservoir model includes the effect of heat losses to over-burden and under-burden strata. The transient wellbore model accounts for friction and gravity effects. The solutions of the semi-analytical reservoir model are verified by use of a general purpose thermal simulator. Wellbore temperatures at a certain gauge depth are evaluated through a wellbore thermal energy equation coupling the reservoir temperature equation. Our results show that unlike pressure transient data, the variable-rate temperature transient data cannot be transformed to an equivalent constant-rate temperature data by use of linear superposition. It is shown that the temperature-derivative data taken with respect to the elapsed time for a given period, plotted against elapsed time better identifies flow regimes exhibited by the transient temperature data recorded under variable rate history. Furthermore, we show that the temperature measurements made at locations above the producing horizon are dependent upon the flow rate, geothermal gradient, and radial heat losses from the wellbore fluid to the formation on the way to gauge. The temperature responses during early times of drawdown and buildup periods are mainly affected by the thermal and wellbore storage effects and do not exhibit the early-, intermediate- and late-time infinite acting flow regimes (IARFs) that would be exhibited by the sandface temperatures unless the gauge distance is not close to the producing horizon. The sensitivity of temperature recorded above the producing zone to reservoir permeability and skin decreases with gauge placed far away above the producing zone. Synthetic test examples are presented to demonstrate the use of the proposed models and methods. "

The models are capable of simulating bottomhole transient temperatures from multi-rate production tests including buildups. We provide interpretation/analysis methodology based on temperature-derivative and straight line methods for estimating near wellbore and far field formation parameters from temperature transient data. Slightly compressible, single-phase, and homogeneous infinite-acting single-layer reservoir system is considered.

For temperature measurements made at locations above the producing horizon, wellbore transient temperature is dependent upon the flowrate, distance above the producing horizon, geothermal gradient, and radial heat losses from the wellbore fluid to the formation on the way to gauge. Depending upon these parameters, transient temperature response at early times may be almost solely reflective of the wellbore/thermal storage effects, and the flow regimes that are exhibited by the sandface temperatures are distorted due to heat losses effects between the wellbore and the formation adjacent to the wellbore. Synthetic test examples demonstrate the use of the models and methods proposed to interpret and analyze bottomhole temperature transient data. "

In addition to the theory, as a case study, one of the largest Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) gas field, Çayirdere Field, reserves is estimated, and uncertainties for this field reserve are presented at all-time steps. As a result, the estimated value of the most likely reserve (P50) by utilization of AUPM in conjunction with probabilistic methodology prior to production period, matches quite well with the value estimated at the abandonment of the reservoir by using performance-based methods.

                    "abstract": "Pressure transient tests can provide useful information for characterization and evaluation of reservoirs under secondary and tertiary processes if they are properly designed and analyzed. There are a number of literature concerning the injection and falloff testing of water or gas injection wells. However, information available on immiscible water alternating gas (IWAG) injection tests is limited to falloff tests without considering the effect of trapped gas and capillary pressure. In this study, the pressure transient behavior of IWAG injection and falloff tests with and without relative permeability hysteresis and capillary pressure effects is investigated using simulated pressure data. The oil, gas, and water saturations distribution show that gas relative-permeability hysteresis improves the displacement of oil in IWAG injection. However, when capillary pressure is included, more oil is left behind the front. The pressure-derivative curves of falloff periods following gas injection period exhibit a long transition period with a half-slope line before the late-time radial flow for all cases, whereas, the pressure-derivative curve of the water injection falloff period after first gas injection for the case without hysteresis and capillary pressure exhibits a quarter-slope line in the long transition period. It is shown that trapped gas (or hysteresis in gas relative permeability) and capillary pressure have significant effects on the pressure and pressure-derivative behaviors of injection tests, but less effect on falloff tests. The findings of the study not only provide new insights to the pressure transient behavior of injection and falloff tests conducted during IWAG injection operations, but also should prove useful when properly interpreting and analyzing such tests.

Such tests are often called WFT interval pressure transient tests or simply WFT IPTTs. IPTTs offer some advantages over the conventional (extended) well tests in terms of cost, time, and providing important properties such as horizontal and vertical permeability over a scale larger than cores but smaller than that of extended well tests. In this project, the same methodology applied to a packer-probe WFT in single layer system will be applied to various multi-layered systems to investigate the feasibility and validity of using the single-layer analysis methodology for the WFT IPTTs conducted in multi-layered systems because only a few of researchers have considered interpretation of packer-probe interval pressure-transient tests in multi-layered systems. Thus, one of the main objectives in this study is in detail to access the methodology used for analyzing a single layer system and apply the same to multi-layered systems. Various averaging formulas of horizontal and vertical permeabilities will be used to represent a multi-layered system. The validity of the representation is tested through pressure response matching. The results show that an “equivalent” single-layer analysis based arithmetic averages of the horizontal and vertical permeability can be used to analyze the IPTTs acquired in multi-layered systems provided that the heterogeneity is not large (i.e., Dykstra-Parsons coefficient is less than 0.4 for spherical flow analysis and is less than 0.06 for radial-flow analysis). Introduction Wireline formation testing is a part of pressure transient testing methods. It is an evolution of DST, Drill Stem Test. DST usage is limited to the hole condition and the cost of repetitive runs of DST for formation evaluation. Thus, wireline formation tester is often used for formation evaluation work. This method is usually performed in an open-hole using a cable-operated formation tester with sampling module ability which is anchored down-hole while the communication is established by several pressure and sampling probes.  The first tool was introduced in the 1950’s concentrated on fluid sampling. RFT (Repeat Formation Tester) is then introduced to add capability of the tool to repeatedly measure formation pressure in a single run into the well (Ireland et al. 1992). Since 1962, common applications of wireline formation tester are: According to (Schlumberger, 2006), pressure transient tests are conducted at all stages in the life of a reservoir; exploration, development, production and injection. During exploration stage, tests are conducted to obtain fluid samples and static pressures of all permeable layers of interest. These pressures can be used to obtain formation fluid gradient to identify fluid contact in the reservoir. During development stage, the emphasis is on static reservoir pressures, which are used to confirm fluid contacts and fluid density gradients. On that basis, the different hydraulic compartments of the reservoir will be determined and tied into geological model. During production stage, tests are for reservoir monitoring and productivity tests to access to need for stimulation. "

The equilibrium CO2 solubility into the reservoir brine, and crude oil, and the effect of foaming agent surfactants on the CO2 solubility into the aqueous phase are measured by using an equilibrium high pressure cell. The interfacial tension (IFT) measurements of gas–liquid and liquid–liquid systems are accomplished by utilizing the axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) adapted in a pendant drop tensiometer. Two in-house developed surfactants (FomaxII and FomaxVII) are compared with the industrial bench-mark surfactant, alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS), for the structure–property analysis. FomaxVII is a blend of anionic and amphoteric surfactants, with a short-branched chain structure which contains CO2-philic groups. FomaxII is a blend of anionic surfactants, with long, straight-tail hydrocarbon structure. The results show that the dissolution of CO2 into the aqueous phase increased significantly in the presence of 1 wt% surfactants at the reservoir prevailing conditions. A relationship was also observed between the surfactant molecular structure and its effect on the CO2/aqueous phase interface. The results of this study are useful to evaluate the mechanisms of immiscible CO2 flooding as well as to design the foam assisted CO2-EOR applications for the case Malaysian or similar oil reservoir.

The methodology consists of a two-step procedure; first selecting the appropriate lumped-parameter model that can best describe the geothermal system based on history matching observed pressure and/or temperature datasets and then using a randomized maximum likelihood (RML) like method for the assessment of uncertainty. Any uncertainties in both the model and the measured data may be incorporated into the future performance predictions for the pressure. Once the uncertainty in predicted performance is characterized and assessed, it becomes possible to make reservoir management decisions that account for an incomplete knowledge of the actual geothermal system. One synthetic application and one field application from the Balçova-Narlıdere geothermal field in İzmir, Turkey are presented to illustrate the methodology. "

                    "abstract": "In this work, we present a method for efficiently and accurately simulating the pressure-transient behavior of oil/water flow associated with water-injection/falloff tests. The method uses the Laplace-transform finite-difference (LTFD) method coupled with the well-known Buckley-Leverett frontal-advance formula to solve the radial diffusivity equation describing slightly compressible oil/water two-phase flow. The method is semianalytical in time, and as a result, the issue of time discretization in the finite-difference approximation method is eliminated. Thus, stability and convergence problems caused by time discretization are avoided. Two approaches are presented and compared in terms of accuracy for simulating the tests with multiple-rate injection and falloff periods: One is based on solving the initial-boundary-value (IVB) problem with the initial condition attained from the end of the previous flow period, and the other is based on the conventional superposition on the basis of the single-phase flow of a slightly compressible fluid. The former is shown to always provide a more accurate and efficient solution. The method is quite general in that it allows one to incorporate the effect of wellbore storage and thick-skin and finite outer-boundary conditions. The accuracy of the method was evaluated by considering various synthetic test cases with favorable and unfavorable mobility ratios and by comparing the pressure and pressure-derivative signatures with a commercial black-oil simulator, and an excellent agreement was seen.

                    "abstract": "Asphaltene precipitation and deposition may occur during natural depletion, displacement of reservoir oil by CO2, hydrocarbon gas or WAG application. They can affect reservoir performance and cause formation damage such as porosity and permeability reduction, wettability alteration, and relative permeability changes. Moreover, asphaltene deposition may lead to plugging of wellbore and production surface facilities. The dynamic displacement efficiency in porous media is controlled by relative permeability, and asphaltene deposition can alter the original characteristics of the relative permeability. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no correlation available in the literature that can be used to predict the relative permeability alteration due to asphaltene deposition which considers the amount of asphaltene as an independent variable. Although the exact physics on how this alteration occurs is still a research topic, it has been reported that some of its effect may be captured by wettability change and relative permeability shift from a water-wet to an oil-wet (or a mixed-wet) system. In this paper, new experimental correlations are presented to predict the effect of asphaltene deposition on irreducible water saturation, residual oil saturation, and relative permeability for water-oil systems. The correlations are obtained by history matching the experimental data from the several dynamic displacement experiments (conducted on the different core-plug samples, but having the same rock properties under reservoir conditions) with the corresponding data from a two-phase one-dimension black-oil simulation model.

Introduction Permeability and permeability anisotropy are some of the most important parameters for both reservoir management and well performance. Permeability and its anisotropy strongly affect all reservoir displacement processes. Thus, estimation of the individual values of horizontal and vertical permeability is becoming increasingly important as emphasis shifts from primary to secondary and tertiary recovery. Interval pressure transient testing (IPTT) using packer-probe or probe-probe wireline formation testers provides dynamic permeability and anisotropy information with increased vertical resolution along the wellbore. The test can be conducted by withdrawing fluid with a single-probe formation testing tool (Fig. 1) or a dual-packer formation testing tool(Figs. 2 and 3) (e.g., see Zimmerman et al. 1990; Goode and Thambynayagam 1992; Pop et al. 1993; Kuchuk et al. 1994). Fig. 1 shows a schematic of an observation probe with a single probe flowing (or simply, a sink probe), whereas Fig. 2 is a schematic for a dual-packer module. In these figures the wellbore is vertical. (For more information on the terms \"vertical?? and \"horizontal,?? see Appendix A entitled as \"Terminology.??) Fig. 3 illustrates the case of a dual-packer module in an inclined wellbore; likewise, the single-probe module can be deployed in an inclined well (not shown). "

It is well known that the late-time periods in particular of the deconvolved responses from the recent pressure-rate deconvolution methods are dependent on the initial reservoir pressure. A small error in the initial reservoir pressure could make a significant difference in the late-time periods of the deconvolved responses that can lead to an incorrect interpretation model, particularly misinterpretation of the boundaries. The new method presented is based on pressure-derivative data rather than pressure data that are used in all published deconvolution algorithms. Using pressure-derivative data in deconvolution leads to a nonlinear least-squares objective function that is different from those used in the earlier deconvolution methods and eliminates the dependency of the deconvolved responses on the initial reservoir pressure. Therefore, the new method minimizes incorrect interpretation because of an error or uncertainty in the initial reservoir pressure. We apply the new method to both simulated and field pressure-transient data sets. The results show that the new method offers a significant advantage over the earlier deconvolution methods for pressure-transient-test interpretation in cases where the initial reservoir pressure is unknown or uncertain.

                    "abstract": "Abstract In oil and natural gas production projects, many investment and development plans are based on oil and gas reserve estimates. There is a large uncertainty in the calculation of hydrocarbon reserves because the input variables always contain uncertainties to some degree that propagate into reserve estimates. From the view point of a field investment, an accurate assessment of uncertainty in reserves is crucial for making decisions that will create value and/or mitigate loss in value. Therefore, to make good decisions, one must be able to accurately assess and manage the uncertainties and risks. In this study, we present an analytical uncertainty propagation method (AUPM) for modeling of uncertainties on volumetric reserve estimations. Analytical uncertainty propagation equations (AUPEs) are derived based on a Taylor-series expansion around the mean values of the input variables. The AUPEs are general in that correlation among the input variables, if it exists, can also be accounted for on the resulting uncertainty. Comparative studies that we have conducted show that the AUPM is as accurate as the Monte Carlo method (MCM). The AUPM provides a fast alternative to Monte Carlo simulation for accurately characterizing uncertainty markers such as variance, P90, P50, and P10. In addition, we present uncertainty percentage coefficient for simulating uncertainty contribution of each parameter and correlated parameter pairs to the total uncertainty in volumetric calculations. We also discuss the problem of probabilistic aggregation of reserves for projects involving more than one reservoir or field. We provide a general analytical formulation for estimating the values of mean, variance, P10, P50 and P90 for aggregated estimates. Probabilistic aggregation requires the knowledge of pair-wise correlation of the fields. In this study, we propose uncertainty sorting method (USM) to determine pair-wise correlation coefficients for multiple resources. The method provides a simple and fast analytical approach based on uncertainty percentage coefficient of individual field parameters. Proposed analytical models can be used as a fast tool eliminating the need for MCM. 1. Introduction Uncertainty is inherent in estimation of any type of resources from underground energy systems. Unfortunately, this is also true regardless of any method used for estimation, e.g., volumetric, decline curve, or reservoir simulation methods because the input variables required for the estimation problem always contain uncertainties to some degree that propagate into estimates. Therefore, to make good decisions, one must be able to accurately assess and manage the uncertainties and risks. In this work, we limit our study to the assessment of uncertainty in oil and gas reserves estimated and probabilistic resource aggregation by the volumetric methods. Volumetric methods are usually used in the early life of oil and gas reservoirs. Estimation of the resources/reserves requires geological, geophysical, and petro-physical data including reservoir area, thickness, porosity, saturations, etc. The values of these input variables have usually large uncertainties associated with them; hence it is very important to propagate these uncertainties on to the estimation of hydrocarbon reserves or resources. Although we use the terms reserve and resources interchangeably here and throughout this paper, their definitions differ indeed; normally reserve is defined as the economically recoverable part of a resource. From the view point of a field investment, an accurate assessment of uncertainty in recoverable and in place reserves is a crucial task from which to make decisions that will create value and/or mitigate loss in value (risk).

                    "abstract": "Abstract Water alternating gas (WAG) injection has been a popular method for commercial gas injection projects worldwide. The injection of water and gas alternatively offers better mobility control of gas and hence, improves the volumetric sweep efficiency. Although the WAG process is conceptually sound, its field incremental recovery is disappointing as it rarely exceeds 5 to 10 % OOIP. Apart from operational problems, the WAG mechanism suffers from inherent challenges such as water blocking, gravity segregation, mobility control in high viscosity oil, decreased oil relative permeability, and decreased gas injectivity.  This paper addresses the aforementioned problems and proposes a new combination method, named as the chemically enhanced water alternating gas (CWAG), to improve the efficiency of WAG process. The unique feature of this new method is that it uses alkaline, surfactant, and polymer as a chemical slug which will be injected during WAG process to reduce the interfacial tension (IFT) and improve the mobility ratio. In a CWAG process, a chemical slug is chased by water, preceded by gas slug and followed by alternate CO2 and water slug or chemical slug injects after one cycle of gas and water slug. Essentially CWAG involves a combination of chemical flooding and immiscible carbon dioxide (CO2) injections. These mechanisms are IFT reduction, reducing water blocking effect, mobility control, oil viscosity reduction due to the CO2 dissolution and oil swelling.  CMG's STARS was used to study the performance of the new method using some of the data found in the literature. It is a chemical flood simulator that can simulate all aspects of chemical flooding, and it can also handle immiscible CO2 injection features by considering K-value partitioning. The sensitivity analysis shows that the new method gives a better recovery when compared to conventional WAG. This study shows the potential of CWAG to enhance oil recovery.  Introduction Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) refers to a variety of processes to increase the amount of oil extracted from a reservoir after primary and secondary recoveries, typically by injecting liquid chemicals (e.g., surfactant) or gas (e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide) or the use of thermal energy. The injected fluids compliment the natural energy of the reservoir or interact with the reservoir rock/oil system to create favorable conditions for oil recovery (Green and Willhite 1998). The concept of EOR has gained popularity as the global demand for supply of oil has increased. It is generally known that about two-thirds of original oil in place (OOIP) remains unrecovered after primary and secondary recovery (pressure maintenance, water flooding). The remaining oil exists as trapped, immobile oil droplets due to high capillary forces between water and oil droplets. Hence, EOR methods are key factors to extend and maximize production from existing oil and gas fields. The economic potential of providing new methods for increased and enhanced oil recovery is significant. It therefore represents a subject of great interest as it provides a means to optimize production and resource management. "

The investigation is limited to interference tests for which only a single source/sink well exists in a single-layer system. It is shown that the recent deconvolution algorithms developed for pressure-rate (p-r) deconvolution based on the same limitation (i.e., a single source/sink well) can also be used for performing p-p deconvolution by simply replacing the rate data in p-r deconvolution algorithms by the pressure data recorded at a source/sink location or at one of the observation locations. We show the applications of p-p deconvolution to both synthetic and field-transient test data sets from IPTTs and multiwall-interference tests. Specifically, we investigate the applicability of p-p deconvolution for inconsistent data sets where wellbore storage and skin may change from one flow period to another one. The results show that the impulse functions deconvolved from p-p deconvolution have signatures for various flow regimes (e.g., radial, spherical, linear) that are similar to those of p-r deconvolution except from the pseudosteady-state (pss)-flow regime, and, hence, could be used for model identification purposes in the similar way based on p-r deconvolution, but without requiring the flow-rate information.

It is shown that the procedure provides unique estimates of horizontal and vertical permeabilities from observation-probe pressure data obtained along both vertical and horizontal wellbores. However, for slanted-well cases, the analysis procedure yields two possible solutions for the horizontal and vertical permeabilities. Therefore, one must use a priori information on permeabilities, from sources such as core data or pretests, to help identify the appropriate solution for the slantedwell cases. For the more general case of a 3D anisotropic medium, except for the vertical wellbores, an estimate of the anisotropy ratio and the azimuth angle of the well are also required as inputs for determining the values of horizontal and vertical permeability with our analysis procedure. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed analysis procedure by considering two synthetic and two field packer-probe data sets from vertical and slanted wellbores. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract We present and compare three different grid-based inversion methods for estimation of formation parameters and spatial geological feature identification based on pressure transient test (PTT) data from multiple-well locations. The first and second methods employ efficient adjoint schemes to determine the gradient of the objective functions resulting in the most likely set of reservoir parameters and an ensemble of updated realizations of the parameters, respectively. The second method is based on the Langevin equation. The third method uses ensemble Kalman filtering (EnKF) for data assimilation, in which the outcome is an ensemble of updated parameter realizations. These three methods use a grid-independent prior model (in view of the limited prior knowledge of the system expected to be available), described by as few parameters as possible, and consider a non-uniform grid with the highest resolution near the wells. With these methods, the existence of and location of many sub-seismic features such as strong spatial permeability variations, faults, fractures and pinch outs may be determined using exploration and production data. Such features may not be known a priori, particularly in the exploration of heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs.  We examine each method considering the degree of prior information required, the computational overhead and the applicability to the reservoir characterization workflow. Our results indicate that the first method provides a good history match to the observed PTT data and is suited for the early exploration phase of the reservoir. However, the parameters must be convolved with the smaller scale data to produce multiple realizations away from the implausibly smooth most-likely solution. The observed PTT data lies within the ensemble of predicted pressures in the EnKF and Langevin-based methods which are both applicable to probabilistic workflows where uncertainty is treated rigorously. However, EnKF seems to be computationally more efficient than the Langevin approach.  Introduction Pressure transient testing (PTT) is a long established procedure for determining the productivity of a well and the properties of the formation (reservoir) from downhole and/or surface pressure and flow rate measurements. The main steps for interpretation are:-  1. Model identification: a possible set of reservoir models are found that may fit the data, 2. Model parameter estimation: the model parameters are adjusted until the model behavior matches the observed data, 3. Model verification: the consistency of the final model is verified by measuring the mismatch between the real system and the model or by comparison with other data.  Using conventional interpretation methods (semilog methods such as Horner or MDH, and/or type-curve matching of measured pressure and/or derivative), reservoir pressure, an effective ‘average' permeability of the formation, skin factor, wellbore storage, etc. can be estimated from the PTT data. In such interpretation, some sort of prior modeling is always necessary to constrain the non-linear parameter estimation because a model with many non-physical reservoir parameters may match the observed PTT data. This prior knowledge may be available at small scale from logs and cores and, at a larger scale, from seismic and outcrop analogies. Recently, non-linear least-squares optimization has been applied to pressure transient data using numerical models with a similarly limited number of parameters; often models that are divided into a small number of regions, within which the reservoir parameters are assumed to be constant.

                    "title": "A New Pressure-Rate Deconvolution Technique Based on Pressure Derivatives for Pressure Transient Test Interpretation",
                    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we present a new deconvolution method that removes the dependency of the deconvolved constant-rate drawdown responses to the initial reservoir pressure. As is well known, particularly the late-time portions of the deconvolved responses from the recent pressure-rate (p-r) deconvolution algorithms are dependent on the initial reservoir pressure. A small error in the initial reservoir pressure could make a significant difference in the late-time portions of the deconvolved responses that can easily lead to an incorrect interpretation model, particularly misinterpretation of the boundaries. The new method presented is based on pressure-derivative data rather than pressure data that are used in all published deconvolution algorithms. Using pressure-derivative data in deconvolution leads to a nonlinear least-squares objective function that is different from those used in the earlier deconvolution methods and eliminates the dependency of the deconvolved responses to the initial reservoir pressure. Hence, the new method minimizes incorrect interpretation due to an error or uncertainty in the initial reservoir pressure.  We apply the new method to both simulated and field pressure-transient data sets. The results show that the new method offers a significant advantage over the earlier deconvolution methods for pressure transient test interpretation in cases where the initial reservoir pressure is unknown or uncertain.  Introduction During the last decade, pressure-rate (p-r) deconvolution algorithms have been improved significantly, and a few algorithms are now available via commercial well-test interpretation software. Pressure-rate deconvolution makes available an equivalent constant-rate drawdown pressure and its Bourdet derivative (derivative with respect to the natural logarithm of time, see Bourdet et al. 1989) to be used for system identification and interpretation. Recent publications demonstrate the uses of pressure-rate deconvolution for pressure transient wireline formation and well-test data as well as permanent pressure gauge data (von Schroeter et al. 2004, Levitan 2005, Ilk et al. 2006, Onur et al. 2008, Pimonov et al. 2009, and Kuchuk et al. 2010). In all p-r deconvolution algorithms mentioned above, the value of initial reservoir pressure has to be known. If it is unknown or uncertain, the initial reservoir pressure must be treated as an unknown parameter to be determined by history matching measured pressure data. Although the earlier deconvolution algorithms, except the one described by Ilk et al., allow one to treat the initial reservoir pressure as an unknown parameter in deconvolution history matching, numerical experiments with these algorithms show that one could determine the appropriate value of the initial reservoir pressure only for some limited cases of pressure/rate data sets, e.g., consistent pressure/rate data sets with the deconvolution model assumed by the algorithms (for example see, Levitan et al. 2006 and Onur et al. 2008). The algorithms assume that the convolution integral given below is linear and the relationship between the flow rate qm(t) and the wellbore pressure pm(t) is given by Duhamel's convolution integral (van Everdingen and Hurst 1949): Equation (1) where p0 is the initial reservoir, and T is the total duration of pressure/rate measurements. Equation 1 applies to test data sets from a single source/sink well in the reservoir, i.e., no interference for other wells. Hence, for such cases, qm represents the measured flow rate at the source/sink well, whereas pm represents the measured pressure either at the wellbore of the source/sink well or at the wellbore of an observation well. In Eq. 1, for a given time period, each wellbore/reservoir system has a characteristic unit-impulse function (or response) g(t) at the source/sink well or at the observation well where pm is measured. The unit-impulse function g(t) is a time derivative of constant-unit-rate drawdown pressure change pu(t), i.e., g(t) = dpu(t)/dt. "

The semianalytic method has been extended to 3D flows to serve as acompute engine for a new generation of reservoir management and optimizationtools. Well-placement strategy in infill programs is strongly dependent upon thereservoir development plan and the present stage in that overallplan.Often, well patterns are deployed based upon uniform permeabilitymodels; however, the role of reservoir heterogeneity can beformidable.Most wells are placed as production wells and selectivelyconverted to injectors as fields mature and interwell communication patternsbecome increasingly important.While reservoir engineers have numericalsimulation methods capable of reservoir performance feedback with regard tocandidate well placement, many of these models have inherent restrictions onthe ability to accurately model well performance.Few reservoir engineershave the luxury to discretize on the level of the wellbore radius, but ratherrely on block-centered, wellbore coupling correlations.Well productionengineers utilize models with fine-scale discretization; however, their inflowperformance predictions can be limited in reservoir scope.

Stream-function solutions can then form the basis for other performance measures, such as improved oil recovery efficiency estimation or tracer flow analysis. Moving beyond structured grids into unstructured grid geometry allows for advanced flexibility in problem development and improved efficiency in solution construction.  The analytic approach avoids the need for numerical differentiation of the pressure field and particle tracking methods to recover streamlines.  Capturing flow in highly heterogeneous media, without local grid refinement, is demonstrated to showcase the robustness of the technique in handling complex reservoir architecture, of particular interest in optimal well positioning and optimal well-pattern development. The solution to fluid flow problems is typically a map of the driving force (i.e., potential or pressure).  A more intuitive result is a map that shows actual trajectories of fluid elements, the stream function (Muskat 1937).  Potential, F, and stream-function, ?, are related in 2D by their spatial gradients. (Eq. 1) Curves of constant stream-function value are the so-called streamlines.  Stream-function indexing is associated with integration, as the difference in stream-function indices represents the amount of fluid flowing between streamlines of those fixed values.  By definition, no fluid convection occurs across a streamline.  Unfortunately, the concept of stream function is restricted to two dimensions.  While an orthogonal mesh to the pressure field can certainly be constructed in 3D, an equivalent of stream function is found in three dimensions only for flows exhibiting symmetry properties that effectively reduce the dimensionality of the flow problem.

                    "abstract": "Newly-developed, generalized analytic solutions to the heat equation for arbitrary 3D well trajectory in anisotropic media are demonstrated to solve benchmark horizontal and slanted well productivity problems with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Arbitrary well trajectory is constructed as an assemblage of spatially integrated, linear well segments, as opposed to a distribution of numerically integrated point sources, to provide advantages in both computational speed and accuracy in singularity handling. Production from each arbitrarily-oriented segment is reduced to a combination of purely analytic expressions and rapidly-convergent, exponentially-damped infinite sum approximations. With offered flexibility in cell boundary conditions, the expressions can yield stand-alone well productivity estimates for complex wells or serve as the basis for advanced well equations, if integrated within a numerical reservoir simulator. Transients are also computed with analytical integrations in time, thus requiring no time marching. The breakthrough speed and accuracy in productivity assessment opens possibilities for advanced well testing and reservoir characterization methods. We further demonstrate the usefulness of analytic methodology with several time-dependent, discrete fracture problems for shale gas production with typical Barnett conditions, allowing direct use of complex fracture patterns, such as those interpreted from microseismic. In addition to uniform flux and uniform pressure modeling options, a new analytic model is introduced that is capable of modeling both time-dependent material transport  between matrix and a stimulated zone and the interplay between a well and fracture. We illustrate our solution method with fractured Barnett well examples from the literature. With optional effects such as gas desorption and stress-dependent fracture conductivity as easy add-ons, we can produce full operational life production forecasts for shale or tight gas reservoirs from discrete, complex fracture patterns along with reservoir pressure mappings in a matter of minutes on common PC platforms.  Introduction Much of the early development in modeling and characterizing reservoirs was based upon closed-form mathematical solutions to governing equations (Muskat, 1949; Earlougher, 1977; Matthews and Russell, 1967). These, so-called, analytic solutions were amenable for only the simplest of reservoir descriptions and well configurations.  The industry turned to numerical methods and computers for solving more complex problems. However, the physical size of a wellbore, nominally 6 inches, is far below the resolution of most numerical reservoir simulations.  Peaceman (1978, 1983), in his pioneering work, introduced the well equation (well block/cell radius) that connected reservoir grid cell (block) to field-observables of pressure and flow rate measurements.  Some practitioners used local grid refinement around wells, dramatically increasing the computational overhead with greater risk of problem numerical instability.

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods require injectivity and interwell communication on reasonable time scales. We conduct a feasibility study for the application of recycled lean gas injection to displace reservoir fluids between zipper fracs in liquid-rich shales. Using new analytical solutions to the Diffusivity equation for arbitrarily-oriented line sources/sinks plus superposition, we analyze the time for inter-fracture communication development, i.e. interference, and productivity index for both classical bi-wing fractures in a zipper configuration and complex fracture networks. We are able to map both pressure and pressure temporal derivative as a function of time and space for production and/or injection from parallel motherbores under the infinite conductivity wellbore and fracture assumption. The infinite conductivity assumption could be later relaxed for more general cases. We couch the results in terms of geometrical spacing requirement for both horizontal wells and stimulation treatments to achieve reasonable time frames for inter-fracture communication and sweep for parameters typical of various shale plays. We further analyze whether spacing currently considered for primary production is sufficient for direct implementation of EOR or if current practice should be modified with EOR in the field development plan.

Microimaging capabilities at Brookhaven Natl. Laboratory's Natl. Synchrotron Light Source have been enhanced to provide larger and higher resolution 3D renderings of pore networks in reservoir rocks at a fraction of the time required in previous first generation scanning methods. Such data are used to model single and multiphase flow properties in digital images of real porous media. Pore networks are analyzed for tortuosity and connectivity measures, which have been elusive parameters in transport property models. We present examples of porosimetry simulation through network modeling to produce initial water saturation and residual oil distributions in a water-wet pore system. Furthermore, pore networks can provide the boundary condition framework for more rigorous simulations of displacement, such as in the lattice Boltzmann simulated waterflood example provided. Direct comparison between simulation and experiment is also possible. CMT images of a 6-mm subsection of a 1-in. diameter reservoir core sample were obtained before and after flooding to residual oil. The fluid distributions from CMT, lattice Boltzmann waterflood simulation, and percolation-based network modeling were found to be highly correlated. Advances in 3D visualization will allow even greater digestion and interpretation of phenomena dependent upon pore interconnectivity and multipore interactions. P. 288 "

                    "abstract": "Pore networks derived from synchrotron X-ray microtomographic images of reservoir rocks were used to provide realistic geometries for simulation of oil displacement by water. The Lattice Boltzmann Method was used to compute two-phase flow dynamics with constant pore geometry—but different pressure driving forces and imposed wettability distributions at the pore wall boundaries. Such examinations can be used to formulate more physically meaningful functional forms for multiphase flow relations to replace empirical constructs of relative permeability with only implicit dependencies on wettability and pore structure. Each simulation started with the same low initial water saturation distribution achieved by primary drainage network simulation in an initially strongly water-wet, reasonably homogeneous pore system. Mixed-wet scenarios were produced by altering the boundary conditions of those surfaces contacted by the non-wetting phase in the initial water distribution image. In one set of simulations comparing water-wet and mixed-wet boundary conditions, capillary numbers in the vicinity of 10−4 were not low enough for differences in wettability to give markedly different displacement dynamics. In a second set of simulations, as the driving force for flow was reduced further, we saw differences in the fluid distributions, but only minor changes in the relative permeabilities extracted from simulation output. The biggest difference between waterflood simulations with different wettabilities appears to be the additional recovery possible after breakthrough in the mixed-wet scenario. Capillary pressure, and not relative permeability, controls whether or not a particular saturation state can be observed. It is therefore concluded that capturing wettability effects in capillary pressure relations is probably more important than trying to roll such effects into relative permeability functions. Wettability is expected to play a more important role in heterogeneous systems. "

                    "title": "Foam Flow Through an Oil-Wet Porous Medium: A Laboratory Study",
                    "abstract": "Summary A laboratory study of the steady generation and flow of gas and surfactantsolution through an oil-wet porous medium indicates that foam is formed and iseffective in reducing gas permeability. A comparison of the flowcharacteristics of foam in oil-wet and water-wet media showed that at similarsurfactant concentrations gas permeability reduction in both systems isapproximately equal. The ability to form stable foam in situ in an oil-wetporous medium appears to result from the alteration of the initiallyhydrophobic surface to hydrophilic by two mechanisms: surface tension reductionand surfactant adsorption. Wettability alteration of the hydrophobic surface isevidenced by a dramatic shift in liquid relative permeability when surfactantis present in the aqueous phase. The liquid permeability when surfactant ispresent in the aqueous phase. The liquid relative permeability curve of theoil-wet porous medium, in the presence of surfactant, essentially matched thatof the water-wet porous medium. Such shifts in liquid relative permeabilityhave not been observed for foam flow in strongly water-wet porous media. Noalteration in either liquid or gas relative permeability occurred with addedsurfactant when a residual mineral oil was present in the oil-wet system.Transient measurements, however, indicated the formation of foam in thewater-wet system when residual oil was present. Introduction Persoff et al. recently presented an excellent discussion on the Persoff etal. recently presented an excellent discussion on the fundamental behavior offoam flow through water-wet porous media. When an aqueous foam is injected intowater-wet porous media, the liquid phase and foam pseudophase move in the samepathways that liquid and gas would pass through if the system were pathwaysthat liquid and gas would pass through if the system were at the same capillarypressure. Furthermore, very little liquid is transported through the pores,where foam flows. Both these statements are supported by the observance ofessentially identical liquid relative permeability curves in both the presenceand absence of an added surfactant. Unchanged liquid relative permeabilitycurves when foam is present in porous media indicate that flow diversion willnot occur in present in porous media indicate that flow diversion will notoccur in the absence of an increased pressure gradient. Decreased injectivityof the steam/gas phase in the absence of an increased pressure gradient simplyindicates increased resistance to gas flow through the same pathways. Hence,flow diversion can occur only for increased values of the capillary pressure(which results in a smaller liquid saturation). Because foam flows in the poreswhere gas would normally flow, the foam occupies the larger pores in water-wetsystems. Hence, permeability reduction of the gas phase is tremendous becauselarger permeability reduction of the gas phase is tremendous because largerpores are most affected. Furthermore, as Nahid pointed out, the pores are mostaffected. Furthermore, as Nahid pointed out, the pore network occupied bynonwetting (gas) phase may have a pore network occupied by nonwetting (gas)phase may have a flowing foam fraction, depending on the foam mobilizationpressure gradient. Pressure drop through this flowing fraction will bedetermined largely by the number of lamellae and their lifetime relative to thepore transit time. The primary mechanism for foam generation in porous mediahas been proposed as capillary snap-off of the gas phase. Holm, while notexplicitly using the term \"snap-off,\" first observed foam formation bythis mechanism. Two types of snap-off have been postulated. The first consistsof liquid accumulation in pore throats, where the capillary pressure is largeenough to allow pore throats, where the capillary pressure is large enough toallow liquid flow through a continuous film from a pore opening into a poreconstriction. As Falls et al. noted, this type of pore constriction. As Fallset al. noted, this type of snap-off occurs only during imbibition in water-wetmedia. The second type of snap-off occurs in pores with L/d ratios greater thanpi and has been described for capillaries. This type of pore-level instabilityoccurs only for capillary pressures less pore-level instability occurs only forcapillary pressures less than the entry capillary pressure. Both of the abovesnap-off descriptions may be reduced to geometrical criteria at a given liquidsaturation. Lamellae production is also facilitated by stranding during theinitial gas displacement of a surfactant solution from pore interstices andlamellae division. The stability of foam, once it is generated, is presumed tobe a result of lamellae stabilization by pore walls. Furthermore, many lamellaepropagation models rely on the foundations developed by Bretherton. Each ofthese mechanisms presumes the existence of a water-wet state. Even Khatib etal.'s critical capillary pressure for foam destabilization relies on theassumption of a continuous wetting film between the small water-filled poresand the foam lamellae. Aqueous foam generation by snap-off is dependent on thedisconnection of the nonwetting (gas) phase. For surfaces having a contactangle (to an aqueous phase) greater than 70 degrees, snap-off cannot occur. Thedependence of snap-off on the water-wet nature of the pore surface and thepremise that foam generation's primary mechanism is snap-off leads naturally tothe question of what happens if a reservoir is mixed-wet or oil-wet. Reservoirrock wettability states are inherently difficult to ascertain. Hence, theprecise wetted state of most reservoirs is largely unknown. The possibility andmechanisms of the formation of mixed-wettability reservoirs have been describedin detail. Reliance of foam models on the assumption of a strongly water-wetsystem and the potential of foam as an EOR process in a wide variety ofreservoirs have prompted this laboratory investigation of foam flow through anoil-wet porous medium. A careful comparison of foam behavior in oil-wet andwater-wet systems in the absence of oil and the effects of residual oil on foamformation and stability are presented. Aspects of Foam in Oil-Wet Porous Media Bond and Bernard first tested foam in a hydrophobic porous medium. Theyobserved that, at low surfactant concentration, the hydrophobic sand was morepermeable to gas than the water-wet sand. At larger surfactant concentrations,this trend was reversed. No satisfactory interpretation of the mechanism offoam formation in this hydrophobic porous medium was presented. Kanda andSchechter subsequently treated glass beads with silicone and observed thatinitial permeability reduction of the gas was much less than that obtained withnoncoated glass beads. They asserted that soap films bridging pore walls wereunstable because of the \"poor wettability.\" More recently, Lescure andClaridge described macroscopic CO2 flood performance as a function of rockwettability. Their conclusions pointed out that foam in both oil-wet andwater-wet media significantly enhanced oil recovery compared with that of atypical water-alternating-gas process. Unfortunately, because of the integralnature of the oil recovery curves presented, fundamental interpretation oftheir data is difficult. Evidence of foam formation in oil-wet porous media inapparent contradiction of theory, which rests on a continuous water-wetnetwork, also helped to prompt this investigation. As will be shown, foam formsin a hydrophobic porous medium as a result of wettability alteration of thesurface to a hydrophilic state. "

Generally, medical computed tomography (CT) scanners have been employed because of their availability and ease of use.

Recently developed high resolution computed microtomography (CMT) using synchrotron radiation x-ray sources is analogous to conventional medical CT scanning and provides the ability to obtain three dimensional characterization of specimens with a spatial resolution on the order of microns. Application of this technique to the study of core samples provides excellent two and three dimensional high resolution description of pore structure and mineral distributions. Statistical and variogram analysis of the microtomographic images provide descriptors characteristic of the specific core material. Pore space inter-connectivity is accurately characterized and visualized. Pore level endpoint saturation microtomograms obtained during a core flood of a sandstone sample are presented. Introduction Computed x-ray tomography is often utilized to evaluate and characterize structural characteristics within reservoir core material systems. Generally, medical computed tomography (CT) scanners have been employed because of their availability and relative ease of use. Applications include core screening and characterization of inhomogeneities and damage in reservoir core samples, as well as characterization of fluid distributions within core material systems. Additionally, efforts to quantity and improve the accuracy of CT scanning techniques have been successful. Of interest lately has been the acquisition of three-dimensional, high resolution descriptions of rock structure and pore level characterization for the modeling of multiphase transport processes. Medical CT scanners are general1y limited to no better than .25 by .25 by 1.5 mm3 in volume resolution and therefore cannot provide information sufficient to define the three-dimensional pore structure of reservoir rock. Although two-dimensional pore structure is easily imaged with scanning electron microscopes (SEM), there is some question as to the destructive nature of the sampling method and extension of the two-dimensional data to three dimensions. Nuclear magnetic resource (NMR) imaging provides three-dimensional information with a resolution exceeding that of medical CT scanners. Resolution in state-of-the-art NMR microimaging is on the order of fifteen micrometers. NMR imaging however, provides information only about the fluids contained within the rock: information about the rock itself is inferred, not directly measured. Recently developed computed microtomography (CMT) offers unique imaging capabilities, compared with conventional optical and electron microscopes or NMR imaging. CMT is analogous to medical x-ray absorption CT scanning and produces images with a much higher spatial resolution. Synchrotron x rays, generated in a storage ring for relativistic electrons, are often employed for microtomography. With synchrotron x-ray CMT, three-dimensional maps of linear x-ray attenuation coefficients inside small samples can be obtained with about 1% accuracy and resolution approaching 1 m. Synchrotron x rays have been used to generate microtomograms of biological samples, thermal spray coatings, coal and heterogeneous catalysts. Recently, there has been interest in using synchrotron x-ray CMT for characterization of porous media for geological applications. "

In the initial studies using dodecane, the ionic strength and pH of the bulk aqueous phase were altered to quantitatively determine the effects on film thickness and stability. Comparison of these results with calculations from DLVO theory provided an indication that electrostatic forces played the dominant role in the stabilisation of thin aqueous films. The experimental techniques were applied to study several oils approaching a quartz surface in salt solutions. In these studies, film collapse was facilitated by inclusion of asphaltene material into the hydrocarbon. This was suggested to be due to adsorption of asphaltene at the oil/water interface altering the surface potential. In the simple hydrocarbon systems, the transition of a thin film to an optically black film did not imply a change in the wettability condition, as drops could be detached cleanly from the quartz substrate to leave a water-wet surface. When asphaltene was present in the oil phase, film collapse was accompanied by apparent wettability alteration. Irrespective of reversibility considerations, film collapse was observed to produce a heterogeneous surface of brine and oil-contacted domains on the quartz surface. "

In simulations, captive drops were forced to propagate down straight tubes to observe dynamic contact angles. Captive drops were also propagated down sinusoidally constricted capillaries in simulations to observe dynamic contact angles in convergent–divergent systems. Rate effects on observed contact angle were also probed. Negligible hysteresis or rate effect was observed over the conditions examined, indicating that the phenomenon of contact angle hysteresis is not a result of hydrodynamic interactions with an equilibrium wetting condition. It is conjectured that the time scale for solid–fluid interaction is too short in the current lattice Boltzmann scheme in comparison with that for hydrodynamic interaction.

The research groups involved are TNO, Delft University of Technology and the University of Tulsa. The various experimental setups that are used and their outcome (trends and correlations) are described. In each project, a model was developed to predict the pressure gradient under foam flowing conditions. These models are discussed here and they are applied to representative well conditions. INTRODUCTION Liquid loading is a well-known problem that occurs when wet gas wells approach their end-of-life. Due to the depletion of the reservoir, its pressure decreases. Consequently, the gas flow rate in the well is also reduced. When only dry gas is present in the well, the reduced gas flow rate has no further effect. However, when a liquid phase is present (condensate and/or water) the reduced gas flow rate may, at some point, no longer be effective in transporting the liquids to the well head and they will accumulate downhole; this is the so-called liquid loading or liquification. The critical gas velocity, Ucrit, where the pressure gradient is minimized with respect to the gas flow, is often used to determine the onset of liquid loading. "

However, as the reservoir pressure declines, the gas-production rate also declines. Eventually, the gas well starts experiencing liquid loading. Liquid loading starts when the current gas rate is incapable of lifting the liquid up to the surface. The liquid can be either water produced from the formation or the condensate. Several correlations in the literature predict the onset of liquid loading. The most famous equation, the Turner et al. (1969) equation, has many limitations, including the inability to account for effects such as diameter of the pipe and inclination angle of well, and incorrect physical assumptions regarding the onset of liquid loading. Belfroid et al. (2008) modified the Turner et al. (1969) equation for inclined wells; however, their expression is also dependent on incorrect physical assumptions and does not account for the diameter of the pipe. Another method, proposed by Shu et al. (2014), uses the correct physical assumption of liquid loading, but is overly conservative. This paper discusses a new modification to the original method proposed by Barnea (1986), which overcomes many limitations of the previous models. The new method is dependent on an assumption that liquid loading initiates when the liquid film starts falling backward. The proposed method accounts for the effect of diameter and inclination angle of the gas well. The method predicts the onset of liquid loading for a wide range of inclination angles, from vertical well to nearly horizontal well. The application of the method has been verified by comparing the results with both laboratory and field data. The method is observed to be better at predicting the onset of liquid loading compared with the other existing models in the literature. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the implementation of a novel approach for efficient well placement design based on the dynamic characteristic of the reservoir without the need to run flow simulation. The approach uses State-of-the-Art Technology called the Fast Marching Method (FMM) coupled with Geometric Pressure Approximation to define a Dynamic Reservoir Quality Map. This map is also referred to as the Depletion Capacity (DC) Map. It provides the mapping of future potential locations to further deplete the reservoir. The DC Map is generated by calculating 4 important factors, namely Pore Volume, Mobility of the Hydrocarbon, Reservoir Energy, and the Undrained Volume of the reservoir. The major breakthrough in using this technology is the ability to estimate the pressure distribution (i.e., reservoir energy) and drainage volume (i.e., to estimate the undrained volume) efficiently. These are the 2 factors that are difficult to obtain without conducting traditional flow simulation. The two aforementioned factors were obtained by calculating the FMM diffusive time of flight which can be related to the pressure drop by the Geometric Pressure Approximation theory. Thus, in effect, this calculation represents a pseudo-simulation, which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulation. The technique is applicable for both fine scale and coarse scale models with large number of realizations representing geological uncertainties. This approach works well in capturing the primary depletion phenomenon. In this paper, we demonstrate the evaluation of existing well placement of an actual developed field, with 16 wells, located in Tarim Basin, West China, by comparing it to a new design. Additionally, the method is also used to propose future locations for infill drilling. The study is motivated by the big challenges faced when drilling a well at a depth between 6800 m–8000 m. Optimum well placement has the potential to drill optimum number of wells to produce the same reserves. The new design was created with a scenario where 5 exploration wells that been put into production for a couple of years to represent the early depleted condition. The results show the optimum design can be achieved with only 12 wells. A saving of 4 wells compared to the existing well pattern. This is a significant saving considering the drilling challenges. For the infill drilling, the study shows that for this reservoir, adding more wells may not be beneficial from the ultimate recovery point of view but production can be accelerated by drilling up to 2 more wells at the best potential locations as suggested by the DC Map. Best of all, the proposed method optimizes the locations very quickly. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a static model for a naturally-fractured High-Pressure-High-Temperature (HPHT) gas sand reservoir located in the Tarim basin, Western China. The study is part of a well placement optimization study. It is motivated by the big challenges of drilling a well at depths ranging from 6800m-8000m[AG1] in a HPHT environment. A detailed fine-scale model is required as input for the dynamic model. The static model is developed through an integration [AG2]process. It consists of both matrix and fractures. The matrix modeling started by integrating 3D seismic and log data to build the structural model. A new rock type scheme was developed by reconciling log and core data, including capillary pressures. Additionally, permeabilities are estimated at each uncored location using a two-step approach, namely trend estimation by regression analysis and variability simulation by 1D Gaussian simulation. The 3D modeling was executed in the order of least dependent to most dependent variable (i.e., from facies, to rock type, then followed by porosity, permeability and saturation respectively). From the geology, the sand bodies were interpreted to be continuous throughout the field. Discontinuous mudstone layers are sandwiched in-between the sand bodies. This information, together with outcrop data, is used to guide the spatial relationships in the model. Facies, rock type, porosity and permeability are simulated using geostatistical procedures. Meanwhile, saturation is generated based on the Leverett J-Function. To quantify the uncertainty in the various data, especially in the capillary pressure data, the porosity-permeability relationship, the gas-water contact and the surface tension of the gas-water system, a probabilistic model of the Gas Initially in Place (GIP) is created through uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The origin of the fracture system was analyzed by developing a prototype of a conceptual model. The understanding from the prototype model is coupled with the 3D seismic, outcrops, drilling information, rock mechanics, image log, core, and dynamic data, to develop fracture characteristics and correlations. The discrete fracture system is modelled using a stochastic simulation approach, constraining it to the seismically-inverted fracture density map for each zone through well-seismic correlations and a nonlinear inversion [AG3]to build the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN). Finally, the fracture model is integrated with the matrix model by upscaling the DFN model into the grid system. Following the creation of the static model, a dual porosity model was prepared for dynamic modeling by maintaining consistency between the fine scale and upscaled models throughout the upscaling process. The methodology described above has produced a detailed fine scale model that shows consistency between properties and geology. This is a direct consequence of the new rock type system and the order in which the simulation was conducted. The facies model shows the continuity of the sand bodies, and the discontinuity of the mudstone, as indicated by the geological interpretation. The 3D Poro-Perm relationship shows the variability which is a reflection of the variability of the core data. The probabilistic distribution of the GIP is in agreement with the results of conventional reservoir engineering analyses, namely Material Balance and Rate Transient Analysis. Furthermore, the fracture distribution confirms the information both at the wells, as well as in-between the wells as given by the seismic interpretation. This study demonstrates that a reliable fine scale model can be developed to match the available data and interpretation by properly preparing the pre-requisite inputs and following the order of dependency in the reservoir attributes.

                    "abstract": "Primary geological model of reservoirs provided by geo-modeler usually contains complex structures and millions of grid cells. Despite the recent advances in computational resources, these highly detailed models are not suitable for flow simulation purposes due to enormous simulation costs. Upscaling is necessary to reduce the number of grid blocks in geological model while preserving the static and the dynamic properties of the fine grid model. Upscaling is dependent on the flow process and it is often difficult to ensure that all the fine scale details are preserved in the upscaling process. This adds to another level of uncertainty in dynamic performance. Since so much effort has been put in constructing the detailed geological model, it is often desirable that the simulation be carried out in the fine scale model. This work proposes a new strategy regarding the simulation of fine grid models using a single well modeling concept. The proposed method is currently suited for primary depletion process. The approach is relatively straight forward. We first identify the drainage Volume associated with each well using Fast Marching method. Fast Marching Method is extremely fast and can determine the drainage volume in large geological model within minutes. We then assume that the drainage volume does not change significantly over the life of the well. We then model each well separately as an independent well within a drainage volume and predict the performance of the well. Because the simulation model size is significantly reduced, the well performance can be predicted very quickly and is amenable to parallel simulations. By adding individual well performances, we can then combine performance to predict the field performance. This method is also suitable for history matching since by observing the drainage volumes of individual wells, we can reasonably determine if the model is suitable for history matching before the history matching process starts. We have tested the methodology for both the synthetic and the field cases and we have observed that the method works well while significantly reducing the computational costs. "

                    "abstract": "Foam lift is one of the most cost effective methodologies for unloading gas wells. The surfactants are either injected intermittently or continuously to lift the liquid to the surface. By reducing the gravitational gradient and increasing the frictional gradient, the critical velocity at which liquid loading occurs is shifted to lower gas velocities. Currently, we do not have a methodology to predict the critical velocity (at the transition boundary of annular and intermittent flow) and the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. To address this, we measured several foam flow characteristics in both small scale and large scale facilities. Small scale facility involved measurement of foam carryover capacity as a function of time and surfactant concentration. Large scale facility involved measurement of liquid holdup, pressure drop, fraction of gas trapped in foam and foam holdup in 40-ft 2-in. and 4-in. tubing. We developed closure relationships for liquid hold up, foam holdup, fraction of gas trapped in the foam and interfacial friction factor by combining the small scale data with the data collected in the large scale experiments. These closure relationships are applicable to four different surfactants tested. A new transition criterion was developed and successfully used to predict onset of liquid loading under foam flow. Using a force balance over the gas core in annular flow, we developed a new procedure to calculate the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. We compared our model results with actual measurements in the large scale facility. Our model was reasonably able to predict the pressure drop within ±30%. The reason for such a large variance is that the small scale facility was not able to capture all the characteristics of the foam which were observed in the large scale facility. It is very difficult to reproduce the foam characteristics exactly in two different experiments. This is discussed further in this paper. The procedure developed is the only one currently available to calculate the pressure drop under the foam flow conditions using the small scale data. It is superior to conventional annular flow pressure drop prediction models which are currently available in the literature. "

Liquid loading results in premature abandonment of a gas well as the liquid accumulates at the bottom of the well. With the proliferation of horizontal wells producing from gas reservoirs, it is not only important to predict the liquid loading in these wells but also the vertical location where the liquid loading is initiated. The proposed methodology predicts the liquid loading in inclined wells and also the location where it is initiated.

Currently, no methodology exists to predict the onset of liquid loading and the pressure drop in vertical gas wells under foam flow conditions. To address this, we measured several foam flow characteristics in both bench top and large scale facilities using Anionic, two Amphoteric, Sulphonate and Cationic surfactants. We used the bench top facility to measure foam carryover capacity as a function of time and surfactant concentration. We used the large scale facility to measure liquid holdup, pressure drop, fraction of gas trapped in foam and foam holdup in 40 feet 2-inch and 4-inch tubing. We developed closure relationships for liquid hold up, foam holdup, fraction of gas trapped in the foam and interfacial friction factor under foam flow by combining the bench top data with the data collected in the large scale experiments.

Using a force balance over the gas core in annular flow, we developed a new procedure to calculate the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. In a different paper, our own experimental data was compared with our model and the results are satisfactory. In this study, these models were used to predict the onset of liquid loading and the pressure drop in seventeen vertical gas wells under surfactant application without plunger lift application. The wells considered have varying surfactant injection rates, daily gas rate, daily tubing and casing pressures. While there is no field data to compare the predicted critical velocity under foam flow, the predicted critical velocity under foam flow performed favorably when compared with experimentally observed critical velocity. Our pressure drop model was able to predict the field pressure drop within reasonable limits by application of appropriate scaling factor which is explained in this study.

                    "abstract": "Most gas wells produce some amount of liquid. The liquid is either condensate or water. At high rates, the gas is able to entrain liquid to the surface; however, as gas well depletes, the liquid drops back in a gas well (called liquid loading) creating a back pressure on the reservoir formation. Addition of surfactants to the well to remove liquid is one of the common methods used in gas wells. Liquid loading in vertical gas wells with and without surfactant application was investigated in this study. Anionic, two types of amphoteric (amphoteric I and amphoteric II), sulphonate and cationic surfactants were tested in 2-inch and 4-inch 40-feet vertical pipes. Pressure gradient and liquid holdup are measured. Visual observation with a high speed camera was used to gain insight into the direction of foam flow in intermittent flow and foam film flow under annular flow conditions. Liquid loading is initiated when the liquid film attached to the wall in annular flow starts flowing downwards. Introduction of foam causes the gas velocity at which film reversal occurs to decrease; this shift increases with increasing surfactant concentration and it is more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. That is, the benefit of surfactants is much more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. The reason for postponement of liquid loading is reduction in the liquid holdup at low gas velocities which reduces the liquid holdup in foam flow compared to air-water flow. However, at higher gas velocities, the pressure drop in 2-inch compared to 4-inch pipe increases rapidly as the surfactant concentration increases. The selection of optimum concentration of the surfactant is a balance between the reductions in the gas velocity at which liquid loading occurs compared to increase in the frictional loss as the concentration increases. We provide guidelines about the selection of the surfactant concentration. Visual observations using high speed camera show differences in the behavior under foam flow conditions. Unlike air-water flow, the liquid film attached to the wall is replaced by thick foam capturing the gas bubbles. The type of roll waves which carry the liquid in 2-inch pipe is different than what was observed in 4-inch pipe. Compared to 4-inch pipe, the roll waves in 2-inch pipe are much thicker. This partly explains the differences in 2-inch versus 4-inch pipe behavior. "

                    "abstract": "One of the great challenges in reservoir modeling is to understand and quantify the dynamic uncertainties in geocellular models. Uncertainties in static parameters are easy to identify in geocellular models. Unfortunately, those models contain at least one to two orders of magnitude more gridblocks than typical simulation models. This means that, without significant upscaling, the dynamic uncertainties in these models cannot easily be assessed. Further, if we would like to select only a few geological models that can be carried forward for future performance predictions, we do not have an objective method of selecting the models that can properly capture the dynamic-uncertainty range. One possible solution is to use a faster simulation technique, such as streamline simulation. However, even streamline simulation requires solving a pressure equation at least once. For highly heterogeneous reservoir models with multimillion cells and in the presence of capillary effect or expansion-dominated process, this can pose a challenge. If we use static permeability thresholds to determine the connected volume, it would not account for how tortuous the connection is between the connected gridblock and the well location. In this paper, we use the fast-marching method (FMM) as a computationally efficient method for calculating the pressure/front propagation time on the basis of reservoir properties. This method is based on solving an Eikonal equation by use of upwind finite-difference approximation. In this method, pressure/front location (radius of investigation) can be calculated as a function of time without running any flow simulation. We demonstrate that dynamically connected volume based on pressure-propagation time is a very good proxy for ultimate recovery from a well in the primary-depletion process. With a predetermined threshold propagation time, a large number of geocellular models can be ranked. FMM can be scaled almost linearly with the number of gridblocks in the model. Two main advantages of this ranking method compared with other methods are that this method determines dynamic connectivity in the reservoir and that it is computationally much more efficient. We demonstrate the validity of the method by comparing ranking of multiple geocellular realizations (on Cartesian grid with heterogeneous and anisotropic permeability) by use of FMM with ranking from flow simulation. This method will allow us to select the geological models that can truly capture the range of dynamic uncertainty very efficiently. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading, which can lead to rapid gas-rate decline and can even cease gas production, is a common phenomenon found in most mature gas wells. An accurate prediction of the inception of liquid loading is of great interest to operators, for the reason that remedial measures can be applied in a timely manner to prevent such conditions from being realized, thereby extending the production life of a gas well. However, the mechanism that is responsible for liquid loading still remains controversial. In the literature, at least three different definitions of liquid loading exist. The first definition is based on the intersection of inflow and outflow curves, the second definition is based on the reversal of entrained liquid droplets, and the third definition is based on the reversal of liquid film. These definitions yield different results when predicting the inception of liquid loading. In this paper, a new definition of liquid loading is introduced. This new definition is based on the relative contributions of gravity and residual pressure drop, and it is validated by its agreement with air/water experimental data. A new comprehensive model is developed that is based on the Barnea (1986, 1987) model. For vertical wells, the new model can better predict the inception of liquid loading than the widely used Turner et al. (1969) equation. For deviated wells, it is observed in the field and in laboratories that liquid loading starts much earlier than in vertical wells, and most liquid-loading equations are not appropriate for deviated wells. The new model takes into account the nonuniform film thickness around the circumferential position of the pipe, and, thus, it improves the prediction of liquid loading in deviated wells. The new model is validated through the use of field data in the literature and experimental data obtained at the University of Tulsa. In addition to the literature data, a new set of field data is reported and used to validate the new model, which shows a significant improvement over the droplet model as well as other film models.

                    "abstract": "With increasing computational power, large geo-cellular models are constructed comprising of multi-million cells. Using uncertainty work flows, large number of geo-cellular models (realizations and scenarios) are constructed which can incorporate uncertainties in static parameters. The typical number of geo-cellular models can range between as few as thirty to as high as hundreds or even thousands.  Once these models are constructed, the geo-modeler as well as simulation engineer realizes that all these models cannot be flow simulated without significant upscaling. Therefore, a search begins to find a method which would cost effectively select just a few of these geo-cellular models which can bracket the uncertainties present in these models. Static methodologies, which rank these realizations based on static properties such as Hydrocarbon Pore Volume (HPV) or STOIIP/GIP may not truly represent the ranking based on actual performance of the reservoirs.  For example, a reservoir which contains large HPV but is not well connected will ultimately produce less oil/gas than a reservoir which is well connected but contains less HPV. We, therefore, need a ranking based on dynamic characterization of the reservoir. We have developed methodology based on Eikonal equation which can rank multiple realizations extremely efficiently.  The method determines the time  it takes for a traveling of a pressure “wave” to reach a particular grid block from a given well and assumes that time it takes to “tag” a grid block will reflect how quickly that grid block can be drained from a given well.  Unlike finite difference or streamline simulation, the method does not require solving any matrix; hence, it is unconditionally stable.  In matter of few minutes, a geo-cellular model containing more than fifty million cells can be interrogated. Using both synthetic and field examples, we demonstrate that the ranking based on our methodology is consistent with the ranking one would obtain using finite difference simulator.  Further, ranking based on static properties does not correlate well with the dynamic response of the reservoir.  By using the proposed methodology, limited number of geo-cellular realizations can be selected which can capture true dynamic uncertainty in reservoir performance. Introduction The standard operating procedure for conducting modern reservoir modeling consists of steps of building a detail base case containing multi-million cells static model followed by uncertainty analysis. The analysis includes various uncertain variables that may originate from geophysical, geological, petrophysical and engineering disciplines. The combination of these uncertain variables will generate hundreds or even thousands of models through random realizations and/or scenarios. "

Since the main goal is to preserve the dynamic behavior, the reservoir parameters, which have an impact on dynamic behavior, should be properly calibrated before upgridding. This includes the type of flow process that is under consideration as well as crossflow across the geological layers. In this paper, we examined the effect of mobility ratio in the presence and absence of crossflow under water flooding conditions. We observed that in the case of favorable mobility ratio and crossflow condition, the upgridding error (difference between fine and coarse layer models production) is small and many more layers could be combined without deviating from the fine-scale model result. In contrast, for unfavorable mobility ratio displacements, crossflow does not help homogenize heterogeneous layers. The upgridding error increases very rapidly as the layers are combined. This implies that we need to maintain a much higher level of detail from the fine-scale model if we want to retain the dynamic behavior. "

The understanding of phase and fluid flow-behavior relationships is essential if we want to make accurate engineering computations for gas-condensate systems. Condensate dropout occurs in the reservoir as the pressure falls below the dewpoint, resulting in significant gas-phase production decreases. The goal of this study is to understand the multiphase-flow behavior in gas-condensate reservoirs and, in particular, to focus on estimating gas-condensate-well deliverability. Our new method analytically generates the inflow-performance-relationship (IPR) curves of gas-condensate wells by incorporating the effect of condensate banking as the pressure near the wellbore drops below the dewpoint. The only information needed to generate the IPR is the rock relative permeability data and a constant-composition expansion (CCE) experiment. We have developed a concept of critical oil saturation near the wellbore by simulating both lean and rich condensate reservoirs and have observed that the loss in productivity caused by condensate accumulation can be closely tied to critical saturation. We are able to reasonably estimate re-evaporation of liquid accumulation by knowing the CCE data. We validated our new method by comparing our analytical results with fine-scale-radial-simulation-model results. We demonstrated that our analytical tool can predict the IPR curve as a function of reservoir pressure. We also developed a method for generating an IPR curve with field data and demonstrated its application with field data. The method is easy to use and can be implemented quickly. Another advantage of this method is that it does not require the knowledge of accurate production data including the varying condensate/gas ratio (CGR). "

                    "abstract": "Despite computational advances, geo-cellular models are routinely upscaled for reservoir simulation purposes. Geo-cellular models typically incorporate small scale variations obtained from static data; whereas, simulation models capture dynamic data obtained from production of the field. The process of reducing the number of grid blocks in the geological model so that the simulation model can be run efficiently is called the process of upscaling. Upscaling requires combining the small grid blocks from geological model to make a larger grid block, as well as assigning reservoir properties on the coarse scale. Among the physical properties that need to be assigned, the assignment of permeability is the most challenging. Unlike porosity (or saturation), permeability is a dynamic property and capturing the fine scale dynamic displacement requires a non-linear upscaling of fine scale permeability values. The two types of methods used for permeability upscaling can be broadly categorized as static upscaling and dynamic upscaling. Static upscaling methods average fine scale values to calculate an upscaled value. These methods are efficient but may not capture the dynamic behavior. The dynamic upscaling methods are computationally expensive and may be dependent on boundary conditions. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic method for areal upscaling based on the fast marching algorithm. The Fast Marching Method (FMM) accurately captures the propagating pressure front as a function of time. We define the objective function as the difference in the propagation time between fine scale and coarse scale models. By minimizing the objective function, we calculate the permeability of the upscaled model. The Fast Marching Method is an extremely efficient method for calculating the pressure front propagation time based on reservoir properties. This method is based on solving the Eikonal equation using an upwind finite difference approximation. The advantage of this method is that, without running any flow simulation, we can calculate the pressure front location (radius of investigation) as a function of time. In this paper, using 2D and 3D models, we demonstrate that the calculated effective permeability using the new method can reproduce the dynamic behavior of the fine scale model. "

                    "abstract": "Many tight gas reservoirs are characterized by large gross interval with significant presence of shale and interspersed sand. The geo-cellular models of these reservoirs, which honor the resolution of log data, contain large number of layers. Without significant upgridding of vertical layers, flow simulation of such reservoirs is very difficult. Ideally, the upgridding process should be conducted such that the dynamic performance of geo-cellular model is preserved in the upgridded model. One way to ensure efficient upgridding is to preserve fine scale pressure profile in the coarse scale model. In this study we observed that, in heterogeneous reservoirs, the vertical communication across layers has a big impact on the flow behavior in a fine scale model. In the presence of vertical communication, fine scale heterogeneities are homogenized. That is, layers with different permeabilities have similar pressure profiles during the depletion phase. Hence by combining these layers into a single layer would still predict a similar dynamic performance. In contrast, when crossflow across layers does not exist, combining those layers would result in much different dynamic behavior than fine scale behavior. It was observed that upgridding performance is not only influenced by the extent of sand connectivity across the layers (which tells us about vertical communication) but also how areally dispersed the connections are present. In the case of existence of dispersed shale within reservoir it was found that the vertical flow is more helped by smaller sized vertical connections between layers, which are areally dispersed, than large sized connections concentrated within a certain region. Analytical solution is provided to quantitatively prove the effect of size as well as dispersed nature of connection across the layers. Using the underpinnings of analytical solution, a new methodology is developed which combines layers based on sand connectivity (vertical permeability) across adjacent layers as well as their respective petrophysical properties (horizontal permeability). Our approach is analytical. However, it was shown that the analytical upgridding error we estimate closely mirrors the simulation error which represents the difference in the dynamic performance of fine versus coarse layers. We validate our method by applying it to both synthetic as well as field cases. Through these examples, we demonstrate that newly proposed method is superior to proportional as well as variance and flux based upgridding methods. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Due to advances in computer technology, geo-scientists are increasingly able to build reservoir models which can incorporate significant geological details. It is not unusual to find geological models which contain millions of cells. Flow simulating such models is still a challenge as running a typical simulation model takes two orders of magnitude more time than generating a geological model. Upgridding the geological model to reduce the number of grid blocks while maintaining the essential heterogeneity details to preserve the dynamic performance is the only solution to this problem.  In the literature, many solutions are proposed to upgrid the geological model. The simple static solutions involve combining layers with similar static properties so that the heterogeneous details are preserved. In our paper, we take the method one step further. It has been observed in the past that upgridding should be dependent on the flow process. That is, the way the layers are combined would be different for depletion drive compared to water flooding. The displacement of fluids is strongly dependent on the type of drive; hence, rearrangement of the fine scale layers has to be different to capture this behavior.  In our approach, we propose a method of upgridding which can be applied for either secondary or tertiary recovery processes. Our method is analytical and is based on an idea that fractional flow of a fine scale model has to be preserved on a coarse scale. We use fractional flow on a fine scale model and define our error as the difference between fractional flows of a coarse scale vs. fine scale. We combine layers which minimizes this difference. Using our procedure, we demonstrate that for favorable mobility ratio, it is better that we isolate low permeability layers; whereas, for adverse mobility ratio, we need to isolate high permeability layers. Using both synthetic and field cases, we demonstrate that our proposed method provides superior upgridding compared to other methods currently available in the literature.  Introduction Conducting accurate and computationally efficient simulation of a reservoir model is the first priority of any simulation engineer. Over the last decade, the development of detailed three dimensional geologic descriptions has become common-place within asset and project teams worldwide. As the computational speed has improved, both geo-cellular and simulation models have become bigger. However computational requirements for geo-cellular models are always smaller than that of the corresponding flow simulation models. It is lot easier to build multi-million cell geo-cellular models but very difficult to flow simulate them. A typical reservoir simulator can handle 106 to 107 grid blocks. The number of grid blocks is a function of the production mechanism, heterogeneity of the reservoir and even post-processing of the simulation data for history matching purposes, whereas the number of geological models grid blocks is typically function of static resolution of the data. The key to upscaling the geological model is to retain sufficient amount of heterogeneities in the model so that the dynamic performance (production profile) of the fine scale model is captured. "

Understanding of phase and fluid flow behavior relationships is essential if we want to make accurate engineering computations for gas condensate systems.

The goal of this study is to understand the multiphase flow behavior in gas condensate reservoirs and, in particular, focusing on estimating gas condensate well deliverability. Our new method analytically generates inflow performance relationship (IPR) curves of gas condensate wells by incorporating the effect of condensate banking as the pressure near the wellbore drops below the dew point. The only information needed to generate the IPR is the rock relative permeability data and Constant Composition Expansion (CCE) experiment. We have developed a concept of critical oil saturation near the wellbore by simulating both lean and rich condensate reservoirs and observed that the loss in productivity due to condensate accumulation can be closely tied to critical saturation. We are able to reasonably estimate re-evaporation of liquid accumulation by knowing the CCE data. We validated our new method by comparing our analytical results with fine scale radial simulation model results. We demonstrated that our analytical tool can predict the IPR curve as a function of reservoir pressure. We also developed a method for generating an IPR curve by using field data and demonstrated its application by using field data. The method is easy to use and can be implemented quickly. Introduction Well productivity is an important issue in the development of most low and medium permeability gas condensate reservoirs. Liquid buildup around the well can cause a significant reduction in productivity, even in lean gas condensate reservoirs where the maximum liquid drop out in the Constant Composition Expansion (CCE) experiment is as low as 1% (Afidick et al., 1994). Subsequently, accurate forecasts of productivity can be difficult because of the need to understand and account for the complex processes that occur in the near-well region. The production performance of a gas condensate well is easy to predict (similar to a dry gas well) as long as the well's flowing bottom-hole pressure (FBHP) is above the fluid dew point pressure. Once the well's FBHP falls below the dew point, the well performance starts to deviate from that of a dry gas well. Condensate begins to drop out first near the wellbore. Immobile initially, liquid condensate accumulates until the critical condensate saturation (the minimum mobile condensate saturation) is reached. This rich liquid zone grows outward deeper into the reservoir as depletion continues (Fevang and Whiston, 1995). The loss in productivity due to liquid build up is mostly influenced by the value of gas relative permeability (krg) near the well when compared with the value of krg in the reservoir further away. The loss in productivity is more sensitive to the relative permeability curves than to fluid pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties (Mott, 1997). The most accurate way to calculate gas condensate well productivity is by fine-grid numerical simulation, either in single well models with a fine grid near the well or in full-field models using local grid refinement. A large part of the pressure drawdown occurs within 10 ft of the well, so that radial models are needed with the inner grid cell having dimensions of about one foot (Mott, 2003: Xiao and Al-Muraikhi, 2004). Several investigators have estimated the productivity of gas condensate reservoirs, but none of these methods are simple to use. Some methods require use of the modification of a finite difference simulation process; whereas, other methods use simplified simulation models (Xiao Al-Muraikhi, 2004; Guehria, 2000). Our objective is to develop a simple yet accurate analytical procedure to estimate the productivity of gas condensate reservoirs without having to run simulations. The only required data to use in our method is the CCE and relative permeability curves. As with other simplified methods, our new technique allows well performance evaluation quickly without reservoir simulations. A fine grid radial compositional model was built in a commercial flow simulator to validate the results of our analytical approach. "

                    "title": "Interference Study in Shale Plays",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Advances in drilling and fracturing technologies in Woodford Shale have attracted the operators to drill horizontal wells with long laterals (up to 5,000 ft), and to fracture using multiple stages (up to 22) using large amounts of slickwater and sand. It has been observed that exploitation of shale plays relies on the ability to contact as much of the reservoir as possible using fracturing techniques by creating a network of interconnecting fractures between laterals placed as close as 660 ft apart. As the spacing gets closer, the operators have a vested interest in knowing the optimal spacing of infill wells. Ideally, an infill well should have as little interference with the existing wells as possible.  In this paper, we examine fracture data, and daily gas and water production data of 179 horizontal gas wells over five years in the Arkoma Basin to quantify the impact of interference between wells on their performance. We quantify the lost gas production from the surrounding wells; calculate the probability of interference as a function of distance and age of the surrounding well; determine the preferential direction of interference, and develop a new measure of spacing to understand the relationship between performance of the well and its surrounding wells. Finally, we provide recommendations regarding the spacing of infill wells.  Introduction The late Devonian to early Mississippian age Woodford Shale extends from Southern Kansas, through Oklahoma into West Texas. It is 50-300 ft thick, easily identified by a high gamma ray streak (>150 API units) and it lies between 6,000 to 12,000 ft in depth. Unusually high concentrations of total organic content (TOC) characterize the Woodford Shale as one of the richest hydrocarbon content source beds in the United States. In the Woodford Shale, TOC typically varies from about 3 to 28%.1 From January 2000 through April 2009, the Woodford Shale produced over 350 billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG) from approximately 800 horizontal wells.1 Most of them were completed in the Arkoma Basin of Southeast Oklahoma. Average production per well is approximately 700 MCFD with initial rates as high as 5-11 MMSCFD.1 Wells are typically drilled using oil based mud close to the centre of the formation.1 Figure 1 show a map of Oklahoma with the Woodford Shale in the Arkoma Basin and the major provinces in Oklahoma.  This shale play is a prolific gas reserve in the western Arkoma Basin within Atoka, Coal, Hughes and Pittsburg Counties of Oklahoma. Seismic data indicates that the maximum stress direction of the field is in the East-West direction and the ultra low permeability (1nd to 1µd) of this shale play qualifies it as an unconventional reservoir which cannot be produced at economic flow rates or that does not produce at economic volumes without assistance from massive stimulation treatments such as hydraulic fracturing. A typical core consists of: 35-50% quartz, 0-20% calcite/dolomite, 0-20% pyrite, 10-50% clay and porosity ranges from 3-9%. Water saturation varies from 30% to 45%. The formation is slightly under pressured with pressure gradients in the 0.35 to 0.44 psi/ft range.3  In a bid to optimize gas production from this shale play, horizontal wells are drilled in the direction of minimum principal stress and multiple hydraulic fractures are placed in close proximity to each other. Recent advances in hydraulic fracturing coupled with the need for production increase due to high gas prices in 2008 revitalized drilling activities from single drilling with 640 acre spacing to a pad drilling of 5 to 6 wells with inter-well spacing as low as 10 acres using lateral lengths extending as long as 5,287 ft. Hydraulic fracturing techniques such as simultaneous fracturing (\"Simul-Frac??), in which adjacent lateral sections are hydraulically fractured at the same time, have been tried to improve the performance of wells. Another technique that has been adopted includes stimulating a lateral, and before fluid flowback, stimulating adjacent laterals so as to take advantage of the pressurized rock matrix from the first stimulated lateral.4 "

Introduction Geological models are generated to capture geologic and petrophysical descriptions which are available on log or core scale. By nature, these models contain multi-million cells.  Flow simulation of these models is very inefficient.  Further, it may not be necessary to preserve the fine scale model to preserve the resolution of the dynamic data.  Defining an appropriate upgridding so that the resolution of dynamic data is preserved is a challenging process.  It also depends on the flow process.  The methods which are based on static reservoir parameters may not be able to capture a particular dynamic process.  For example, an upgridding process which captures water flood correctly may not capture the CO2 flooding process and vice a versa.  Instead of using static parameters to generate the upgridding process, our approach uses fractional flow equation which represents the dynamic process.  We concentrate on vertical resolution since vertical variability is captured through log and core data.  Reducing vertical layers so that the dynamic behavior is preserved is the most crucial aspect of upgridding.  Areal upgridding is possible, but because areal data are sparse, the methodology is arbitrary.  In our approach, we assume that we only do vertical upgridding and our areal grids in fine scale are the same as in simulation scale. Typically, upgridding process composes of two steps.  The first step is to determine the proper combinations between cells or layers based on the proposed approach.  The second step is to determine to what extent the fine scale model can be upgridded to (optimum number of the layers), so that it is still able to reproduce important flow behavior.

                    "abstract": "Once a new unconventional play is identified, companies would start acquiring sizable land holdings within the same play.   Before acquiring, the companies would like to answer several questions: how much to pay for the bonus; what is the strategy to initiate the drilling program and how to determine the uncertainty related to EUR from these wells. Most companies would use the data from existing wells within the same play or similar play to estimate what type of production to be expected from the land to be acquired.  Based on the results, they will determine the bonus as well as expected uncertainties. We approach this problem using a novel method.  We use the analog EUR data to develop the spatial relationships for the analog field.  By assuming log-normal distribution for EUR data, we build the equations for the EUR for the new area.  Appropriate scaling considerations can be included in these equations.  For example, the newly acquired area may have smaller thickness than the analog or would use longer horizontal wells.  We generate a graph of p10, p50 and p90 EUR values for the initial drilling program, starting with the first well.   Knowing the uncertainty in EUR values, the initial bonus, based on appropriate economic criteria, can be determined.  Once the land is acquired, as the initial drilling program is initiated, the method will allow the company to compare the performance of actual well with the expected uncertainty range.   Depending on the locations of the wells and spatial relationship, the uncertainty will change differently.  By using the method, the company can evaluate if the average performance of the drilled wells is within the realm of acceptable uncertainties or should the model be changed based on the new data available.  We validated the proposed method for a shale play in Oklahoma. Introduction Shale gas plays are becoming increasingly important in the U.S. and perhaps in the world.  Shale gas plays possess some unique characteristics, which is not typical for conventional gas reservoirs.  One of the relevant characteristics is the areal extent.  Unlike conventional reservoirs, whose areal extent is limited and discontinuous (e.g., fluvial channels can appear and disappear), shale plays extend over many square miles, and some times, over many states (e.g., Marcellus Shale).  Drilling a well is almost guaranteed to be successful in penetrating a particular shale formation.  This does not mean the well will be successful.  Other intrinsic parameters of the shale such as mineralogy, presence of natural fractures, brittleness, stress anisotropy can play an important role in determining the success of fracturing in the shale.  In addition, external parameters have also played an important role.  These parameters include: length of horizontal wells, number of stages of fractures, the size of the fracture at each stage, the concentration of the sand and fracturing fluid to name a few.   There are clearly areas within a particular shale which have been more successful than the others.  However, many operators believe that with the right fracturing technique and well configuration, the areas which are not successful today can become successful tomorrow.  The history confirms this belief.  Many shales (e.g., Barnett) which did not appear to be successful at the beginning, became commercially successful once the right fracturing technology was applied.

Their geologic history indicates the development of non primary drainage equilibrium. Hence, one does not observe transition zone but trendless variation in multiphase fluid saturations throughout the formation. These varying multiphase fluid saturations will affect the effective permeability available to gas and water phases. Since the flow potential of a well is directly related to effective permeability, we propose a novel upgridding method to combine grid blocks having similar effective permeabilities which will implicitly take into account upscaling of multiphase fluid saturations in these tight gas systems.  Our algorithm groups vertical layers in a way such that the heterogeneity loss of an appropriately defined static property is minimized within layers. We define this static property of a grid block as the product of its net volume, its absolute permeability and relative permeability available to a phase within that grid block. The upgridding approach is essentially a sequential coarsening algorithm that starts from a fine scale model and merges the two adjacent layers that results in a minimum heterogeneity loss of defined static property.  To determine the optimum number of up-gridded layers for efficient numerical flow simulation of these detailed geological models, we define criteria such as removal of heterogeneity from a model at a particular coarsening step and design factor which will help preserve the critical level of heterogeneity. We compare our upgridding method with proportional upgridding and traditional variance based methods for synthetic and field cases of tight gas reservoirs, and the results demonstrate that our proposed layer combinations can better capture dynamic flow behavior of the fine scale model.  Introduction Typically, geologic models are two orders of magnitude bigger than simulation models. Since they try to capture geological and petrophysical descriptions available on log or core scale, they are described in detail. But flow simulation of these models is computationally expensive. Therefore, it is imperative to upscale these geologic models from fine to a coarser scale description. The process of upscaling is composed two steps. The first step involves combination of various grid blocks of the geological model to create a simulation grid (this is called upgridding), and second step involves reassigning reservoir properties to simulation grid using various property upscaling methods. In this paper, we propose an upgridding scheme for tight gas reservoirs under multiphase fluid (gas and water) flow where sharp changes between sandstone and shale beds are also predominant.  We only concentrate on vertical upgridding in this paper and keep the areal grid same as in fine scale. Another practical point in the process of upgridding is that from a geological point of view, we should not combine layers from different zones of reservoirs. Our upgridding scheme honors this restriction. Moreover, given an optimum number of simulation layers, we upgrid all zones of a reservoir simultaneously. "

                    "abstract": "Recent advancements in surfactants for chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) are presented. For oils with a high equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN), surfactants with very large hydrophobes are needed to obtain the ultra-low interfacial tensions needed to reduce the residual oil saturation to nearly zero. The need increases at high temperature. Furthermore, these large hydrophobes need to be branched to promote formation of microemulsions with low to moderate viscosity as opposed to gels or other viscous structures that cause high surfactant retention. We show that such surfactants can be made from more than one type of hydrophobe in the form of either alkoxy sulfates or carboxylates. The carboxylates have the advantage of better stability at high temperature. Both the sulfates and carboxylates can be easily tailored to specific reservoir conditions and oils by adjusting the number of ethylene oxide (EO) or propylene oxide (PO) groups in the surfactant. A new correlation has been developed using an extensive data set taking into account the effects of PO number, EO number, temperature, brine salinity and the EACN of the oil on the optimum hydrophobe size. These new developments have enabled us to address a much wider range of conditions of oil characteristics, reservoir temperature, salinity and hardness level. Furthermore, the new surfactants are competitive in cost with previous EOR surfactants. Thus, these new developments have greatly advanced the commercial potential of chemical EOR. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The Guerbet reaction produces large, branched hydrophobes through the dimerization of linear alcohols. High-performance, low-cost enhanced oil recovery (EOR) surfactants are produced by carboxylation (carboxymethylation) of large Guerbet alkoxylates. Alkoxy groups such as propylene oxide (PO) and ethylene oxide (EO) are incorporated as extenders to the Guerbet alcohol, followed by carboxylation to make the anionic surfactant. Previously, the use of low-cost Guerbet alkoxy sulfate surfactants for EOR applications at high temperatures was established by enhancing their thermal stability when the pH is maintained at 10-11. Alternative thermally and chemically stable anionic surfactant structures are highly desired, especially for application under conditions where alkali usage is prohibitive. These novel large-hydrophobe carboxylate surfactants meet this need. In addition, the Guerbet alkoxy carboxylate structure can be tailored to fit the specific EOR requirements. These surfactants are stable at elevated temperatures both with and without alkali, and furthermore they can be used in environments of high salinity and high hardness (high concentration of divalent ions). Carboxylate surfactants have been used in formulations to produce ultra-low interfacial tensions with low microemulsion viscosities for a wide variety of crude oils under a large range of reservoir conditions. A parallel paper titled \"Novel Large-Hydrophobe Alkoxy Carboxylate Surfactants for Enhanced Oil Recovery?? will discuss the application of these surfactants. Thus, the advent of this class of cost-effective surfactants greatly broadens the application of chemical EOR.  Introduction In order to obtain ultra-low interfacial tensions and low microemulsion viscosities when the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of a crude oil is higher than about 12, surfactants with very large hydrophobes and branched structures are required (Liu et al., 2007; Adkins et al., 2010). Conditions such as high temperature and/or high salinity and hardness can make it extremely challenging to achieve these properties. Previously, it was shown that cost-effective, high-performance surfactants can be produced in the form of Guerbet alkoxy sulfate surfactants (GAES) (Adkins et al., 2010). Very large hydrophobes can be produced from smaller linear alcohols using the Guerbet reaction which dimerizes the linear alcohol using base (plus Transition Metal) catalysis at high temperatures (O'Lenick, 2001). Anionic surfactants are then produced by alkoxylation of the Guerbet alcohol with the addition of propylene oxide (PO) and ethylene oxide (EO) units, followed by sulfation which is a lower cost alternative to the more complex sulfonation process.  Traditionally, alkoxy sulfate surfactants were found to have poor hydrolytic stability at elevated temperatures (>65 °C) (Talley, 1988). However, recent investigations have shown that enhanced stability can be achieved under specific alkalinity conditions at temperatures up to 120 °C (Adkins et al., 2010). Hydrolysis of the alkoxy sulfate surfactants can occur by both a very rapid acid-catalyzed mechanism (Rosen, 2004) or a less pronounced base-catalyzed reaction mechanism. The alkalinity (pH) of the surfactant solution must be controlled in order to reduce the rates of these decomposition reactions at elevated temperatures. Optimal stability of the alkoxy sulfate surfactants occurs when the pH of the solution is maintained in the range of 10-11. If the pH of the surfactant solution is outside this range, hydrolysis of the surfactant occurs more rapidly (more so in the lower pH range) and the surfactant decomposes. Therefore, in order to stabilize the alkoxy sulfate surfactants during chemical flooding at elevated temperatures (> 65 °C), alkali (usually sodium carbonate) must be used. However there are many situations where the use of alkali is prohibitive and only thermally and chemically stable anionic surfactants can be used. "

                    "abstract": "Water floods are often very inefficient in naturally fractured carbonate oil reservoirs because many of these reservoirs are mixed-wet or oil-wet as well as extremely heterogeneous. Naturally fractured reservoirs are challenging targets for chemical flooding because they typically have a high permeability contrast between the fractures and the matrix with a low matrix permeability. Some of the world׳s largest oil reservoirs are fractured carbonates with a high reservoir temperature and a high salinity formation brine. Some of them also have low API gravity oils, which also increases the difficulty of recovering the oil. A surfactant formulation has been developed that shows promising results for such difficult reservoirs. Ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) and good aqueous stability were achieved with this new carboxylate surfactant in a hard brine at a high reservoir temperature of 100 °C. Both static and dynamic imbibition experiments were conducted using a fractured carbonate core. 65.9% Oil recovery was obtained in fractured coreflood compared to 33.3% oil recovery in static imbibition test. The surfactant retention was low at 0.086 mg/g of rock. The oil recovery is excellent taking into account that the temperature and salinity conditions were harsh, the core was extremely vuggy and fractured, no mobility control was used, and only a small surfactant slug was injected. The coreflood results were interpreted using a mechanistic chemical reservoir simulator. It showed that both the mechanisms of IFT reduction and wettability alteration were important for oil recovery. Neither IFT reduction nor wettability alteration alone recovered oil as high as the combined contributions from both. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract It is well known that the oil recovery efficiency of chemical EOR depends on microemulsion phase behavior and interfacial tension (IFT). The surfactants needed to obtain good phase behavior and ultra-low IFT vary greatly with oil characteristics and reservoir conditions. Hence, it is often necessary to test many surfactant formulations before finding a highly effective one. Based on both sound principles and extensive experience, one would expect to find a relationship between the optimum surfactant structure, the oil characteristics, the brine, and the temperature. Salager's equation (Salager et al., 1979, Anton et al., 2008) shows it is possible to correlate some of these variables to classical surfactant structure. We now have many new surfactants with widely different structures and many more good formulations with a wider range of oils, temperature and so forth. Thus, it becomes imperative to study the underlying trend and to identify the most important variables affecting the optimum surfactant structure. A new correlation has been developed using an extensive data set taking into account the effect of propylene oxide number (PON), ethylene oxide number (EON), temperature, brine salinity and the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of the oil. The new correlation will help in identifying the most important variables and also to improve our understanding of the relationship among variables affecting optimum surfactant structure. In particular, the new equation can be used to predict the optimum carbon number of the surfactant hydrophobe. Results show that larger hydrophobes are needed as either the temperature or the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) of the oil increases. The surfactant formulations used for this study include mixtures of sulfate, sulfonate, carboxylate and non-ionic surfactants. This is a new and highly significant advance in the optimization of chemical EOR processes that will greatly reduce the time and cost of the effort required to develop a good formulation as well as to improve its performance.  Background Griffin (1949) first introduced the concept of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) to quantify for the relative affinity of surfactant for water and oil. According to this empirical relation, each oil is characterized by \"required HLB?? (HLBreq), corresponding to the HLB of the surfactant resulting in the most stable emulsion. However, this method doesn't take into account the effect of other formulation variables such as salinity, hardness, temperature, alkali, alcohol (co-solvent) type and concentration and co-surfactant type and concentration. Winsor (1954) introduced the R-ratio that relates the relative energies of interaction between the surfactant adsorbed at the interface and the aqueous and oil phases surrounding it. It takes into account the molecular effects at the interface, but is still limited by the fact that energies of interaction cannot be measured experimentally. Shinoda (1964) proposed a method based on the determination of phase inversion temperature (PIT) - equivalent to cloud point phenomenon (decrease in hydrophilicity of ethylene oxide moiety of surfactants upon heating). It takes into account the effect of formulation variables (salinity, oil, additives), but in practice this technique can be applied only to ethoxylated nonionic surfactants, since ionic surfactants show opposite sensitivity to temperature.

Vertical upward surfactant displacement experiments were performed and compared with stability theory. The proposed theory and experimental results offer new insight into the behavior of surfactant floods stabilized by gravity forces. Introduction The hydrodynamic stability of both miscible and immiscible displacements in porous media has been studied for many years. Many investigators have reported both experimental and theoretical results for the effects of gravity and viscosity on the stability of miscible displacements (Hill, 1952; Perrine, 1961 and 1963; Dumore, 1964; Tan and Homsy, 1987 and 1988; Homsy, 1987; Hickernell and Yortsos, 1986; Manickam and Homsy, 1995) and immiscible displacements (Engelberts and Klinkenberg, 1951; Chuoke et al., 1959; Terwilliger et al., 1951; Sheldon et al., 1959; Fayers and Sheldon, 1959; Raghavan and Marsden, 1971; Nayfeh, 1972; Peters and Flock, 1981; Glass and Yarrington, 1996; Stephen et al., 2001; Meheust et al., 2002; Ould-Amer and Chikh, 2003; Riaz and Tchelepi, 2004). Surfactants can generate ultra-low IFT and displace almost all the residual oil after waterflooding a core (for recent experimental examples, see Yang et al., 2010; Adkins et al., 2010 and 2012; Lu et al., 2012), but even at ultra-low IFT surfactant floods are still not miscible displacements. The understanding of the gravitational stability of surfactant floods is lacking. Surfactant displacement experiments were carried out to determine the critical velocity for a gravity stable surfactant flood. "

We illustrate results for several of these new surfactants and discuss under what conditions they are suitable, how we developed formulations using them and some of the general principles that can be applied to future applications. A common theme of this development is the need for surfactants with large hydrophobes (carbon numbers above 18) even for some light oils. A second common theme is the advantages and flexibility of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide linkages between these large hydrophobes and the sulfate or carboxylate end group. A third common theme is the advantages of highly branched hydrophobes regardless of the other characteristics of the surfactant structure help prevent undesirable viscous phases.

However, stability theory for an ultra-low interfacial tension (IFT) surfactant displacement is not well developed or validated. In this paper, a method for predicting the critical velocity for a surfactant flood is proposed taking into account the microemulsion phase. Vertical upward surfactant displacement experiments were performed in sandpacks at velocities of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 ft/day. The surfactant flood at 0.2 ft/day was a nearly stable displacement whereas the floods at 0.4 and 0.8 ft/day were unstable with visually obvious fingers. The stability theory is in good agreement with experimental results. The proposed theory and experimental results offer new insight into the behavior of surfactant floods stabilized by gravity forces and in particular the importance of the microemulsion phase and its properties, especially its viscosity. It is very important to measure the microemulsion viscosity and account for its effect on the critical velocity. Furthermore, the microemulsion viscosity can be optimized to improve the velocity for a stable displacement. This insight opens up a new pathway for optimizing surfactant floods without mobility control. It is possible to design an efficient surfactant flood without any mobility control if the surfactant solution is injected at a low velocity in horizontal wells at the bottom of the geological zone and the oil captured in horizontal wells at the top of the zone. This approach is practical if the vertical permeability of the geological zone is high. Under favorable reservoir conditions, gravity-stable surfactant floods may be an attractive alternative to surfactant–polymer floods. "

Unconventional tight reservoirs can differ significantly from one another, which could make the use of these techniques effective in some cases but not in others. We present an experimental investigation dependent on a coreflood sequence that simulates fluid invasion, flowback, and hydrocarbon production from hydraulically fractured reservoirs. We compare the benefits of shut-ins and reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) by surfactants for hydrocarbon permeability for different initial reservoir conditions (IRCs). From this work, we identify the mechanism responsible for the permeability reduction in the matrix, and we suggest criteria that can be used to optimize fracturing-fluid additives and/or manage flowback operations to enhance hydrocarbon production from unconventional tight reservoirs.

Scientific understanding of how the molecular structures of surfactants and co-solvents affect microemulsion properties greatly speeds up the process of arriving at optimal formulations for enhanced recovery of a specific crude oil in a specific oil reservoir. With the main emphasis on reducing the chemical cost of the formulations, a new slate of novel chemicals, both surfactants and co-solvents, has been developed and shown to have superior performance. We have synthesized and tested new classes of surfactants with different hydrophobe sizes and structures varying from large-medium-short-ultrashort in order to meet the needs of a variety of crude oil requirements. We have also developed ultra-short hydrophobe surfactants (with 2-ethylhexanol hydrophobe) possessing dual surfactant / co-solvent properties. Such duality in performance helps, in some cases, to minimize or altogether offset the use of co-solvents while maintaining low microemulsion viscosities, faster equilibration, and other desirable behavior. Thus, 2-ethylhexanol-propoxy-sulfate was developed as a surfactant that also encompasses co-solvent properties. The novel Gemini surfactants have also been incorporated in formulations and core flood experiments with excellent results. The new co-solvents offer advantages such as short equilibration time for the microemulsion formation and lower microemulsion viscosity. Systematic studies using these new surfactants and co-solvents clearly show that we now have the capability of developing highly robust formulations to meet the needs of a variety of reservoirs, resulting in high oil recoveries with low surfactant retention, which is the key to lowering the chemical costs and improving the economics of chemical enhanced oil recovery.

The emerging of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology has made the commercial development of oil sands economically feasible. However, with the recent oil price crash, the development of oil sands has faced an uphill battle. A realistic and integrated evaluation model is highly needed to overcome difficulties from the low oil price and provide meaningful and valuable information for operators as well as investors to make the right decision. The existing evaluation models have considerable limitations (i.e., the incapability of evaluating integrated oil sands development with Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology, the lack of investigation into the input parameters with historical data, and ignoring the effect of the subsurface reservoir, etc.). This study developed an integrated evaluation model through the analyses of a significant amount of actual historical data. This integrated model includes six subcomponent models, ranging from the subsurface reservoir to infield flowline. Data from 35 Canadian oil sands development with 15 internal and external parameters were collected and investigated. The oil price effect was analyzed and quantified through simulations. The breakeven Western Canada Select oil price of $39/bbl. (equal to the West Texas Intermediate oil price of $55/bbl.) and other key price points and distributions were identified. Also, the top seven geological and technical parameters that contribute 86% of the net present value variations were identified and investigated. These quantified effects of external and internal parameters are useful findings for decision making. Considering various price scenarios and uncertainties of the input parameters, this study has concluded that developing oil sands resources with the Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology is economically feasible and socially beneficial after we take all stakeholder interests into consideration, which is true even with the sustainable and realistic oil price in the foreseeable future.

                    "abstract": "Microemulsion phase behavior is the most important phenomenon related to any type of chemical EOR using surfactants. Although the impact of solution gas and pressure on microemulsion phase behavior has been studied for decades, only a very limited amount of data are available in the literature and this is especially true at high temperature and pressure, nor is there a good theory available to guide our understanding of this behavior. A very large number of new chemical EOR projects are underway and almost all of them now involve live oil whereas in the past most of the projects did not involve live oil. The availability of sapphire test tubes rated to 150oC and 5000 psi has greatly extended our laboratory capability to do live oil studies under conditions where almost no data exist. These test tubes allow us to make visual observations very similar to the critical phase behavior observations that we routinely make using glass pipettes at low pressure. For example, the classical emulsion test can be performed to qualitatively estimate the interfacial tension and viscosity. Also, it is easy to observe phase separation of the microemulsion, water and oil, the oil and water solubilization ratios and the equilibration times. This can be done using multiple test tubes so that salinity can be varied to to perform more tests during the past year than all of the previous tests combined in the literature over the past 40 years and most of these new results are at higher temperature and pressure with higher solution gas ratios than previous tests. The results are highly significant with very important implications for field applications to live oil reservoirs. Specifically, we have found the optimum salinity is closer to the dead oil than expected and higher than the value for surrogate oils made based on the equivalent alkane carbon number approach. The development of formulations that meet the aqueous stability criterion at optimum salinity is therefore more challenging than previously realized. "

However, a vertical surfactant flood can be stabilized by gravity if the velocity is below the critical velocity. A modified stability theory was validated by comparison with a series of surfactant-displacement experiments. These experiments also demonstrate that the critical velocity can be increased by optimizing the viscosity of the microemulsion that forms when the surfactant solution mixes with the oil in the porous medium. The microemulsion viscosity is sensitive to formulation variables such as the amount and type of co-solvent added to the surfactant solution. By changing surfactant components, co-solvents, and the concentration of the co-solvents, we were able to successfully control the microemulsion viscosity at optimum salinity to optimize the critical velocities in each surfactant flood. The experiments with optimized microemulsions show that the surfactant-flood velocity can be significantly increased and still recover nearly 100% of the oil. "

                    "abstract": "Classical stability theory predicts the critical velocity for a miscible fluid to be stabilized by gravity forces. This theory was tested for surfactant floods with ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) and was found to be optimistic compared with both laboratory displacement experiments and fine-grid simulations. The inaccurate prediction of instabilities on the basis of available analytical models is because of the complex physics of surfactant floods. First, we simulated vertical sandpack experiments to validate the numerical model. Then, we performed systematic numerical simulations in two and three dimensions to predict formation of instabilities in surfactant floods and to determine the velocity required to prevent instabilities by taking advantage of buoyancy. The 3D numerical grid was refined until the numerical results converged. A third-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) finite-difference method was used for these simulations. We investigated the effects of dispersion, heterogeneity, oil viscosity, relative permeability, and microemulsion viscosity. These results indicate that it is possible to design a very efficient surfactant flood without any mobility control if the surfactant solution is injected at a low velocity in horizontal wells at the bottom of the geological zone and the oil is captured in horizontal wells at the top of the zone. This approach is practical only if the vertical permeability of the geological zone is high. These experiments and simulations have provided new insight into how a gravity-stable, low-tension displacement behaves and in particular the importance of the microemulsion phase and its properties, especially its viscosity. Numerical simulations show high oil-recovery efficiencies on the order of 60% of waterflood residual oil saturation (ROS) for gravity-stable surfactant floods by use of horizontal wells. Thus, under favorable reservoir conditions, gravity-stable surfactant floods are very attractive alternatives to surfactant/polymer floods. Some of the world’s largest oil reservoirs are deep, high-temperature, high-permeability, light-oil reservoirs, and thus candidates for gravity-stable surfactant floods. "

                    "abstract": "Chemical flood reservoir simulators developed based on component partitioning model or empirical phase behavior model lack the effects of physical properties such as surfactant structure and oil properties i.e. equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) on microemulsion phase behavior. Hence, these simulators have limited function in helping formulation design. A typical empirical microemulsion phase behavior model is the Hand's model that is used in UTCHEM, a benchmark chemical flood compositional simulator. However, it needs several matching parameters to fit phase behavior experiments and requires iterative calculations to solve phase compositions. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a chemical flood simulator with a more efficient and physics-based phase behavior model. This work incorporates a physics based HLD-NAC equation of state (EOS) into UTCHEM. A non-iterative flash calculation algorithm based on HLD-NAC microemulsion EOS is developed, which uses simple equations to represent plait point, binodal curve, and tie-lines. Input model parameters include quantitatively characterized physical properties, such as oil EACN, reservoir temperature, surfactant structure properties (head area and tail length), and optimum solubilization ratio. Therefore, the effects of these parameters on oil recovery can be systemically studied. Coreflood simulation results are validated against the Hand's model. Compared to the Hand's model which requires at least 5 matching parameters and with limited predictability, the HLD-NAC EOS can reproduce microemulsion phase behavior with surfactant tail length as the only fitting parameter. Comparing coreflood simulations using the HLD-NAC model and the Hand's model shows that the same oil recovery curves are obtained when slug at optimum salinity is injected. However, for corefloods using a salinity gradient design, HLD-NAC model predicts higher oil recovery than the Hand's model. The reasons for the differences are analyzed by examining the simulated solubilization ratios and ternary phase diagrams at different salinities. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the HLD-NAC model improves the phase behavior computational efficiency by approximately 65%. The effect of live oil at reservoir pressure is also investigated. Results indicate shifted optimal salinity and solubilization ratio due to solution gas and pressure lead to larger microemulsion bank. Owing to the physical significance, simplicity, and computational efficiency of the HLD-NAC EOS, this novel chemical flooding simulator proves to be a fast and promising tool to speed up surfactant screening process and helping chemical formulation development and injection designs.

Enhanced oil recovery from these reservoirs using surfactants to alter the wettability and reduce the interfacial tension have been extensively studied for many years, but there are still many questions about the process mechanisms, surfactant selection and testing, experimental design and most importantly how to scale up the lab results to the field. We have conducted a series of imbibition experiments using cores with different vertical and horizontal dimensions to better understand how to scale up the process. There was a particular need to perform experiments with larger horizontal dimensions since almost all previous experiments have been done in cores with a small diameter, typically 3.8 cm. We adapted and modified the experimental method used for traditional static imbibition experiments by flushing out fluids surrounding the cores periodically to better estimate the oil recovery, including the significant amount of oil produced as an emulsion. We used microemulsion phase behavior tests to develop high performance surfactant formulations for the oils used in this study. These surfactants gave ultra-low IFT at optimum salinity and good aqueous stability. Although we used ultra-low IFT formulations for most of the experiments, we also performed tests at higher IFT for comparison. Even for the higher IFT experiments, the capillary pressure is very small compared to gravity and viscous pressure gradients. We also developed a simple analytical model to predict the oil recovery as a function of vertical and horizontal fracture spacing, rock properties and fluid properties. The model and experimental data are in good agreement considering the many simplifications made to derive the model. The scaling implied by the model is significantly different than traditional scaling groups in the literature. "

An ACP formulation was developed by studying the phase behavior of the oil with several alkaline-cosolvent formulations. The effectiveness of the ACP formulation was validated in a 1D sand pack by conducting a waterflood followed by a stable ACP flood. Sand was then packed into a 2D square steel cell equivalent to a quarter five-spot pattern. Several ACP floods were then conducted in this 2D cell to study both the displacement and sweep efficiency of ACP floods. First, the polymer concentration in the ACP formulation was varied to find an optimum ACP slug viscosity where the oil recovery and pressure gradients are acceptable. When the ACP slug viscosity was about 1/4 of the oil viscosity, oil recovery was 76% OOIP; we adopted this viscosity as the optimum viscosity. Then, using this ACP slug viscosity, the waterflood extent, after which the ACP flood was initiated, was varied (0-1 pore volume). The oil recovery, oil cut, effluent concentration and pressure drop were monitored during the floods. The timing of the tertiary flood did not change the tertiary oil recovery very much. However, shorter the waterflood, faster was the oil recovery under the constant injection rate constraint. Sweep efficiency during secondary ACP flood was lower than that in the tertiary ACP injection. Gravity effect on sweep was significant under ultralow IFT. "

Current methods are based on regional statistics; they have limited applications and the predicted values are not always reliable. In this study, a total of 36 core samples, drilled from Triassic tight sandstone reservoirs of the southwest Ordos Basin in China, were used for laboratory NMR measurements under fully brine saturated and irreducible water conditions. Based on the morphological character analysis of experimental NMR T2 spectra, we demonstrate that NMR T2 spectra can be fully simulated using the normal distribution function. In addition, a new method was proposed, which can predict various T2cutoffs based on the morphological differences of NMR T2 spectra, and the irreducible water saturation (Swirr) was calculated, which represents the ratio of the sum volume of clay bound water and capillary bound water to total pore volume. The reliability of this method was verified by comparing the predicted T2cutoff and Swirr values with those of core NMR experimental results. Finally, we extended this method into field applications in several tight sandstone reservoirs in China. The results show that total T2 distributions of the formation were fully simulated by the normal distribution function, and various T2cutoff and Swirr values were precisely predicted. Meanwhile, tight sands permeability curves, predicted based on the Timur-Coates model, were also accurately estimated. The results of our study may be applied to improve tight sandstone reservoir identification and evaluation using NMR logs. "

In previous studies, analytical/numerical solutions for surfactant flooding were developed dependent on the classical theory of multicomponent/multiphase displacement and empirical microemulsion phase-behavior models. These phase-behavior models were derived from empirical correlations for component-partition coefficients or from the Hand-rule model (Hand 1930), which empirically represents the ternary-phase diagram. These models may lack accuracy or predictive abilities, which may lead to improper formulation design or unreliable recovery predictions. To provide a more-insightful understanding of the mechanisms of surfactant flooding, we introduced a novel microemulsion phase-behavior equation of state (EOS) dependent on the hydrophilic/lipophilic-difference (HLD) equation and the net-average curvature (NAC) model, which is called HLD-NAC EOS hereafter. An analytical model for surfactant flooding was developed dependent on coherence theory and this novel HLD-NAC EOS for two-phase three-component displacement. Composition routes, component profile along the core, and oil recovery can be determined from the analytical solution. The analytical solution was validated against numerical simulation as well as experimental study. This HLD-NAC EOS based analytical solution enables a systematic study of the effects of phase-behavior-dependent variables on surfactant-flooding performance. The effects of solution gas and pressure on microemulsion phase behavior were investigated. It was found that an increase of solution gas and pressure would lead to enlarged microemulsion bank and narrowed oil bank. For a surfactant formulation designed at standard conditions, the analytical solution was able to quantitatively predict its performance under reservoir conditions. "

Effects of friction and boundary conditions on the critical load of helical buckling are investigated. Theoretical results show that the effect of boundary conditions on helical buckling becomes negligible for a long pipe with dimensionless length greater than 5p. Velocity analysis shows that lateral friction becomes dominant at the instant of buckling initiation. Thus, friction can increase the critical load of helical buckling significantly. However, once buckling is initiated, axial velocity becomes dominant again and lateral friction becomes negligible for post-buckling behavior and axial-load-transfer analysis. Consequently, it is possible to seek an analytical solution for the buckling equation. Analytical solutions for both sinusoidal and helical post-buckling configurations are derived, and a practical procedure for modeling of axial load transfer is proposed. To verify the proposed model and analytical results, the authors also conducted experimental studies. Experimental results support the proposed solutions. "

                    "abstract": "Significant fluid loss while drilling through fractured formations is a major problem for drilling operations. From field experience, we know that the type and rheological parameters of the drilling fluid have a strong impact upon the rate and volume of losses. A mathematical model for Herschel-Bulkley [yield-power-law (YPL)] drilling-fluid losses in naturally fractured formations is presented. As a result, the effect of rheological properties of drilling fluid such as yield stress and shear-thinning/-thickening effect (flow-behavior index) on mud losses in fractured formations is investigated. We found that the yield stress can control the ultimate volume of losses while the shear-thinning effect can tremendously decrease the rate of losses. Therefore, mud losses in fractures can be minimized by optimizing the rheology of the drilling fluid properly. The model also allows for quantitative analysis of losses that take into account fluid rheology to characterize the fractures. Hydraulic aperture of conductive fractures can be obtained by continuously monitoring mud losses and fitting field records of mud losses to the model. The proposed model is very useful not only for drilling applications but also for well-completion design and fractured-reservoir-characterization purposes. To examine the validity of the model, a practical application of the proposed technique is demonstrated through a field example of mud-loss measurements in a fractured well in the Gulf of Mexico. "

                    "abstract": "An experimental study followed by comprehensive flow modeling is presented. The experiments were conducted on a horizontal annulus with drillstring under compression, considering the influence of rotation on frictional pressure losses of yield-power-law (YPL) fluids. Flow through various buckling configurations with and without drillstring rotation was investigated. Correlations of critical Reynolds numbers are presented that predict the onset and offset of transition from laminar- to turbulent-flow regions in concentric and eccentric annuli. A broad model of flow of YPL fluids is proposed for concentric, eccentric, and buckled configurations. The model includes the effects of rotation in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. A 91-ft inner pipe was rotated while applying axial compression during flow. At the no-compression case, eccentricity of the inner pipe is varied as the drillstring rotated. The aim for such a design was to simulate actual drilling operations. The test matrix involves flow through sinusoidal, transitional, and helically buckled drillstring. The effect of pitch length is investigated. Helical modes with two different pitch lengths were tested. Eight distinct YPL fluids were used to examine the dependence of pressure losses on fluid parameters. In the theoretical part, a stability criterion is modified to determine the onset of transitional flow of YPL fluids and a correlation is proposed for practical purposes. In addition, pressure-loss-prediction models are presented for the flow of YPL fluids through concentric, eccentric, free, and buckled configurations of the drillstring, with and without rotation. The proposed models are compared with data from the literature and the experiments. It has been observed that increasing eccentricity and rotary speed causes an earlier transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Results suggest reduced pressure losses with an eccentric pipe. In addition, buckled configurations showed a further decrease of frictional pressure losses as the compression increases. In the helical mode, two pitch lengths are compared, and decreasing the pitch length resulted in a decrease in pressure losses. Rotation tests are conducted with free and buckled configurations. Rotation in the free-drillstring mode showed an increase in pressure losses as the rotary speed of the drillstring increases. Amplified vigorous motion of the drillstring is visually observed as the drillstring is buckled while rotating. Rotating the drillstring while buckled showed a further increase in pressure losses compared to rotating in free mode. This additional increase in pressure losses is attributed to the more-dynamic motion of the drillstring. Distinct differences of pressure losses in the effects of buckling and rotation are observed in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. Significant differences are measured in the transition region. "

It is believed that impermeable rocks experience high differential pressures because of shear dilatancy and become stronger and, thus, more difficult to drill. However, recently performed atmospheric and pressurized single-cutter experiments show that contrary to this belief, even at low pressures (100-200 psig) and even with permeable rocks, significant increase in mechanical specific energy (MSE) is observed compared to atmospheric tests. The experiments were carried out in a single-cutter high-pressure testing facility refurbished with high-precision sensors and a data acquisition system. In the experiments, a 13-mm polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) cutter was used to cut Carthage marble and Indiana limestone samples with depths of cut ranging from 0.025 to 0.050 in. More than 70 high-precision tests were performed on these two rock types under confining pressures ranging from 0 to 1000 psig. The confining fluids were either water or mineral oil. Unexpectedly, analysis of the MSE consistently showed that increases in the confining pressure as small as 150 psig can increase the MSE of the cutting process significantly and reduce the cutting efficiency by half. These reductions in the cutting efficiency that were even more dramatic in the permeable and saturated Indiana limestone could not be explained by the strengthening of the rock under confining pressures. Upon analysis of the results of experiments (cutting forces, volume of cuts, and visual inspections of cuttings), a new theory was proposed to explain this unexpected behavior. This new theory, based on the frictional forces and the cutting mechanism under pressure, gives useful insights into the physics of cutter-rock interaction. Such insights are invaluable to the improvements of drilling practices selection [weight on bit (WOB), type of drilling fluid, and its properties] and the ROPs. "

                    "abstract": "This paper is a focused theoretical and experimental study on the dynamic buckling and snaking motions of rotating pipe in a horizontal well. First, a comprehensive dynamic buckling model is presented. As part of this model, a group of fourth-order nonlinear partial-differential equations is derived and discussed. Then, a perturbation solution of the model is obtained that represents the snaking motion of the rotating pipe. On the basis of the perturbation solution, critical dynamic buckling load and dynamic behavior of rotating pipe are analyzed. It has been found that there are two different kinds of snaking motion. In one type, the pipe moves up and down around its static buckling configuration. In the other type, the pipe moves from one side of the wellbore to the other side. The authors also conducted an experimental study with a small-scale experimental facility. Depending on axial compressive load and rotating speed, different motion patterns of drilling pipe are observed. Measurements of axial load at both ends and axial displacement at the loaded end are recorded. These observations and measurements provide us with very important information about the dynamic behavior of rotating pipe in a horizontal well. Observations also show that the pipe may take two different patterns of snaking motions. Both critical static buckling load and dynamic buckling load were measured with this facility. Both theoretical and experimental results show that pipe rotation does not affect the critical load of dynamic buckling. Experiments also show that there exist two different kinds of snaking motions, which support the analytical solution of the dynamic model presented in this paper. The results are useful for practical design applications related to calculation of buckling loads and selection of bottomhole-assembly (BHA) elements and pipe rotational speeds. "

                    "abstract": "Although rotary drilling is being used in most wells, the impact of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during foam drilling has not been investigated. There has been no single predictive tool developed to address pipe rotation effects on foam drilling. This paper presents the first study of cuttings transport using foam with pipe rotation under simulated downhole conditions. A field-scale, high-pressure/high-temperature wellbore simulator with a 73-ft-long, 5.76 x 3.5-in. eccentric annular test section was used to investigate the effects of pipe rotation, foam quality and velocity, downhole pressure and temperature on cuttings transport, and pressure losses in a horizontal wellbore. Experiments were conducted with backpressures from 100 to 400 psi and temperatures from 80 to 160°F. Pipe rotary speeds were varied from 0 to 120 RPM, with foam qualities ranging from 60 to 90% and foam velocities from 2 to 5 ft/sec. It was found that pipe rotation not only significantly decreases cuttings concentration in a horizontal annulus but also results in a considerable reduction in frictional pressure loss. The reduction in cuttings concentration is up to 40% at a medium foam velocity (3 ft/sec) when pipe is rotated up to 120 RPM. The decrease in frictional pressure loss is up to 50% at a medium foam velocity and is more than 60% at a low velocity. Using a higher foam velocity or quality also improves hole cleaning; however, pressure losses are significantly increased. A mechanistic model and an associated computer simulator were developed for practical design and field applications. It can be used to predict cuttings concentration, bed height, and pressure drop during horizontal foam drilling with various pipe rotary speeds, eccentricities, foam qualities, and velocities under different pressure and temperature conditions. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results show that the difference is less than 15% in most of the cases. "

                    "title": "The Effects of Back Rake and Side Rake Angles on Mechanical Specific Energy of Single PDC Cutters with Selected Rocks at Varying Depth of Cuts and Confining Pressures",
                    "abstract": "Abstract One of the key objectives within the drilling industry is optimizing rate of penetration (ROP) and a major contributor to obtaining this objective is the PDC bit design. Whilst previous papers have proven that the PDC cutting structure geometry, particularly back rake and side rake angles, affect PDC bit performance when tested at atmospheric conditions, no information in the SPE literature exists for similar tests at confining pressures. The effect of side rake angle on cutter aggresiveness and cutter interaction at depths of cut (DOC) in excess of 0.04?? are particularly unknown under confined pressure.  The results of more than 150 tests show that back rake and side rake angles have substantial effects on Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the aggressiveness of PDC cutters. Experiments with three different rock types; Carthage marble, Mancos shale, and Torrey Buff sandstone, revealed that at both atmospheric and elevated confining pressures, PDC cutters with 10 deg back rake angles require half the energy to cut the same volume of rock and produce higher cutting efficiency compared with cutters having 40 deg back rake angles. Possible reasons for this behavior are explained through the analysis of the cutting process.  Results show that a cutter with low back rake requires less horizontal cutting force in order to cut the same volume of rock. This observation indicates that not only will a PDC bit with lower back rake angles, drill more efficiently, but it will also require less torque in order to drill at the same ROP. Other factors such as reduced durability of cutters at low back rake angles should also be considered while applying these results to PDC bit designs.  Test results at both atmospheric and confining pressures revealed that MSE decreases with increasing DOC up to 0.08?? on all three rock types. However, the tests also showed that MSE starts to increase slightly at DOCs above 0.08??, possibly suggesting an optimal minimum DOC.  Experimental results also show that, whilst Mancos shale and Carthage marble have about the same compressive strength, Mancos shale requires three times less energy to cut compared to Carthage marble. This indicates that, compressive strength of some rocks such as shales cannot be used alone as a reference rock property for accurately evaluating and comparing drilling efficiency.  A new 3D mechanistic PDC cutter-rock interaction model was also developed which incorporates the effects of both back rake and side rake angles, along with rock specific coefficient of friction. The results from this single-cutter model are encouraging as they are consistent with the experimental data. "

                    "title": "Stability Analysis of Pipe with Connectors in Horizontal Wells",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Except for coiled tubing, most tubular goods used for down-hole operations such as drilling pipe and sucker rod have connectors. Since a connector and the pipe-body have different outer radius, the deformation and buckling behavior of a pipe with connectors constrained in a wellbore are much more complicated. However, most buckling models were established by neglecting the existence and effects of connectors.  In this paper, buckling equations of a pipe with connectors in horizontal wells were derived with application of elastic beam theory. The axis of an unbuckled pipe is a 2-D curve in the vertical plane, and has three configurations: no contact, point contact and wrap contact. We derived the two critical distances between connectors, Lc1 and Lc2, beyond which a pipe changes its configuration from one to another. The authors proposed an algorithm to determine the critical force (Fcrs) of buckling by numerically solving the buckling equations using the 4th order Ronge-Kuta method.  Both the distance between two adjacent connectors (Lc) and the radius difference between a connector and the pipe-body (?rc) have significant impact on the critical force, in addition to net clearance between a pipe and wellbore (r0), bending stiffness (EI) and weight per unit length (w) of pipe. When Lc is small, radial deflection is negligible. Fcrs increases as ?rc increases. However, when Lc is close to Lc1, effects of radial displacement become significant, and Fc decreases dramatically as ?rc increases. Fcrs decreases as Lc increases when Lc< Lc1, and it reaches its minimum at Lc=Lc1. When Lc> Lc1, Fcrs fluctuates as Lc increases. Some curves of Lc1, Lc2 and Fcrs, all in dimensionless forms, were calculated and presented in this paper for practical applications.  Our numerical results show that the critical force may reduce 20-60% for commonly used drill pipes and sucker rods with centralizers, which indicates that a pipe string designed without considering the effects of connectors may be risky. The results presented in this paper may provide some practical guidance for optimal design of centralizers for sucker rod strings, or may avoid some risks due to improper design of drilling pipe strings.

                    "abstract": "Abstract Instability issues often occur when water-based muds are applied to shale formations. Failure to predict the pore pressure accurately has been widely accepted as one of the major reasons causing shale instability. Water activity is a key factor to control the pore fluid moving in and out of the formation due to osmotic effects. Ideal and single-solute models have been developed in the past to predict the pore pressure by considering chemical osmotic effects. However, due to their complex nature, pore fluids/drilling fluids rarely behave as ideal solutions. A new model has been developed to predict pore pressure in shale formations that takes into account the non-ideality and multiple solutes of both drilling fluid and pore fluid. Transient pore pressure profiles and water activity are obtained from the coupled equations developed in this study. A Shale-Fluid Interaction Testing Cell (SFITC) has been developed in this study to test the interaction between the drilling fluid and the pore fluid. Parameters involved in the model, such as hydraulic conductivity, membrane efficiency and ion diffusion rate can be obtained through experimental data curve fitting. Model predictions have been compared with lab data and good agreement has been achieved. Water activity is found to be crucial for pore pressure control in shale formations. Simulation results explain the fact that salinity of drilling fluids has to be controlled in order to achieve shale stability. Results of this study can benefit drilling fluid design. Shale instability can be reduced by \"balancing?? the water activities of shale and drilling fluid. This can be achieved through changing the type of solutes and their concentrations based on information of the initial water activity of the shale. Wellbore stability models can obtain more accurate results by including the proposed pore pressure propagation model, which considers drilling fluid-induced chemical osmotic in-situ stress.  Introduction Currently more than 75% of drilled formations are shales and more than 90% of wellbore instability problems are related to shale formations (Dzialowski et.al., 1993). The common shale instability-related problems include tight spots, stuck pipe, hole caving, lost circulation, wellbore breathing and total wellbore collapse, which can result in well abandonment. Based on conservative reports, shale instability issues cost the oil and gas industry more than 6 billion U.S. dollars per year (SPE review, SPE-UK, 2005). Although shale instability has been studied for many years, it remains one of the major drilling challenges for the oil and gas industry. The solutions for shale problems have been trial and error, which results in high overall well-costs and rig-time losses.  It is well known that preventing pressure invasion into a shale matrix is an effective method in maintaining shale stability (Yeung 1993, van Oort 1997, Huang 1998, Yamamoto 2002, Zhang 2006, Russell 2008). Knowledge of pore fluid pressure is indispensible to address the wellbore stability problem. In the past, oil-based muds (OBM) and synthetic oil muds have been the preferred choices for drilling shale formations. Their application has been justified on the basis of borehole stability, penetration rate, fluid loss, filter cake quality, lubricity, and temperature stability. As environmental regulations have restricted the use of diesel and mineral oil-based muds, water-based muds (WBM) became attractive alternatives to oil-based mud systems from both cost and environmental perspectives. However, unlike oil-base mud, which could generate a considerable threshold capillary pressure to prevent the mud pressure penetrating into the near wellbore region, field applications of water-based muds for drilling shale formations often encountered wellbore stability problems.

                    "abstract": "Field evidence indicates that the thermal regime in wellbore considerably affects the wellbore stability in directional and horizontal wells. However, the temperature effects have not been investigated thoroughly in existing literature, and the effects of drilling fluid flow and various heat sources on the behavior of formation temperature profiles during different operations are often neglected. The affected formation temperature in the vicinity of the wellbore could result in different formation rock behaviors and consequent wellbore stability problems. This study is conducted to examine the effect of temperature on the stability of the near wellbore region, taking into account the heat transfer between formation and flowing drilling fluid with the consideration of mechanical friction and associated heat sources. A new model is proposed that is applicable to directional and horizontal wells. The model incorporates thermal effects due to the drag forces created from the contacts between drillpipe and casing/formation during drilling and tripping operations.  It is then utilized in a number of configurations of directional wells to study temperature profiles behaviors and their effects on wellbore stability. It is observed that the drilling fluid temperature is noticeably under-predicted by existing literature, and in some cases it can easily exceed the geothermal formation temperature if mechanical friction is taken into account. The formation temperature profile near the borehole region is also found to be considerably affected when wellbore heat transfer is considered, as opposed to the constant wall temperature approach in existing literature. These differences alternate the temperature induced stresses and consequently change the mud weight window for wellbore stability prediction. The proposed model and the results of this study are very useful for more accurate analyses of wellbore stability problems with a more detailed look into the effects of temperature. They can be used to enhance predictions of thermal regime in the wellbore at the design stage of well development or mud weight selection during drilling operation, thereby, avoiding potential drilling fluid/drillstring overheating and wellbore stability problems. Introduction The temperature profile during drilling extended reach (ERD) wells can be very different from those of more conventional wells. This temperature profile can be difficult to calculate. This occurs especially if the water depth is limited and cooling of the drilling fluid is insufficient. Several North Sea field examples during drilling long 17 ½?? and 12 ¼?? sections demonstrate that the fluid temperature can be far in excess of the maximum observed formation temperature in the well. One example is from a long 17 ½?? ERD section where the maximum formation temperature was close to 45°C, while the maximum observed drilling fluid temperature in the annulus was 86°C. Even the temperature on the shaker was more than 60°C. Indications exist that the increase in drilling fluid temperature is larger if hole cleaning is good. "

                    "abstract": "One of the major concerns when drilling deepwater wells is fluid loss since the fracture gradients are typically lower than their onshore counterparts. Failure to minimize the fluid loss can significantly increase the cost of drilling, and even lead to abandonment of the well. Successful management of lost circulation should incorporate accurate estimation of loss zone location, followed by corresponding lost circulation control procedures. This paper presents an innovative way to estimate the location of mud loss by interpreting distributed temperature measurement which is facilitated by a recently developed drilling microchip technology. Firstly, a transient wellbore thermal model is presented to predict the effect of mud loss on the change in circulating mud temperature profile for tubular fluids. The model is developed based on heat balance equations with variable local flow rates along the wellbore due to the mud loss. The effects of heat transfer above the seabed between riser and the drilling muds are included. Downward shifts in the temperature curves are noted in both the drillpipe and annulus. With distributed temperature measurement data, the derivative of annulus temperature with respect to depth can be used to effectively identify the location of the loss zone. A case study has been conducted to identify the location of a loss zone in a deepwater well. According to the results, a jump in the derivative coincides with the location of loss and is sufficiently significant in magnitude to be identified. The seawater-riser heat transfer has minimum effect on the loss zone prediction; furthermore, the effect of the same amount of loss is more conspicuous if the loss occurs at a shallower depth, in which case the loss zone can be more reliably located.

Both theoretical and experimental approaches are followed to better understand the onset of transitional flow. The objective of this study is to investigate the stability of the flow in concentric and eccentric annuli. Theoretical analysis of the inner and outer shear regions, to clarify the earlier transition observed with experimental studies, are within the scope of this study. A stability criterion based on the ratio of turbulent energy production and rate of work done by viscous stresses is used to determine the end of laminar flow. Experiments are conducted for laminar, transition and turbulent regions of flow in a fully eccentric annulus. Eight distinct YPL fluids are tested and the results are compared with a proposed model and models available in the literature. The proposed stability parameter shows an earlier transition near the outer wall for a wide range of non-Newtonian fluids, which is in agreement with measurements in the literature. The proposed modification is extended to eccentric annuli and showed good agreement with experiments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to locally predict the onset of transition in eccentric annuli of YPL fluids. Transition from laminar to turbulent significantly depends on eccentricity, diameter ratio and fluid properties, especially to the shear thinning ability of a fluid. The proposed modification allows a fair prediction of the transition from laminar to turbulent regions in eccentric annuli. With the proposed approach, the percentage of laminar and non-laminar regions for a cross section of an eccentric annulus can be predicted. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract In horizontal and highly deviated portions of an Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) well, cuttings beds form on the low-side of the annulus. The bed partially blocks the annulus resulting in excessive pressure loss and a higher equivalent circulating density (ECD) that is exacerbated by the increase in length of the annulus. This condition limits hole-cleaning capabilities. As a result, selecting favorable drilling parameters is not always sufficient to overcome the hole cleaning problem. Recently, the use of downhole Mechanical Cleaning Devices (MCDs) has been introduced to the industry to mitigate the problem without inducing excessive ECD. Although the use of these tools is increasing, very limited studies have been conducted to optimize their performance.  This paper presents results of an experimental study that was carried out to evaluate cuttings removal efficiency of MCDs and applications of MCDs for optimizing ERD systems. Experiments were carried out in a large-scale flow loop that has an 8-inch transparent test section. Three different drillpipe sizes were considered in the investigation. The Taguchi approach was implemented to reduce the number of experiments while covering the most relevant parameters such as flow rate, ROP, diameter ratio, tool design and drillpipe rotation speed. For each test, the amount of cuttings accumulated in the test section was determined from weight measurements. Results indicate that the tools significantly reduce the amount of cuttings in the annulus, especially around the MCDs, compared to locations where there is no tool.  Experimental results were evaluated to obtain the overall effect of operating parameters on annular cuttings concentration and develop correlations. The results show that the flow rate and inclination angle have the most significant impact. The correlations are useful to develop an analytical model for designing and optimizing drilling systems with MCDs, either in terms of operating parameters or drillstring design.  1. Introduction Efficient cuttings transport is an important issue in drilling highly deviated and horizontal wells. In directional wells, drilled cuttings tend to accumulate on the lower side of the annulus and form a thick cuttings bed when the flow velocity becomes insufficient to suspend the cuttings bed particles. Particularly, in high-angle and horizontal boreholes, the formation of thick cuttings bed can give rise to numerous difficulties such as lost circulation, differential sticking, high torque and drag. Recently, hydro-mechanical hole cleaning devices such as HydrocleanTM tools have been developed to enhance cuttings transport efficiency in directional wells. These tools are introduced in the drillstring with different spacing arrangements. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: There has been an increasing consciousness regarding to the stress changes associated with reservoir depletion as the industry moves toward more challenging jobs in deep-water or depleted reservoirs. These stress changes have a significant impact on the design of wells in these situations. Therefore, accurate prediction of reservoir stress path, i.e., change in horizontal stresses with pore pressure, is of vital importance. In this paper, a new formulation of stress path is developed that enable us to predict the effect of pore pressure on both minimum and maximum horizontal stresses in the presence of non-hydrostatic stress field for future well design consideration. According to the results, change of minimum horizontal stress with pore pressure is always larger than the change of maximum horizontal stress. Non-equal change of horizontal stresses increases the difference between them during production history. Using the new formulation, we are able to find the effect of pore pressure on formation fracture pressure in deviated wells, as well. Fracture initiation pressure change with pore pressure is larger parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal stress. Thus, we would have less wellbore instability problems if we drill toward the minimum horizontal stress direction after depletion. "

                    "abstract": "While drilling through depleted or partially depleted reservoirs, one may encounter a series of problems (e.g., lost circulation, non-productive time, etc.) due to narrow mud weight window (MWW). Fracture-based strengthening techniques used in the industry effectively increase fracture reopening pressure (FROP) and ultimately reduce the cost of associated problems. However, traditional analytical and numerical studies using these techniques do not consider the time effect and usually ignore the fluid dynamics. Thus, these deficiencies may result in inaccurate wellbore strengthening operations if no proper fracture diagnostic techniques are available to acquire the real-time fracture geometry. In this paper, a quasi-static, dislocation-based fracture model is extended using fluid mass conservation with leak-off. A fixed dimensionless fracture coordinate system is employed and a numerical simulation procedure is developed. The model is capable of predicting real-time fracture geometry (both fracture width and length) from given wellbore conditions. Hence, it could provide optimal particle size distribution (PSD) selection for wellbore strengthening applications. Two case studies are performed and results reveal different fluid controlling mechanisms during the fracture propagation, which are fluid storage in fractures and fluid leak-off to surrounding formation. Drilling through low permeability reservoirs (e.g., tight gas reservoirs or shale reservoirs) is different from drilling in conventional reservoirs because fast propagation of induced fractures may interact with natural fractures and result in severe lost circulation. This model is of critical importance in designing wellbore strengthening operations during drilling. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Lost circulation in fractured formations is one of the drilling's biggest expenses in terms of non-productive time (NPT), unit mud cost and safety issues. The severity and persistence of losses are to a large extent determined by the type of formation into which the fluid is being lost. It is imperative to identify whether the losses are to natural or induced fractures as losses into naturally fractured rocks require different treatments than those into drilling induced fractures. One way of identifying the type of the fracture is by image logs which are very local and limited to conductive muds, so still in their infancy and have yet to gain wide acceptance. An alternative way is possible by looking into flow behavior of mud losses (flow in/out) and associated downhole pressure response (PWD data).  This work presents an analytical formulation describing mud losses in drilling induced fractures based on which the volume and rate of losses in an induced fracture are quantified in terms of fluid properties, fracture parameters and operational conditions. Comparison between the predicted mud losses into induced and natural fractures indicates that much higher pressure sensitivity is anticipated during mud losses into induced fractures. Hence, the pressure sensitivity analysis can be used as a means to distinguish between the losses into natural and induced fractures. Once the fracture type is identified, the fracture parameters (hydraulic width or compliance) can be estimated by analyzing mud loss data. As the outcome of this study, guidelines are provided for the best practices to be used for prevention and control of lost circulation.  Introduction Lost circulation is extremely costly to many drilling operations in terms of mud costs and non-productive time. The severity and the frequency of lost circulation problems broadly depend upon the type of formation to which the fluid is being lost. For many years the drilling industry has used lost circulation material (LCM) to deal with lost circulation problems. However, results from the use of these additives have not appeared to be consistent. A more systematic engineered approach should be taken to formulate drilling fluids that can effectively control the losses while drilling. The developments of such methods are influenced by a number of parameters including type of losses, properties of mud and the permeability of the formation, the range of particle sizes, the extension and width of fractures.  Generally, lost circulation can occur in three distinct types of formations: 1) highly permeable zones where the whole mud loss is to the formation and is indicated by a gradual lowering of the fluid level in the mud tanks, 2) cavernous or vugular usually are found in limestone and dolomite formations where mud losses may be sudden and complete upon penetration and the drillstring may actually drop several feet and 3) fractures. Fractures are the suspected cause of lost circulation when a high frequency and severity of lost circulation events are encountered. Fractures are classified as either naturally occurring or hydraulically induced. Drilling fluid losses to a formation can be via a fracture which has been induced through drilling operations or was a pre-existing natural facture. If pre-existing, the fracture may be permanently open in which case losses to the formation may occur at mud pressures only in excess of the formation pressure. Induced losses occur when the mud weight, required for well control and to maintain a stable wellbore, exceeds the fracture resistance of the formations. It is crucial to distinguish natural fractures from those induced by the drilling process so that the drilling program can be modified to minimize the impact accordingly. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture-based wellbore strengthening techniques have been widely used in the oil industry to reduce the cost of lost circulation, especially in depleted reservoirs. Accurate prediction of induced-fracture geometry is of critical importance for best particle size distribution (PSD) selection of wellbore strengthening materials (WSM). Conventional parametric analyses mainly focused on rock properties, well conditions and WSM plug location. Thus, the deficiency of ignoring time and fluid dynamics may result in erroneous operations. In this paper, a dynamic fracture model based on the dislocation method is employed to qualitatively characterize the influence of controllable parameters on fracture propagation and fracture reopening pressure (FROP). Fracture propagation length and profile are obtained for each parameter with different values. It is found that fluid injection rate, fluid viscosity, fluid injection time, wellbore inclination and wellbore radius have an inverse relationship with FROP. On the other hand, fracture plug width has a positive relationship with FROP. Finally, a procedure for determining optimal wellbore strengthening operations by manipulating the controllable parameters is developed based on the dynamic fracture model. "

                    "abstract": "Lost circulation is one of the most persistent and costly drilling problems that drilling engineers have been struggling with for decades. The pinpointing of the zones of loss allows the treatments to be applied directly to the points of loss rather than to the entire open hole. This paper presents an approach to predict the location of single loss zone in a vertical well by interpreting the transient mud circulating temperature profiles altered by mud loss. The fluid flow and heat transfer numerical model in estimating the transient mud circulating temperature profiles during a lost circulation event was developed. The temperature profile in both the flow conduits (drillpipe and annulus) were modeled using mass and energy balances. The flow rate of drilling mud decreases in the annulus above the loss zone as part of the fluids lost into the fractures, which in turn alters the heat transmission status between the drillpipe, annulus, and near-wellbore formation. The wellbore is divided into two sections, which accounts for single loss zone. Case studies were performed and numerical solution results were presented and analyzed. According to the results, alterations induced by mud loss include: 1) Declines in both annular mud temperature and drillpipe mud temperature over time, and 2) Discontinuity in the first order derivative of annular mud temperature with respect to depth at the location of loss. By matching the simulated results with the distributed temperature measurements at different time stamps, the depth of the loss zone can be identified. "

A practical numerical model is proposed that accurately estimates the annular frictional pressure losses with and without the inner pipe rotation. Experiments are conducted at a 91 ft. long flow loop using various fluids that can be characterized as Yield Power Law (YPL). A commercial CFD software is used to validate the proposed numerical approach. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed model, CFD results, experimental results, the published experimental results and most widely used models from the literature is presented. The experimental setup simulates horizontal wellbore applications, which are increasingly prevalent due to recent shale plays. Today, since most drilling fluids show YPL behavior, YPL fluids with a wide range of rheological properties are used as test fluids in this study. The numerical model is coupled with a stability criterion that determines the onset and offset of the transitional flow between laminar and turbulent regions. The velocity profiles of a wide range of diameter ratios, Taylor and Reynolds numbers are presented. Various degrees of eccentricity are analyzed in terms of pressure profile and flow stability with the proposed method. The results from the experiments show significantly reduced pressure drops in fully eccentric annuli compared to concentric geometry. An increase in pressure loss is observed as the pipe is rotated while it is eccentric. The comparisons between the models indicate that the slot approximation can result in large errors especially when the diameter ratio is low. A 3D wellbore can be evaluated with grids using the proposed numerical method and the local stability criterion, which leads to accurate pressure loss estimations. Grid analysis can show the flow state profile and the pressure loss profile of a wellbore, which has potential to optimize operations in real-time or in the design phase. This study contributes to a better understanding of flow in annuli. The results obtained from this study are useful to predict the transition and the annular frictional pressure loss profiles more accurately than existing methods. Potential applications include risk avoidance and optimized operations. "

                    "abstract": "During drilling operations, control of the sub-surface pressure is of utmost importance. High density minerals, such as barite and hematite, are used to increase the density of drilling fluids and thereby control these pressures. However, contributing factors, such as the gravitational force, cause the weighting material particles to settle out of the suspension. This is designated as “sag” within the drilling industry and can lead to a variety of major drilling problems, including lost circulation, well control difficulties, poor cement jobs, and stuck pipes. The study of this phenomenon, including ways to mitigate its effects, has long been of interest. In this paper several methods for evaluating dynamic barite sag in oil-based drilling fluids are examined in a flow loop with the use of a rotational viscometer modified by the addition of a sag shoe (MRV). Tests using the MRV in the range of 0–100 RPM were conducted, and the effects of rotation speed on sag were correlated with flow loop tests performed by varying the inner pipe rotation speed. The combined effects of eccentricity and pipe rotation on dynamic barite sag in oil-based drilling fluids are also described in this paper. Flow loop test results indicate that pipe rotation has a greater impact on reducing sag when the pipe is eccentric rather than concentric. Additionally, results in the MRV indicate a strong correlation between the test RPM and the degree of measured sag. "

                    "abstract": "A chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model considering the shale transverse isotropic effect is developed. In poroelastic theory, the pore fluid motion and solid structure deformation are coupled. Lubinski's one-way coupling scheme is adopted in this study which assumed a rock has strong structure and the effect of solid skeleton deformation on fluid flow is negligible. It is found that normal stress along the cylindrical axis is affected by Young's modulus on both the symmetrical plane and the axial direction. A Taguchi orthogonal simulation design strategy is adopted to reduce the number of simulations while still achieving meaningful results. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted and parameter contributions to the mud weight window have been investigated. It can be found that among the 11 parameters of interest, wellbore inclination angle, hydraulic conductivity and water activity of drilling fluid play the most important roles in determining the mud weight window. Knowledge of percentage contributions of the parameters in this chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model greatly helps drilling engineers identify the critical factors for wellbore stability control. This study also helps well trajectory design and drilling fluid optimization. Introduction Drilling the wellbore is usually the most expensive step in oil and gas exploration activities. It is reported that wellbore instability issues cost the petroleum industry alone an estimated 8 billion US dollars annually (Diwan 2011). As a consequence, designing a good drilling strategy has significant importance in petroleum engineering. Wellbore instability in drilling shale formations with water based mud has been studied for many years but still a big challenge for drilling engineers. Prior to drilling, a shale formation is in a state of mechanical, hydraulic and chemical equilibrium. Drilling disturb these natural equilibrium, resulting in the alteration of local stresses by deformation of the borehole and enforcement of hydraulic and chemical potential gradients. Shales are sedimentary rock characterized by their finely laminated structure, low permeability, high clay content and cation exchange capacity.  The mechanical properties along the bedding plane are different from the mechanical properties through the thickness direction. As a consequence, shale should not be simply considered as isotropic material. Numerous wellbore instability problems have been reported when drilling through laminated and chemically reactive shale formations(Last et al.1995; Okland et al.1998; Beacom et al.2001). Wellbore stability models considering anisotropic body(Amadei 1983; Abousleiman et al.1995) are not rare while wellbore stability models considering a shale's chemical effect(Ghassemi et at. 1999; Yu et al. 2003) are not rare neither. However, few of the wellbore stability models take into account shale's chemical effect and anisotropic effect together. Therefore, a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model considering shale isotropic effect is developed in this paper to better analyze the stress distribution near the wellbore region. "

                    "abstract": "Annular pressure build up (APB) is an important problem in the area of well design. Different solutions have been proposed to mitigate APB, including vacuum-insulated tubing, silicate foam wellbore insulation techniques, and insulating with completion (packer) fluids. However, proposed solutions that include the optimization of annular fluid rheology of drilling fluids trapped in the outer annuli need further investigation. Convective and conductive heat transfer through fluids placed between the casing strings is a driving force for increasing annular pressure. This study explains how to design and optimize the rheological and thermal properties of drilling fluid to provide a sustainable and reliable insulating performance. The objectives of this study are 1) to develop a better insight of APB in the annulus of casing and 2) to experimentally measure and 3) analytically model the effect of different parameters, such as rheological and thermal properties, on the insulating performance of drilling fluid trapped in annular spaces. By combining the theory of sedimentation and the model proposed for free convective heat transfer of Yield Power Law fluids, a stepwise guideline is proposed to estimate the Nusselt number and thermal conductivity coefficient of annular fluids. A computer code to perform this procedure has been developed. Additionally, a unique experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to investigate the insulating performance of drilling fluids. Experimental observation and model results indicate that compressive yield stress, density difference between the solid and liquid phases of a drilling fluid, solid particle size and annular space geometry, are four important factors that determine sedimentation rate. These criteria can be used to characterize YPL annular fluid properties to minimize sedimentation rate and consequently to reduce free convective flow. The magnitude of the convective heat transfer coefficient is affected by the shear yield stress and density of annular fluid, by the flow behavior index (m), consistency index (k), conductivity coefficient and specific heat of the YPL fluid, and by annular space clearance. This conclusion can be used to quantitatively analyze the reliability and sustainability of the insulating performance of drilling fluids. The sedimentation profile, shear yield stress distribution and effective conductivity coefficient profile as functions of time and depth, as well as the Nusselt number, Nu, as a function of temperature difference in the radial direction can be estimated by the introduced guideline. The most important achievement is that the developed guideline can be used as a design tool in offshore drilling and completion operations to mitigate APB. A practical benefit of this study is demonstrated by the application of its findings in an illustrative example. "

While frictional pressure losses in concentric and fully eccentric annuli have been studied before, this paper focuses on the effect of arbitrary eccentricities on velocity profile and corresponding influence on frictional pressure losses. In this study, axial flow of yield-power-law (YPL) fluids in eccentric annuli for a 2D steady-state flow has been investigated numerically and verified against experiments. A boundary-fitted coordinate system is used to discretize the flow equations and generate the mesh network. Fluid-flow equations were solved adopting an iterative method. The results of simulation include the effects of fluid rheology, flow rate, annulus dimensions, and eccentricity on velocity profile and frictional pressure losses in the annulus. Numerical results were compared with the available extensive experimental investigations on the flow of a variety of drilling fluids that have a strong shear-thinning property and high yield stress (e.g., polymer-based and bentonite fluids). The tests were implemented over a wide range of flow rates using a flow loop that is equipped with a pipe viscometer and several annular test sections with various sizes and eccentricities. Field observations, experimental data, and the analytical approach in this study indicate that increasing eccentricity lowers frictional pressure drop in the annulus. A good agreement was observed between the numerical-simulation results and experimental measurements. Comparison of the present and past studies with analytical solutions of Newtonian fluids in an eccentric annulus shows that the current study provides more-accurate results. Detailed numerical simulation and the equations that are presented in this study can be used by investigators. The application of the Cartesian and boundary-fitted coordinate systems and algebraic correlations for geometry transformations are presented. Moreover, the exact method of flow-rate calculation based on the velocities at each gridpoint is shown in the provided details. The application of findings in this study includes more-accurate predictions of velocity profile and frictional pressure loss in the annulus, which lead to better predictions of barite sag, cuttings transport, equivalent circulating density, and mud cement displacement in special cases of cementing operations.

First, sets of tests conducted with sharp non-chamfered cutters are analyzed. A decreasing trend between the friction angle and back rake angle is consistently observed. The reason can be attributed to a change in flow direction of the rock in front and near the cutting face. A linear relationship between the friction angle and cutter back rake angle is proposed. The coefficient of this relationship can be calculated using the rock internal friction angle and at least one drilling data for the given drilling fluid and contacting surfaces. Four sets of tests with cutters of different diameters (13 and 16 mm) and chamfer lengths (0.010 and 0.016 inch) were conducted. The test results are presented and analyzed using the abovementioned semi empirical model. The method is to associate a chamfered cutter's action to an equivalent non-chamfered cutter back rake angle. It is observed that applying the test data to this analysis produces results that make physical sense with the geometric shape of a chamfered cutter. Finally, contact stress data, for the range of back rake angles tested, confirm a strong increasing trend with back rake angle. The observations indicate that, for the conditions of these tests, that the frictional response of a cutter with developed wear flat is dominated by the wear flat friction itself. "

However, these methods provide us with a Poisson's ratio that is representative of only near-wellbore regions. In this paper, a technique is proposed by extending currently used pressure-transient-testing concepts to include reservoir stresses. More specifically, the interference well test is generalized to find not only conventional flow parameters such as reservoir transmissivity and storage capacity, but also the average in-situ Poisson's ratio. This is accomplished with the generalized diffusivity equation, which takes into account flow-induced stress changes. First, a generalized diffusivity equation is formulated by considering a deformable porous medium. The main goal of the generalized diffusivity equation is to extend current well-testing methods to include both fluid-flow and rock-mechanics aspects, and to present a way to determine the rock-mechanics-related property, Poisson's ratio, from the interference-well test. The line-source solution to the diffusivity equation is used to modify the current interference well-test technique. A synthetic example is presented to show the main steps of the proposed transient well-testing analysis technique. In addition, application of the proposed method is illustrated with interference-well-test field data. With a Monte Carlo simulation, effects of uncertainty in the input data on the prediction of Poisson's ratio are investigated, as well. In addition, a coupled fluid-flow/geomechanical simulation is performed to show the validity of the proposed formulation and corresponding improvement over the current analytical approach. One can put in practice an average in-situ value in different applications requiring accurate value of Poisson's ratio on the reservoir scale. Some examples of these include in-situ-stress-field determination, stress distribution and rock-mass deformation, and the next generation of coupled fluid-flow/geomechanical simulators. By use of Poisson's ratio that could capture flow-induced stress changes, we would be able to find the stress distribution caused by production/injection within the reservoir more precisely as well.

                    "abstract": "The phenomenon of settlement of weighting-material particles in drilling fluid is known as barite sag, which can lead to a number of drilling problems including lost circulation, well-control difficulties, poor cementing operation, and stuck pipe. This study investigates barite sag, both experimentally and numerically, in the annulus under flow conditions. Settlement of the weighting materials is generally called barite sag because barite is the most popular weight material used in drilling industry. The experimental part of the study has been conducted using a flow loop with 35-ft-long annulus test section to investigate the effects of fluid velocity in annulus, annulus eccentricity, pipe rotation, and inclination angle on barite sag. Density of the flowing fluid is measured continuously using Coriolis densitometers at the inlet and outlet of the annular test section. The simulation part of this study is based on a proposed particle- tracking method called “particle-elimination technique.” In this method, falling and axial velocities of the solid particles are estimated to predict their travelling paths. Density of the flowing fluid is updated, taking into account the number of particles that become stationary by reaching the casing wall. To model the downward motion of the barite bed on an inclined bed, the analogy of falling film of a viscous liquid on an inclined plane is applied. Velocity of the falling barite bed is calculated on the basis of an apparent viscosity approximated by the experiments. Knowing the velocity of the moving bed, the mass rate of barite downstream of the bed, which goes back into the main flow stream, is calculated and a new density for the moving fluid is achieved. The numerical simulation is modified from laboratory scale to real wellbore dimensions to be used for practical drilling applications. Results of the tests indicate that the highest sag occurs at low annular velocities, low rotational speeds, and high inclination angles. Barite-sag reduction caused by decreasing the inclination angle continues until the inclination-angle values are approximately 60 degrees, after which it becomes insignificant. Another observation made from experimental results and simulation work is that as the circulation of the drilling fluid in the loop continues, the fluid density decreases until it reaches an equilibrium stage. The equilibrium stage occurs faster for lower inclination angles. Effects of annular velocity and inner-pipe rotational speed on barite sag are similar; however, they are different from the trend observed when the inclination angle changes. Eccentricity of a nonrotating inner pipe did not have a significant effect on barite sag. However, the effect of inner-pipe rotation on barite sag for an eccentric annulus is more significant than in the concentric case. Comparing the results of numerical simulation with the experimental study shows a good agreement. The proposed simulation approach in this study can be used for barite-sag predictions in the annulus. A good prediction of the barite sag can prevent hazardous situations and would help engineers in drilling wells to spend less money and time. "

The separation of barite particles out of the drilling fluids causes a variety of problems, such as stuck pipe, lost circulation, and poor cement jobs. Furthermore, several severe well-controlled incidents have been caused by barite sag. This paper presents the quantitatively combined effects of the drilling parameters on dynamic barite sag in oil-based drilling fluids. The drilling parameters include annular velocity, pipe rotation, inclination angle, and eccentricity. Two levels for each parameter were considered to develop the test matrix in this study. For example, the parameter of inclination angle has two levels including concentric drill pipe (e=0) and eccentric drill pipe (e=1). The Barite Sag Flow Loop (BSFL), which utilized a coriolis mass flow meter to measure the circulating density of the fluid, was used to conduct tests. The Taguchi method was used to design the test matrix, which greatly reduces the number of experiments required and offers the optimum settings of the control parameters. Based on the two levels of the analyzed parameters, the annular velocity and pipe rotation contribute almost 60% and 21%, respectively, to the prevention of sag. The results also indicate that changing the inclination angle in the range from 60° to 45° from the vertical has the least impact on the prevention of barite sag. The results of this study enable drillers and designers to operate and design wells with fewer problems related to barite sag. "

Safe Salinity Window can be obtained from a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model, which incorporates drilling fluid-induced chemical osmotic in-situ stress. A multiple solute, non-ideal solution pore pressure transmission model is adopted in this study for accurately predicting the pore pressure term in a wellbore stability model. It has been found that both compressive failure index and tensile failure index are a function of pore pressure. It is also found that the salinity of drilling fluids will cause chemical osmotic pressure and further affect the effective principle stresses. Increasing salinity will decrease the chances of compressive failure but may move the drilled section closer to the tensile failure boundary. Mohr-Coulomb criterion gives more conservative salinity value to predict compressive failure than the prediction from Modified-Lade criterion.  1. INTRODUCTION  Problems with shale stability have plagued the drilling industry for more than fifty years. Based on conservative report, shale instability issues cost the oil and gas industry more than 6 billion U.S. dollars worldwide annually [1]. Common shale instability related problems include tight spots, stuck pipe, hole caving, lost circulation, wellbore breathing, high cementing cost, cementing failure, and total wellbore collapse. Although shale instability has been studied for many years, it remains one of the major drilling challenges for the oil and gas industry. Attempts to solve shale problems have largely been by trial and error, which results in high overall well costs and rig-time losses. Knowledge of pore pressure is critical for wellbore stability since it affects the effective principle stress. It is widely accepted that preventing pressure invasion into a shale matrix is an effective method for maintaining shale stability [2-6].  "

In terms of the experimental research, running tubular into horizontal wellbores was simulated with four different pipes, varying buoyancy and loading speed. Throughout the tests, axial loads both applied to the pipe and transmitted through the pipe were recorded simultaneously, with respect to pipe displacement. Experiments reveal that currently existing models give reasonable approximations as long as buoyancy is not included into the tests. The major interpretation from experiments is such that contrary to what currently existing expressions imply, i.e. tubular buckles immediately as effective weight approaches zero; even for naturally buoyant conditions, considerable amount of axial load is still required for both buckling initiation and helix formation. As buoyancy increases further, results and predictions diverge from each other considerably. In order to eliminate the discrepancies between results and predictions, theoretical study was conducted. Empirical correlations that also consider the influence of buoyancy on critical buckling loads are presented. Finally, another pipe was also tested within different buoyancy conditions to validate the equations developed. Experimental results of this pipe closely match the new analytical findings. This experimental and analytical study provides useful results for future applications with buoyancy assisted tubulars, in terms of practical engineering and design calculations.  Introduction Over the last two decades, extended and mega reach wells, followed by multilaterals, have been common practices through the industry because they provide multiple solutions for restricted reservoir production, such as reaching larger areas from one surface location and keeping the well in the reservoir through longer departures. These distinct advantages of such wells have opened up new opportunities for many operators to improve hydrocarbon recoveries in such a way that drilling and future intervention costs make sense. Consequently, the ERD envelope has expanded rapidly and more challenging operational considerations have been faced with. Although it is a straight forward and well understood operational practice for conventional wells, running long casing strings in extended or mega reach wells has emerged as one of the most challenging operations due to the increasing level of drag between casing and the wellbore as step-out ratios have increased by the help of emerging technologies. One idea to overcome the issue of drag encountered when running long casing strings and sliding drilling is to reduce the effective weight of tubular, consequently the contact force by the use of buoyancy. However, the shortcoming with flotation methodologies is such that the buckling resistance of buoyed tubular also tends to be low. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Reaming while drilling can be a more economical drilling technique than conventional drilling. Downhole failures can occur for a variety of reasons, and failure as a result of excess dynamic loading on the bottom hole assembly (BHA) components may be the most mysterious. One of those mysteries is the static and dynamic distribution of axial load between the bit and the reamer. This paper presents an approach using the explicit finite element method to model the static and dynamic interactions between the bit, the reamer and the formation of the BHA.  The results for axial displacement from the explicit finite element method are compared to theoretical results for a self-weighted column. Also, the axial vibrations are compared to the theoretical natural frequencies. Once the comparison showed the explicit FE method gives the same theoretical results, the model is expanded to better reflect actual downhole conditions. The model includes a bit and a reamer from which the interaction can be studied with an emphasis on axial loading. A weight dependent velocity boundary condition is used to model formation penetration of the bit and reamer. This models the relationship between the axial load on the reamer and the bit. This so-called drill-ahead model can be used to better understand the dynamics of the BHA.  Results from this study show the amplitude of the axial oscillating force on the reamer was greater than that of the force on the bit. Drilling with a more aggressive reamer will decrease the side forces on these components for the case studied. In addition, for a change of load at the top of the model, the reamer can take more of the transient load than the bit.  Introduction Simultaneous drilling and underreaming is a technique that opens a drilled pilot hole to a larger diameter for the installation of close tolerance casing strings and to insert and extract drilling assemblies. Because of excessive dynamic loading on the bottom hole assembly (BHA) components, downhole failures can occur. Therefore, to decrease the damage to these components and to increase the drilling efficiency, there is a need for a better understanding of the dynamic BHA interactions with the formation. If an adequate model can be built of the dynamic BHA behavior, then drilling engineers can study the effect of parameters including rate of penetration (ROP), weight on bit (WOB), weight on reamer (WOR), BHA configuration, inclination angle, and size of the pilot hole and reamed hole.  This paper provides a better understanding of the dynamics of BHAs by addressing axial loading for a BHA with a bit and reamer. The study of the statics and dynamics of the BHA included in this paper consists of modeling the lower part of the drillstring. Most failures occur in the BHA because of excessive loading and vibrations. The explicit finite element method implemented in Abaqus 6.10 was used for modeling the BHA. Explicit three dimensional, linear beam elements were used to model the neutral axis of the drill string. The finite element formulation also includes axial deformation. Each node has six degrees of freedom: axial displacement, two components of transverse displacement, and three rotations. These nodes are also attached to a connector element that models the wellbore.  The following sections provide: a literature review, a description of the model, comparison to closed form solutions, a description of a drill-ahead routine, results of the dynamic interactions in the BHA and, finally, some remarks about the results.

                    "abstract": "This paper identifies wellbore stability concerns caused by transient surge and swab pressures during deepwater drilling tripping and reaming operations. Wellbore stability analysis is presented that couples transient surge and swab wellbore pressure oscillations and in-situ stress field oscillations in the near wellbore (NWB) zone in deepwater drilling. Deepwater drilling is usually subjected to narrow drilling windows and significant wellbore pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming because of well depth. However, integration of transient surge and swab pressure analysis, and its effects on in-situ stress analysis around the wellbore, is rarely industry studied. A transient surge and swab model is developed by considering drillstring components, wellbore structure, formation elasticity, pipe elasticity, fluid compressibility, fluid rheology, etc. Real-time pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming are obtained. Based on geomechanical principles, in-situ stress around the wellbore is calculated by coupling transient wellbore pressure with surge and swab pressure, pore pressure, and original formation stress status to perform wellbore stability analysis. By applying the breakout failure and wellbore fracture failure in the analysis, a workflow is proposed to obtain the safe operating window for tripping and reaming processes. Based on this study, it is determined that the safe drilling operation window for wellbore stability consists of more than just fluid density. The oscillation magnitude of transient wellbore pressure can be larger than the friction pressure loss during normal circulation process. With the effect of surge and swab pressure, the safe operating window can become narrower than expected. Although it is stable and not a concern during a normal penetration process, the wellbore stability can become problematic. By using the methodology described, unnecessary breakouts and borehole failures during tripping and reaming can be avoided. This work can also be used in the next generation of drilling automation. This study provides insight into the integration of wellbore stability analysis and transient surge and swab pressure analysis, which is rarely discussed in the literature. It indicates that, when surge and swab pressure analysis is not carefully performed, the actual safe operating window can become narrower than originally predicted. "

                    "title": "Experimental Study of Reservoir Stress Path and Hysteresis during Depletion and Injection under Different Deformational Conditions",
                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: During production, pore pressure decreases as reservoir becomes increasingly depleted. Because of reduction in pore pressure, the far-field stresses change. Consequently, formation fracture pressure decreases and therefore the safe mud window becomes narrower. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to predict horizontal in-situ stress changes during production and injection. Most often, it is assumed that a reservoir deforms uniaxially and the overburden stress is constant during production and injection. However, measured stress paths in the lab under these conditions have large discrepancies with field stress measurements from fracturing tests. These discrepancies might be due to several factors such as scale effects, damaged cores, stress arching, and faulting contributions. However, we identified that another controlling parameter is the dominant boundary conditions in the reservoir. A test matrix is designed and several laboratory experiments are conducted on Caslegate sandstone specimens using a triaxial facility. The depletion and injection tests were performed under uniaxial-strain, plane-strain, generalized-plane-stress, and unconstrained conditions. According to the results, stress paths during pressure drawdown and build-up stages are different and a permanent stress change is observed during production and injection cycles in all boundary conditions. Interestingly, the permanent stress change is highest for those BC’s where the lateral deformation is permissible (e.g., plane strain, generalized plane stress, and unconstrained conditions). In fact, the stress changes during production are irrecoverable upon repressurization for these cases. According to results, depletion-induced horizontal stress changes under plane strain and unconstrained conditions are lower than generalized-plane-stress assumptions. The highest change in horizontal in-situ stress is for the case of uniaxial strain condition. 1. INTRODUCTION In-situ stresses in the reservoir control mechanical, petrophysical, and strength properties as wells as fracture pressure and deformational behavior of reservoir and surrounding formations (Teufel et al., 1991). Furthermore, conducting any wellbore and reservoir geomechanical analysis is significantly sensitive to the accuracy of in-situ stresses in the reservoir. Consequently, knowledge of in-situ stresses is critical for accurate prediction of reservoir response under various loading conditions. On the other hand, field measurement of in-situ stresses via fracturing tests during the life of reservoir reveal that the far field stresses change as the reservoir becomes increasingly depleted due to stress and pore pressure coupling (Teufel, 1991; Tuefel et al., 1996; Addis, 1997; Wu and Addis, 1998; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Chan and Zoback., 2002). Zoback (2007) pointed out that fracture initiation pressure (FIP) during a leak-off test is a strong function of in-situ stresses and also the fracture propagation pressure (FPP) is very close to the minimum horizontal stress. This implies that any changes of in-situ stresses will alter the fracture initiation pressure and fracture propagation pressure. Specifically, in oil and gas drilling industry, the changes in fracture pressure significantly affects the safe drilling margin and therefore improper design of mud weight without taking into account the changes of in-situ stresses will lead to loss circulation of drilling fluid and increasing Non-Productive-Time (NPT) of drilling operation. This is of special importance in deep-water wells, which the fracture pressure of reservoir is low even prior to depletion. Moreover, induced stress changes during production from or injection into reservoirs may cause sand production, casing collapse, compaction and subsidence, and reactivation of pre-existing faults and induced-seismicity (Segall, 1985, 1989; Morita et al., 1989; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Hillis, 2001; Holt et al., 2004; Lynch et al, 2013; Rafieepour et al, 2015, 2017). The earlier analytical solutions were based on the theory of poroelasticity. For example, Aadnoy (1991) developed the following equation for the horizontal stress change as a function of pore pressure (equation) This equation was obtained based on uniaxial strain assumption and relates the stress path to the Poisson's ratio and Biot-Willis coefficient. Consequently, the fracture initiation pressure after depletion changes as follows (equation) Similar derivations were developed by Addis (1997a) for transversely isotropic and Shahri et al. (2013) for orthotropic materials. "

                    "title": "How Far Can We Push the Boundary of Horizontal Drilling? A Rivalry Between Wellbore Friction and Drillpipe Buoyant Weight and Stiffness",
                    "abstract": "To estimate the maximum attainable reach for a horizontal wellbore one needs to investigate the rivalry between the amount of available driving force and the opposing frictional forces. As we provide more driving force through further slack-off, we are more likely to buckle the string and create large normal contact forces, which result in additional tangential frictional forces opposing the forward motion of the BHA. In other words, all the provided driving force will not be transmitted to the desired point (i.e. drillbit) along the string. The greater the stiffness of the drillpipe, the later it buckles and comes into contact with the wellbore wall to create additional normal forces. However, greater stiffness might come with greater weight, as is the case for Steel Drillpipe (SDP) compared to Titanium Drillpipe (TDP), Aluminum Drillpipe (ADP) and Composite Drillpipe (CDP). In this study a new approach for modeling the coupling between tangential frictional force and normal contact force between wellbore and helically-buckled drillstring is developed. The validity of the model is confirmed with experimental data available in the literature. The axial force transfer capability of drillstrings made of SDP, TDP, ADP and CDP are compared. For a limited amount of compressive force provided at the beginning of the horizontal section, different categories of pipes (in the horizontal section of the well) take on different configurations. In addition, along a drillstring some parts remain straight, while some parts buckle helically or sinusoidally. This makes different drillstrings transfer the same amount of provided load differently. In practice, we are able to supply a limited amount of compressive load close to the critical lock-up load in the vertical/slant section of the wellbore. Moreover, below a minimum weight on bit (WOB) drilling becomes impractical. After simultaneous consideration of different buckling modes along the entire drillstring, it is quantitatively shown under what condition ADP can be considered as a superior option over CDP to be used in the horizontal section; and why ADP and CDP have shown a remarkable increase (almost two to three times larger) in the attainable horizontal reach compared to TDP and SDP. This article helps drilling engineers to design an optimum hybrid drillstring for ultra-extended-reach-wells. "

                    "abstract": "Accurate formation pore pressure prediction is the most important requirement for safe and effective drilling. It essentially contributes to the reduction of drilling risks and provides cost-effective drilling of wells. Even though there are methods that rely on well logs, seismic data and effective stress models to predict pore pressure, there is no model available for real-time pore pressure prediction ahead of the bit. This study explains how to design and apply a steady-state Kalman filter to predict real-time formation pore pressure optimally by combining outputs from both Eaton's model and from Logging While Drilling (LWD). The objectives of this study are to minimize the noise on pore pressure predicted from well logs (or LWD) measurements and to compute the next estimate of pore pressure ahead of bit using only the most recent measurement. Data obtained from well logs usually have noise measurements. The noise measurements lead to changes of the results acquired from well logs. Therefore, uncertainties occur on the estimated pore pressure. The designed Kalman filter is a recursive data processing algorithm to produce optimal estimate of pore pressure ahead of the drill bit. The estimates tend to be more refined than those based on measurements from well logs alone. First, Eaton's method, which is one of the most widely used pore pressure prediction methods, was modeled and represented in the state-space form required for Kalman Filter modeling. Parameters used in the Kalman Filter algorithm were also identified in state-space form. A computer code to implement the designed Kalman filter algorithm has been developed. Additionally, field data were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Based on the results, it is concluded that Kalman filter can be a very effective tool for detecting overpressure zones to avoid drilling problems before entering such zones. The most important achievement is that the developed algorithm can be used as a design tool in offshore and onshore drilling operations along with real-time LWD data to optimally estimate the formation pore pressure of the next interval ahead of the bit during the drilling operation.

                    "abstract": "In the completion of oil and gas wells, successful cementing operations essentially require the complete removal of the drilling mud and its substitution by the cement slurry. Therefore, the displacement of one fluid by another one is a crucial task that should be designed and optimized properly to ensure the zonal isolation and integrity of the cement sheath. Proper cementing jobs ensure safety, while poor displacements lead to multiple problems, including environmental aspects such as contamination of fresh water bearings. There are a number of factors, such as physical properties of fluids, geometrical specifications of the annulus, flow regime, and flow rate, which can remarkably affect the displacement efficiency. The shape of the interface plays an influential role during the displacement process. For a highly efficient displacement the interface has to be as flat and stable as possible. However, unstable and elongated interfaces are associated with channeling phenomenon, excessive mixing, cement contamination, and consequently unsuccessful cementing operations. Thus, the stability of the interface between the two fluids has major importance in cementing applications. In the present work, a novel method for the prediction of interface instability and displacement efficiency is introduced. Instability analyses of the interface between the two fluids are carried out following the main ideas of the original Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Moreover, using the same analyses, optimized designs for improvement of the displacement process in any specific situation are proposed. The influence of density, rheological properties, surface tension, and flow rate of the fluids on the instability and shape of the interface, and consequently on the displacement efficiency, is studied. Furthermore, an analytical solution of the displacement of fluids in the annular space that enables the calculation of the mixed volumes is developed. Additional time-dependent considerations are made for the calculations of cases with unstable interfaces. For the same cases studied, 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed, using commercially available CFD software. For the purpose of validation of the results, a number of experiments were conducted for fluids with various combinations of physical properties. The results present the effect of physical fluid properties, geometrical configurations, and flow rate on the instability of the interface and displacement efficiency. Reasonably good agreement between the results of all three approaches presented in the paper are observed and they all emphasize the importance of the proper selection of fluid properties and flow rates for any specific sequence, to minimize the degree of contamination and mixing. The discussions and results of this work provide insight into displacement process, invaluable guidelines for industrial applications, and compelling evidence of the importance of correct predictions and appropriate designs of the displacement of fluids in cementing operations.

                    "abstract": "One of the major challenges of oil industry is to predict the in-situ stress field accurately. Accordingly, different techniques have been developed to predict the reservoir stress field in the past decades. Inversion Technique is a powerful method which was developed to determine the minimum and maximum horizontal stress components and their direction using fracturing data, i.e., leak-off tests or mini-fracture tests, by solving an over-constrained system of equations. As compared to other indirect methods, the actual fracturing data is used in this technique to back calculate the stress field. In this paper, a new feature is added that enable us to determine the stress field using the data gathered during the production history of reservoir. In this approach, the effect of pore pressure changes on the reservoir stresses is incorporated into the Inversion Technique using constitutive equations of orthotropic rock model. Using the proposed technique, minimum and maximum horizontal stress components can be determined corresponding to different pore pressure during the reservoir life. According to the field data, the new formulation increases the prediction accuracy when fracturing data is gathered corresponding to different pore pressure. The proposed approach can be used for more accurate well design applications during the life of reservoir. Introduction It is critical for the oil industry to know the stress field within a reservoir for well-designing issues. In most cases, the stress field is non-hydrostatic, which means all principle stresses have different values. Usually, two minimum and maximum horizontal stress components are assumed in the reservoirs where the overburden stress can be obtained from density logs. Hubbert and Willis (1957) investigated the hydraulic fracturing mechanism and its relation to the in-situ stress field. According to their results, the direction of hydraulically-induced fracture is perpendicular to the least principle stress. Consequently, there is a relationship between in-situ stress field and induced hydraulic fractures. The direct measurement of minimum horizontal stress can be done using fracturing tests, such as leak-off tests or mini-fracture tests. However, if non-equal horizontal stresses exist, there is no method available for direct measurement of maximum horizontal stress. Indirect techniques based on core measurements have been attempted, such as differential strain curve analysis (Strickland and Ren 1980, Ren and Roegiers 1983) and differential wave velocity analysis, but have not gained widespread use. Several authors investigated the determination of stress field from the failure of inclined holes. Aadnoy (1990a, b) proposed an Inversion Technique to determine the horizontal principle stress components and their direction using available fracturing data from deviated wells. The leak-off test data, pore pressure, overburden stress and well configuration were used to determine the stress field. In principle, one needs only two sets of fracturing data in order to use this technique. However, the in-situ stress field can be determined using more fracturing data by solving an overdetermined system of equations. Induced fracture traces resulting from borehole fracturing operations were used in the analysis of the in-situ stress field, as well. Gjonnes et al. (1998) improved the Inversion Technique by taking into account the effect of shear stress components that were neglected before. Okabe et al. (1998) proposed a method to determine the in-situ stress field using the data collected from a single inclined borehole. The method can be used for a reverse-faulting regime and for drilling-induced fractures arranged en-echelon in inclined holes. The fracture directions must be read reliably using Formation Micro Imager (FMI) or Borehole Televiewer (BHTV). "

                    "abstract": "Drilling of extended reach wells (ERW) and ultra-deep HPHT wells is the most compelling reason for drilling companies to look for alternative drill pipes that meet their requirements. Currently, with the emergence of drill pipes made of materials other than steel, a thorough study of their advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional drill pipes is needed. In this study the main focus is on the comparison of fatigue performance of Steel Drillpipe (SDP), Aluminum Drillpipe (ADP), and Titanium Drillpipe (TDP) in mild and severe doglegs. Fatigue performances of different drillpipes are compared and it is shown that depending on the drillpipe specification, applied torque, axial load and Dogleg Severity (DLS) of the wellbore, one type can functions better than others and a one-size-fits-all is not an appropriate approach on the selection of drillpipe material. Generated contact forces at the tool joints and pipe body adds more complexity to decide which type of drillpipe is more appropriate for drilling a severe dogleg. The contact forces at the tool joints and pipe body could be an extremely important factor owing to their direct impact on the wellbore stability, casing and pipe body wear and the heat checking of the tool joints. Large contact forces at the pipe body can make relatively major scratches on the surface of the pipe tube of ADP and TDP which can render their corrosion resistance features insignificant. Based on the conducted study, TDP has a significantly good fatigue resistance even at the simultaneous presence of high applied torque and axial load and severe doglegs which makes the usage of other options (SDP and ADP) impractical from the fatigue failure standpoint. It is shown that the limiting factor for using TDP in such severe conditions is not the fatigue resistance of the material that the pipe is made of, but the high contact forces between the wellbore/casing wall and tool-joints/pipe-tube. The fatigue envelopes and calculated contact forces for each category of drillpipes reveal the practical range of the applied torque and axial load both to avoid suffering from fatigue failure and not to be detrimental to the wellbore integrity. This paper can help drilling engineers to design an optimal drillstring for ERD and complex wells. "

As in conventional cementing operations, cement plug setting requires an efficient fluid displacement process to be considered \"successful.\" Due to the nature of the operation, i.e., displacing one fluid with another inside a tubular, mixing of the fluids during this process is inevitable, because the fluids are in contact via a contacting interface. The stability of this interface depends on many parameters, such as flow rate, pipe size, inclination, displacing and displaced fluid rheological properties, as well as densities, interfacial tension between the fluids, etc. Therefore, an optimization process is required to minimize the mixing and thus to maximize the quality of the cement plug to be set by controlling the physical properties of the displacing fluid. In this study, the displacement process of one fluid with another inside circular pipes is investigated analytically and experimentally. Analytical work includes a simplified mathematical model that can predict the structure of the interface between the displacing and displaced fluid. The model allows determination of the mixed volume during the flow. In addition, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the mixed volume are conducted using a commercial software. During the experimental work, different combinations of fluids with specified rheological properties and densities are compared based on the extent of displacement and mixing in circular pipes at different flow rates using The University of Tulsa – Displacement and Mixing Facility. Analytical modeling, experimental tests, and CFD simulations all indicate that significant mixing takes place during a displacement process, and even in a \"successful\" case, 15% by volume of the cement plug is contaminated by the displacing fluid. If the physical properties of the displacing fluid are not optimized, this contaminated volume becomes more than 50% of the total volume of the cement plug. This level of mixing will result in failure of the set plug's function. The study also shows that rheological properties and density of the displacing fluid significantly influence the displacement efficiency, which can be used as an optimization tool for reducing / minimizing the mixed volume during the displacement process. The quality of the primary cementing and cement plug setting processes directly depends on minimization of the mixed volume. This is not only a safety issue, it can also result in serious environmental impacts, such as contamination of the water table. The information obtained from this study can be used as to establish guidelines for the optimization of displacing fluid properties that result in successful primary cementing and cement plug setting.

This research develops a better insight into synthetic fluid rheology based on the theory of internal structural units (SUs) suspensions. Although different studies have been proposed to characterize SBF rheology, yield stress and time dependency proved difficult to determine. This study explains how most difficulties disappear when taking thixotropy into account. The behavior of structural units and effective volume fractions as a function of shear rate, has been analyzed by Qemada (1998) to develop a rheological model for particles suspension. This rheological model has been modified to describe the behavior of SBFs. For validation purposes, an industrial SBF used for drilling in a shale reservoir is analyzed. A novel experimental procedure is proposed that makes extensive use of rotational rheometers to estimate the parameters of the model. Various combinations of temperatures and resting times have been tested to develop semi-empirical correlations for the model parameters. In addition, a practical use of the model is demonstrated by accurately estimating the settling of retrieved shale cuttings through the analyzed synthetic fluid. The experimental protocol represents a design tool for onshore and offshore drilling operations that involve SBFs, with potential improvements on optimization of flow systems and cuttings transport efficiency.

                    "abstract": "A successful cement placement can provide zonal isolation and environmental safety. Effective design of cement placement and mud removal impact all the stages of the wellbore life from drilling ahead to production. Accurate predictions of fluid displacement in the wellbore are vital to design fluid properties and plan the cementing job. In this work, an analytical model is developed to simulate the displacement of fluids in eccentric annuli. This paper presents a novel method for the solution of cement/mud displacement and evaluation of inter-fluid contamination during displacement for eccentric annuli. This new approach starts by addressing the problem of single fluid flow in eccentric annuli by solving analytically the governing transport equations for a flow inside an unwrapped annulus. The solution is, then, extended to a system of two fluids in a vertical annulus by adjusting the boundary conditions for displacement. The model is completed by adding the time-dependent calculation of interface between the two fluids, enabling the accurate determination of the amount of mixing and displacement efficiency. The analytical method proposed is used to simulate single and multi-fluid flows and study the effect of fluid properties of cement, spacer, and drilling mud at different flow rates on displacement efficiency, for both concentric and eccentric, vertical annuli. 3-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were also performed and the results were compared to the analytical solution. Moreover, instability of the interface in all the cases was studied and the analysis offers an understanding of the role of fluid properties and proposes applicable optimized design to enhance the displacements. The amount of mixing and contamination that occurs during the displacement was calculated for both methods. The analytical solution and CFD produce results within a 13% difference, which validates the analytical model. Evidence was gathered to support that the improper design of fluid properties and flow rate along with a highly eccentric annulus can lead to substantial cement contamination. This may lead to under-designing the amount of fluids to be pumped to provide a complete mud removal and an efficient cement placement. On the other hand, learnings and models developed allow optimizing fluid properties that may lead to best outcomes even for highly eccentric annulus. The undeniable importance of a complete cement displacement is addressed by means of an analytical solution of the displacement, which provides a realistic prediction of the amount of inter-fluid mixing and cement contamination. This approach coupled with the interface instability analysis, which offers improvement techniques for the displacement, provide beneficial enhancements for practical industrial applications. "

                    "abstract": "Fracture-based wellbore strengthening techniques are preventive methods that can reduce the cost of lost circulation and non-productive time. The mud weight window can be extended by plugging fractures with wellbore strengthening materials (WSM) in the near-wellbore region. To maximize the strengthening effect, accurate fracture geometry prediction is of critical importance to the design of WSM. This paper presents a novel, coupled fluid flow and fracture mechanics model for wellbore strengthening applications that accounts for near-wellbore-induced fracture behavior. For fluid flow, mass conservation is considered and momentum conservation is examined; the latter shows that pressure loss with near-wellbore fracturing is low. Thus, we can neglect the pressure drop in the fractures and assume the fluid pressure inside the fractures is equal to the wellbore pressure. The pressure-width relationship (rock elastic deformation) and stress intensity factor are obtained by a dislocation-based approach. For the fracture propagation criterion, the calculated stress intensity factor is compared with fracture toughness at each time step. The stress intensity factor and fracture reopening pressure (FROP) are verified with Tada's model and Feng's model, respectively. Then, simulation results are compared with the large leak-off solutions of the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) fracture model. The simulation results reveal that the PKN model overestimates the fracture mouth width, fracture length, and wellbore pressure. Furthermore, the simulation results of wellbore pressure show a different trend. Therefore, we cannot directly use the PKN model to design wellbore strengthening applications. The main reason is the presence of wellbore can generate near-wellbore effects that cannot be disregarded. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive parametric study (i.e., fracture toughness, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, horizontal stress ratio, and permeability) on wellbore strengthening fracturing. The proposed model is useful for wellbore strengthening applications using the intentionally induced fractures (i.e., near-wellbore fracturing). Particle size distribution (PSD) of WSM can be designed based on the simulated fracture geometry. No complex model mesh generation or assignment of boundary conditions are needed, which are commonly used in finite element simulation or other numerical methods. The proposed model can also be used to optimize wellbore strengthening operations by performing sensitivity analysis. "

                    "abstract": "A unified transient model is presented for predictions of flow pattern transitions, pressure gradient, solid particle concentration in solid-liquid two-phase flow. The transient mechanistic model is based on the conservation of mass and momentum and coupled with flow pattern prediction methods. Changes of flow patterns are reflected by assigning certain terms to zeros in the general equations and changing the number of equations. Thus, the model can be automatically adjusted for flow patterns in transient simulation. A semi-implicit approach is used to solve the model. The velocities and pressures are solved implicitly based on the momentum conservation equations and the solids concentrations are updated explicitly based on the mass conservation equations. The model is validated by conducting a series of experimental tests on a full scale flow loop (0.2 × 0.11 × 25 m). The validation of the transient simulation includes the validation of the transient build-up stage and the validation of the cuttings volumetric concentration at fully developed stage. Results found that increase of the flow rate significantly reduces the build-up time, and effects of pipe rotation vary at different inclined angles. The effect of inclination angle on solids profile build-up is similar to the effects of well inclination angle on steady state cuttings concentration. Below 60°, the build-up time increases significantly as the well inclination angle increases. When the well inclination angle goes to over 60°, the effects of well inclination angle become insignificant. "

                    "abstract": "Cutting rock in pressurized conditions is essentially different as compared to the ambient conditions. Under pressurized condition, cutter is not only fragmenting the rock matrix, but also driving pore fluid to flow forward. Due to the coupling of stresses and pore pressure, the pore pressure change caused by cutter will affect effective stresses in the rock and eventually affect mechanical specific energy (MSE). The change in stresses and pore pressure caused by cutter movement are the poroelastic effects in cutting process. To study pressurized cutting process, we developed a cutting model based on the theory of linear poroelasticity. The model can predict coupled stresses and pore pressure in the rock and give a better understanding of the poroelastic effect in the cutting process. To obtain the desired solution, a Fourier Transform is employed. After the analytic solution in Fourier space is obtained, a Discrete Fourier Transform is employed to numerically invert the solution back to the real space. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is also introduced to determine failure of the rock ahead of the cutter. Eventually, the model can predict cutting forces and MSE in pressurized cutting process. The model is also compared to the published experimental data and a good consistency between model and experiment results was found. The influence of hydrostatic pressure and the existence of cuttings on MSE are studied and poroelastic effect during cutting process is also discussed. The results in this paper can be applied to bit-rock interaction in well drilling. "

Drillstring configuration and motion can play a significant role on the pressure profile in the annulus. Eccentricity, rotation and axial position of the drillstring can cause distinct pressure losses. If an accurate prediction is desired, these effects need to be accounted for. In this study, the pressure losses of Yield Power Law fluids with various drillstring rotation speeds and configurations are analyzed. These configurations include eccentricity and various buckling configurations and rotation speeds of the drillstring. Neural networks are used to predict the pressure losses and the results are compared with the experimental results and existing models from the literature. The input to the neural networks is optimized by comparing using direct measurements and using dimensionless parameters derived from the measurements. The comparison shows that using direct measurements as input yield better results instead of using dimensionless parameters, considering the experimental data used in this study. The results of this study showed that using neural networks to predict the pressure losses in complex geometries and motion showed a better precision compared to the existing models from the literature. The results analysis show that predicting with neural networks can yield as low as 5% absolute average percent error while predicting using existing models can yield as high as 115% absolute average percent error. Using neural networks shows a strong potential to accurately predict the pressure losses especially considering complex fluids and geometries. "

                    "abstract": "The risk of gas hydrate formation is one of the major concerns for offshore flow assurance. Solutions of methanol (MeOH) and mono-ethylene-glycol (MEG) are most often employed as thermodynamic inhibitors (THI) to prevent the formation of hydrate plugs. This study involves experimental and modeling work to investigate and compare the suitability and effectiveness of methanol and MEG on inhibiting and displacing the water in jumper type configurations during flushing procedures. Numerical analysis aims to investigate the mixing and displacing mechanisms that occur during jumper flushing to optimize key factors such as the position of the injection port and the flowrate of a required chemical inhibitor. This paper presents the experimental results with respect to effect of inhibitor type, injection rate, brine salinity and liquid loading. All experiments were carried out in a 3\" jumper system at The University of Tulsa. Simulations using 1D transient multiphase flow simulator were conducted to evaluate its capacity to predict the thermodynamic inhibitor dispersion by using the inhibitor tracking module. The 3D computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed with the commercial software to help predict the amount and flowrates of chemicals required, and to serve optimizing the location of injection ports. Comparisons were made between the simulation results and experimental data from full fresh water loading jumper displacement tests with MEG and methanol. From the experiments, several conclusions are drawn. Different dispersion and partitioning mechanisms were observed for methanol and MEG through experiments, especially in the vertical sections and low spots of the jumper. Methanol overriding the water phase at horizontal low spots was captured for the low velocity experimental cases, leaving a large amount of water behind that could result in under-inhibited situations. For the 12% brine tests, less water was displaced for each MEG injection rate, whereas a better mixing of methanol with brine was measured. The 1D and 3D simulations provided reasonable prediction for THI distribution along the jumper after displacement tests, except that neither was able to reproduce methanol overriding the water phase at both low spots. 3D CFD simulations results obtained generally gave better agreement with the results from the experiment. This study provides a better understanding of the displacement and mixing mechanisms of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors. It helps operators minimize operational risks, reducing the size of the umbilical and decreasing capital costs related to equipment and chemicals. "

Wellbore strengthening has been successfully applied to reduce the associated cost and increased the wellbore stability in the industry over the past two decades. It is of critical importance to accurately predict the extra drilling mud weight after wellbore strengthening. However, previous research assumed fixed boundary conditions and only considered the stress intensity factor in the calculation of fracture reopening pressure (FROP). The change of pressure boundary on the fracture surfaces was ignored, which may overestimate the FROP. This paper employed a dislocation-based fracture model to determine the FROP in wellbore strengthening. The proposed model is compared with finite element simulation. An excellent match is obtained for the fracture profile and a clear inflection point can be observed between the plugged zone and unplugged zone. We present how wellbore pressure can change the pressure boundary in the model. Thus, the FROP calculation should be modified with the consideration of fracture plug width. Results show that the fracture plugged zone pressure can affect the fracture profile. Specifically, lower fracture plugged zone pressure results in higher FROP. Thus, better wellbore strengthening can be achieved in the depleted sections during drilling. On the other hand, the fracture plug width plays an important role in determining FROP. With a fixed fracture plug location, larger fracture plug width can lead to higher FROP. However, there exists a critical fracture plug width for the maximum FROP, which is the value predicted by the previous research. The study reveals the importance of fracture plugged zone pressure and fracture plug width for FROP in wellbore strengthening. The model is useful for the design of wellbore strengthening materials (WSM), which are critical to achieve the best wellbore strengthening effects. "

                    "abstract": "In the completion of oil and gas wells, successful cementing operations essentially require the complete removal of the drilling mud and its substitution by the cement slurry. Therefore, the displacement of one fluid by another one is a crucial task that should be designed and optimized properly to guarantee the zonal isolation and integrity of the cement sheath. Proper cementing jobs ensure safety, whereas poor displacements lead to multiple problems, including environmental aspects such as the contamination of freshwater-bearing zones. There are a number of factors, such as physical properties of fluids, geometrical specifications of the annulus, flow regime, and flow rate, that can remarkably affect the displacement efficiency. The shape of the interface plays an influential role during the displacement process. For a highly efficient displacement, the interface has to be as flat and stable as possible. However, unstable and elongated interfaces are associated with channeling phenomena, excessive mixing, cement contamination, and, consequently, unsuccessful cementing operations. Thus, the stability of the interface between the two fluids has major importance in cementing applications. In the present work, a novel method for the prediction of interface instability and displacement efficiency is introduced. Instability analyses of the interface between the two fluids are carried out following the main ideas of the original Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Moreover, with the same analyses, optimized designs for the improvement of the displacement process in any specific situation can be proposed. The influence of density, rheological properties, surface tension, and flow rate of the fluids on the instability and shape of the interface, and consequently on the displacement efficiency, is studied. The 3D-computational-fluid- dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with commercially available CFD software to study several displacement cases. To validate the results, numerous experiments were conducted for fluids with various combinations of physical properties and operational conditions. For one of the inefficient displacement cases, an optimized design is provided on the basis of a study of the instability of the interface, and the improvements are validated by CFD simulations. The results present the effect of fluid properties, geometrical configurations, and flow rate on the instability of the interface and displacement efficiency. A reasonably good agreement between the results of all approaches presented in the paper is observed, and they all emphasize the importance of the proper selection of fluid properties and flow rates for any specific sequence—to minimize the degree of contamination and mixing. The discussions and results of this work provide insight into the displacement process, beneficial guidelines for industrial applications, and compelling evidence of the importance of correct predictions and appropriate designs of the displacement of fluids in cementing operations.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: During production, pore pressure decreases as reservoir becomes increasingly depleted. Because of reduction in pore pressure, the far-field stresses change. Consequently, formation fracture pressure decreases and therefore the safe mud window becomes narrower. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to predict horizontal in-situ stress changes during production and injection. Most often, it is assumed that a reservoir deforms uniaxially and the overburden stress is constant during production and injection. However, measured stress paths in the lab under these conditions have large discrepancies with field stress measurements from fracturing tests. These discrepancies might be due to several factors such as scale effects, damaged cores, stress arching, and faulting contributions. However, we identified that another controlling parameter is the dominant boundary conditions in the reservoir. A test matrix is designed and several laboratory experiments are conducted on Caslegate sandstone specimens using a triaxial facility. The depletion and injection tests were performed under uniaxial-strain, plane-strain, generalized-plane-stress, and unconstrained conditions. According to the results, stress paths during pressure drawdown and build-up stages are different and a permanent stress change is observed during production and injection cycles in all boundary conditions. Interestingly, the permanent stress change is highest for those BC’s where the lateral deformation is permissible (e.g., plane strain, generalized plane stress, and unconstrained conditions). In fact, the stress changes during production are irrecoverable upon repressurization for these cases. According to results, depletion-induced horizontal stress changes under plane strain and unconstrained conditions are lower than generalized-plane-stress assumptions. The highest change in horizontal in-situ stress is for the case of uniaxial strain condition. 1. INTRODUCTION In-situ stresses in the reservoir control mechanical, petrophysical, and strength properties as wells as fracture pressure and deformational behavior of reservoir and surrounding formations (Teufel et al., 1991). Furthermore, conducting any wellbore and reservoir geomechanical analysis is significantly sensitive to the accuracy of in-situ stresses in the reservoir. Consequently, knowledge of in-situ stresses is critical for accurate prediction of reservoir response under various loading conditions. On the other hand, field measurement of in-situ stresses via fracturing tests during the life of reservoir reveal that the far field stresses change as the reservoir becomes increasingly depleted due to stress and pore pressure coupling (Teufel, 1991; Tuefel et al., 1996; Addis, 1997; Wu and Addis, 1998; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Chan and Zoback., 2002). Zoback (2007) pointed out that fracture initiation pressure (FIP) during a leak-off test is a strong function of in-situ stresses and also the fracture propagation pressure (FPP) is very close to the minimum horizontal stress. This implies that any changes of in-situ stresses will alter the fracture initiation pressure and fracture propagation pressure. Specifically, in oil and gas drilling industry, the changes in fracture pressure significantly affects the safe drilling margin and therefore improper design of mud weight without taking into account the changes of in-situ stresses will lead to loss circulation of drilling fluid and increasing Non-Productive-Time (NPT) of drilling operation. This is of special importance in deep-water wells, which the fracture pressure of reservoir is low even prior to depletion. Moreover, induced stress changes during production from or injection into reservoirs may cause sand production, casing collapse, compaction and subsidence, and reactivation of pre-existing faults and induced-seismicity (Segall, 1985, 1989; Morita et al., 1989; Santarelli et al., 1998; Hettema, 2000; Hillis, 2001; Holt et al., 2004; Lynch et al, 2013; Rafieepour et al, 2015, 2017). The earlier analytical solutions were based on the theory of poroelasticity. For example, Aadnoy (1991) developed the following equation for the horizontal stress change as a function of pore pressure (equation) This equation was obtained based on uniaxial strain assumption and relates the stress path to the Poisson's ratio and Biot-Willis coefficient. Consequently, the fracture initiation pressure after depletion changes as follows (equation) Similar derivations were developed by Addis (1997a) for transversely isotropic and Shahri et al. (2013) for orthotropic materials. "

The pinpointing of the zones of loss allows the treatments to be applied directly to the points of loss rather than to the entire open hole. This paper presents an approach to predict the location of single loss zone in a vertical well by interpreting the transient mud circulating temperature profiles altered by mud loss. The fluid flow and heat transfer numerical model in estimating the transient mud circulating temperature profiles during a lost circulation event was developed. The temperature profile in both the flow conduits (drillpipe and annulus) were modeled using mass and energy balances. The flow rate of drilling mud decreases in the annulus above the loss zone as part of the fluids lost into the fractures, which in turn alters the heat transmission status between the drillpipe, annulus, and near-wellbore formation. The wellbore is divided into two sections, which accounts for single loss zone. Case studies were performed and numerical solution results were presented and analyzed. According to the results, alterations induced by mud loss include: 1) Declines in both annular mud temperature and drillpipe mud temperature over time, and 2) Discontinuity in the first order derivative of annular mud temperature with respect to depth at the location of loss. By matching the simulated results with the distributed temperature measurements at different time stamps, the depth of the loss zone can be identified. "

                    "abstract": "Traditional water based fluids tend to penetrate into shale formations, and interact with clay minerals, which results in clay swelling and wellbore instability. The larger content of clay in some deep water shales compared to regular onshore shales generates more wellbore instability problems. To reduce shale-fluid interaction, we need to reduce water invasion by sealing the pores and micro-fractures in shales. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to conduct pore pressure transmission (PPT) tests with test fluids that contain two new families of nanoparticles and to evaluate the major factors that affect pore pressure transmission. For the first time, Mancos Shale and Eagle Ford Shale have been investigated with PPT tests using fluids that contain nanoparticles in different sizes (10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, 40 nm), types (aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide) and concentrations (3%, 10%). Results show that nanoparticles of 10 nm size can delay the time needed to reach the equilibrium state to 48.2 hours, compared to 27.8 hours needed for Eagle Ford Shale treated with suspensions that contain 40 nm nanoparticles. Based on the test matrix, the better combinations to decrease pore pressure at the equilibrium state are 10% 10 nm Al2O3 for Eagle Ford Shale and 10% 30 nm Al2O3 for Mancos Shale. This relatively new plugging technique using nanoparticles has great practical potential for successful application in deep water drilling. A decrease in pore pressure transmission and the delay of the time to reach the equilibrium state will reduce problems of hydration and swelling in shale formations. This study can also help to define water based drilling fluid properties for the purpose of improving wellbore stability in deep water drilling. "

                    "abstract": "Cement plugs are used for various reasons in wellbores, including control of lost circulation zones, initiation of deviation or side tracking, wellbore abandonment, and more. Unfortunately, one of the most questionable processes during the drilling and completion stage of a wellbore is the quality of the cementing job. As in conventional cementing operations, cement plug setting requires an efficient fluid displacement process to be considered \"successful.\" Due to the nature of the operation, i.e., displacing one fluid with another inside a tubular, mixing of the fluids during this process is inevitable, because the fluids are in contact via a contacting interface. The stability of this interface depends on many parameters, such as flow rate, pipe size, inclination, displacing and displaced fluid rheological properties, as well as densities, interfacial tension between the fluids, etc. Therefore, an optimization process is required to minimize the mixing and thus to maximize the quality of the cement plug to be set by controlling the physical properties of the displacing fluid. In this study, the displacement process of one fluid with another inside circular pipes is investigated analytically and experimentally. Analytical work includes a simplified mathematical model that can predict the structure of the interface between the displacing and displaced fluid. The model allows determination of the mixed volume during the flow. In addition, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulations of the mixed volume are conducted using a commercial software. During the experimental work, different combinations of fluids with specified rheological properties and densities are compared based on the extent of displacement and mixing in circular pipes at different flow rates using The University of Tulsa – Displacement and Mixing Facility. Analytical modeling, experimental tests, and CFD simulations all indicate that significant mixing takes place during a displacement process, and even in a \"successful\" case, 15% by volume of the cement plug is contaminated by the displacing fluid. If the physical properties of the displacing fluid are not optimized, this contaminated volume becomes more than 50% of the total volume of the cement plug. This level of mixing will result in failure of the set plug's function. The study also shows that rheological properties and density of the displacing fluid significantly influence the displacement efficiency, which can be used as an optimization tool for reducing / minimizing the mixed volume during the displacement process. The quality of the primary cementing and cement plug setting processes directly depends on minimization of the mixed volume. This is not only a safety issue, it can also result in serious environmental impacts, such as contamination of the water table. The information obtained from this study can be used as to establish guidelines for the optimization of displacing fluid properties that result in successful primary cementing and cement plug setting.

                    "abstract": "In the completion of oil and gas wells, successful cementing operations essentially require the complete removal of the drilling mud and its substitution by the cement slurry. Therefore, the displacement of one fluid by another one is a crucial task that should be designed and optimized properly to ensure the zonal isolation and integrity of the cement sheath. Proper cementing jobs ensure safety, while poor displacements lead to multiple problems, including environmental aspects such as contamination of fresh water bearings. There are a number of factors, such as physical properties of fluids, geometrical specifications of the annulus, flow regime, and flow rate, which can remarkably affect the displacement efficiency. The shape of the interface plays an influential role during the displacement process. For a highly efficient displacement the interface has to be as flat and stable as possible. However, unstable and elongated interfaces are associated with channeling phenomenon, excessive mixing, cement contamination, and consequently unsuccessful cementing operations. Thus, the stability of the interface between the two fluids has major importance in cementing applications. In the present work, a novel method for the prediction of interface instability and displacement efficiency is introduced. Instability analyses of the interface between the two fluids are carried out following the main ideas of the original Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Moreover, using the same analyses, optimized designs for improvement of the displacement process in any specific situation are proposed. The influence of density, rheological properties, surface tension, and flow rate of the fluids on the instability and shape of the interface, and consequently on the displacement efficiency, is studied. Furthermore, an analytical solution of the displacement of fluids in the annular space that enables the calculation of the mixed volumes is developed. Additional time-dependent considerations are made for the calculations of cases with unstable interfaces. For the same cases studied, 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed, using commercially available CFD software. For the purpose of validation of the results, a number of experiments were conducted for fluids with various combinations of physical properties. The results present the effect of physical fluid properties, geometrical configurations, and flow rate on the instability of the interface and displacement efficiency. Reasonably good agreement between the results of all three approaches presented in the paper are observed and they all emphasize the importance of the proper selection of fluid properties and flow rates for any specific sequence, to minimize the degree of contamination and mixing. The discussions and results of this work provide insight into displacement process, invaluable guidelines for industrial applications, and compelling evidence of the importance of correct predictions and appropriate designs of the displacement of fluids in cementing operations.

                    "abstract": "Abstract: One way to reduce wellbore instability in shales is to use chemical agents, including nanomaterials, capable of sealing pores and micro-fractures. The main objective of this study is to develop an approach to conduct triaxial tests on cuttings-size (up to 1-in.) samples, including shales. Triaxial tests were conducted on Mancos Shale and Eagle Ford Shale, after Pore Pressure Transmission (PPT) tests with nanoparticles of different sizes (10, 40 nm), concentrations (3%, 10%), and types (aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide). Because the samples were too short (0.25-in. height x 1-in. diameter) for triaxial testing, special loading cases and innovative calculation methods were developed to generate stress-strain curves. The superior combinations for increasing UCS values are 10% 40-nm Al2O3 for Eagle Ford Shale, and 3% 40-nm MgO for Mancos Shale. Compared to results with 3% KCl, the increase in UCS given by the above combinations of nanoparticles are 31.9% for Eagle Ford Shale and 54.8% for Mancos Shale. The application of appropriate nanoparticles on shales can increase their strengths and reduce the risk of wellbore collapse. Introduction Pore Plugging of Shales For conventional formations, mud cake will be formed during overbalanced drilling. As discussed by Salehi et al., 2015, drilling fluid will penetrate into the formation, whose pores will be plugged by solid particles in the drilling fluids, and create a mud cake to prevent further penetration. However, a mud cake is difficult to form in shale formations because the size of conventional drilling fluid particles is larger than the pore size of shale (Li et al., 2012). This difficulty can cause wellbore stability problems, which sparks in-depth research into the sealing of pores and micro-fractures of shales. Nanoparticles can be an alternative to seal pores and micro-fractures, considering their sizes are comparable to those of pores in shale formation. However, even though some engineers, including Zhou et al., 2013, Sensoy et al., 2009, Sharma et al., 2012, Jung et al., 2013, Cai et al., 2012, started to apply nanotechnology to drilling mud to address shale instability problems, only limited types of nanoparticles and shales have been tested. Therefore, this area requires in-depth studies to improve our understanding of the effects of different nanoparticles upon the sealing of pores and micro-fractures. "

In fact, the need is more pronounced in industries that are very important for human survival such as food processing, pharmaceuticals and energy (coal, oil and gas). A lot of work has been done in the past 30 years in understanding the factors affecting the deposition velocity of solids in slurries. Experimental observation and theoretical predictions pointed to mixture velocity and solid/fluid properties especially rheology of the resulting slurry to be the most important factors that dramatically affect particle motion and patterning. This paper presents a critical deposition velocity model and a \"stability flow map\" for complex rheology slurries. The critical deposition model utilizes a more robust generalized 2-parameter rheology model to account for any given slurry rheology. The \"stability flow map\" demarcates the different flow patterns that may be observed at different mixture velocity and rheology. On this map, the homogeneous slurries are predicted at low rheology and high mixture velocity whereas heterogeneous slurries (with a concentration gradient) predicted at high rheology (yield stress effects). Sensitivity analysis was conducted on critical Reynolds number, particle density, carrier fluid density, generalized flow behavior index, and pipe diameter. It was observed that increase in shear thinning behavior, particle density, pipe diameter, and particle diameter led to a decrease in the laminar region and an increased unstable region. The model showed good performance when tested on glass and stainless steel beads test data available in open literature. The model was tested on hydrate slurries generated with additives at The University of Tulsa and the flow regime predictions were in good agreement with observations. Preliminary simulation with this map may help engineers select flowline size and carrier fluid rheology for a given type of solid particle. "

A numerical model is presented that accurately estimates the annular frictional pressure losses with and without the inner pipe rotation. The numerical model is validated using a CFD software. Experiments are conducted at a 27 m long flow loop using various fluids that can be characterized as Yield Power Law (YPL). The results of the experiments are compared with the results obtained with the numerical model. Today, the most drilling fluids show YPL behavior. The proposed numerical model can calculate the equivalent circulating density while circulating YPL fluids accurately. The model is validated with a CFD software and compared with experimental results, the published experimental results and with the slot approximation. The results obtained from the numerical model shows good agreement with the experiments and also with the experimental results from the literature. The comparisons between the models indicate that the slot approximation can result in large errors especially when the diameter ratio is low, meaning the diameter of the inner pipe is significantly smaller compared to outer pipe. The numerical model is coupled with a stability criterion that determines the onset and offset of the transitional flow between laminar and turbulent regions of YPL fluids. Various degrees of eccentricity are analyzed in terms of pressure profile and flow stability with the proposed method. This study contributes to a better understanding of flow in annuli. The results obtained from this study are useful to predict the transition and the annular frictional pressure loss profiles more accurately than existing methods.

                    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) plays a vital role in hydraulic preplanning and real-time management of drilling operations. Such accuracy is often not available in case of drilling horizontal and extended reach wells, when there is a partially or fully eccentric annulus in a large section of the wellbore. Many hydraulic models, including those widely used in the industry based on e.g. the Narrow Slot approximation, simply ignore the effects of drillpipe eccentricity on annular pressure loss and equivalent circulating density (ECD), thereby generating unreliable estimates for these important quantities. In this study, we discuss the experimental, analytical, and numerical results of a comprehensive investigation into the impact of drillpipe eccentricity on ECD in horizontal and extended reach wells while circulating non-Newtonian drilling fluids. A 91 ft. long flow loop with a drillpipe to hole/casing ratio of 0.5 (fairly common in conventional drilling applications) was used for the experimental investigation. Drillpipe was placed at the bottom of the hole/casing, thereby simulating a fully eccentric annulus. Four non-Newtonian drilling fluids, which their rheological behavior best described by the Yield Power Law (YPL) model, were used as test fluids. Moreover, a novel numerical model based on a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach was developed. Subsequently, the experimental data was compared with both the new proposed model as well as with several other widely used analytical and numerical models previously reported in the literature. Field data analysis was also conducted to investigate the impact of eccentricity on ECD in a deviated well. The experimental results confirm and add to the historical observations that the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus is significantly less than the values predicted by the Narrow Slot approach, sometimes by more than 50%. In general, all the evaluated models underestimated the effect of drillpipe eccentricity on annular frictional pressure loss. However, by comparison, the newly proposed model in this study exhibited by far the least discrepancy with the experimental results. The difference between the estimated and experimental results was found to be proportional to the magnitude of the fluid yield stress and consistency index, and attributed to the complexity associated with simulating YPL fluids. This study provides valuable insight towards superior hydraulic planning and real-time ECD management in horizontal and extended-reach wells. Its beneficial impact on managing the annular pressure between the fracture and pore pressure in the field to prevent drilling problems such as kicks, mud loss and wellbore instability events is expected to be immediate. Its use will also be key to successful implementation of innovative drilling techniques such as managed pressure drilling and dual gradient drilling, which require highly accurate annular pressure prediction and management.

                    "abstract": "Interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and clay minerals have been identified as an important factor in wellbore instability of shale formations. Current wellbore stability models consider the interactions between aqueous drilling fluids and pore fluid but their interactions with shale matrix is neglected. This study provides a realistic method to incorporate the interaction mechanism into wellbore stability analysis through laboratory experiment and mathematical modeling. The adsorption isotherms of two shale rocks, Catoosa shale and Mancos shale are obtained. The adsorption isotherms of the selected shales are compared with those of other shale types in the literature. It is shown that the adsorption isotherms of various shale rocks can be scaled using their respective cation exchange capacity, into a single adsorption curve. The experimental results show that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory. The adsorption parameters can be suggested as an index to characterize different shale formations. This study shows that the adsorption theory can be used to generalize wellbore stability problem in order to consider the case of non-ideal drilling fluids. Furthermore, the adsorption model can be combined with empirical correlations to update the compressive strength of shale under downhole conditions. Accordingly, a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability simulator is developed to explore the stability of transversely isotropic shale formations. The coupled transport equations are solved using an implicit finite difference method. The results of this study indicate that the range of safe mud weight reduces due to the moisture adsorption phenomenon. 1. INTRODUCTION Shale rocks are often regarded as weak rocks in terms of compressive and tensile strength. It is known that presence of bedding planes and lamination imparts anisotropy to mechanical properties of rocks. The effect of bedding plane on rock failure has long been recognized [1-3]. Drilling through shale formations is often associated with borehole instability problems. York et al. (2009) reported that the wellbore instability issues in a well with 20,000 ft MD could at least cost 2.5 million dollars [4]. Hamayun (2011) discussed the results of a survey that indicates about one third of Non-Productive Time (NPT) of drilling operations is spent on wellbore problems, of which a major portion is attributed to the wellbore instability issues [5]. Hydration of clay minerals is recognized to be one of the important interaction processes between shale and drilling fluid during drilling process, which often leads to various operational problems such as shale swelling, stuck pipe, reduction of rate of penetration [6, 7]. Usually two kinds of clay swelling is realized, namely, the interacrystalline swelling due to the hydration of exchangeable cations and osmotic swelling which occurs due to a large difference between ion concentration (or water activity) of shale and aqueous fluids [8-10].

This study explains how to design and apply a steady-state Kalman filter to predict real-time formation pore pressure optimally by combining outputs from both Eaton's model and from Logging While Drilling (LWD). The objectives of this study are to minimize the noise on pore pressure predicted from well logs (or LWD) measurements and to compute the next estimate of pore pressure ahead of bit using only the most recent measurement. Data obtained from well logs usually have noise measurements. The noise measurements lead to changes of the results acquired from well logs. Therefore, uncertainties occur on the estimated pore pressure. The designed Kalman filter is a recursive data processing algorithm to produce optimal estimate of pore pressure ahead of the drill bit. The estimates tend to be more refined than those based on measurements from well logs alone. First, Eaton's method, which is one of the most widely used pore pressure prediction methods, was modeled and represented in the state-space form required for Kalman Filter modeling. Parameters used in the Kalman Filter algorithm were also identified in state-space form. A computer code to implement the designed Kalman filter algorithm has been developed. Additionally, field data were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Based on the results, it is concluded that Kalman filter can be a very effective tool for detecting overpressure zones to avoid drilling problems before entering such zones. The most important achievement is that the developed algorithm can be used as a design tool in offshore and onshore drilling operations along with real-time LWD data to optimally estimate the formation pore pressure of the next interval ahead of the bit during the drilling operation.

                    "abstract": "It is common practice when drilling oil and gas wells to assume that the drillstring is placed concentrically in the annular space with either the open hole or previous casing strings in order to predict annular frictional pressure losses. The assumption of such a concentric annulus is, however, a considerable simplification that may not properly reflect the majority of drilling applications in the field. In fact, with an increasing number of deviated/horizontal and extended reach wells being drilled, a fully eccentric annulus is actually present in a large section of the wellbore. In this study, we apply experimental, analytical, and numerical approaches to investigate the impact of drillpipe eccentricity on the annular pressure loss while circulating non-Newtonian drilling fluids. The length of the experimental section of a flow loop was 27.74 m (91′) and it consisted of 0.0245 m (1″) steel drillpipe and 0.0571 m (2.25″) acrylic casing with the inner diameter of 0.0508 m (2″). Drillpipe was placed at the bottom of the casing, thereby simulating a fully eccentric annulus. Four Yield Power Law (YPL) drilling fluids were tested in this flow loop. Annular pressure loss for a wide range of laminar flow rates was recorded for each fluid. A numerical model based on a finite difference approach was developed to estimate the annular pressure loss. Subsequently, the experimental data was compared with the proposed model and also with several other widely used analytical and numerical approaches previously reported in the literature. The obtained results show that in the laminar flow regime, the annular frictional pressure loss in a fully eccentric annulus is considerably less than a concentric annulus, on occasions by less than 50%. In general, all the applied models under-estimated the effect of eccentricity on pressure loss. However, the novel proposed model showed the least discrepancy with the experimental data. Furthermore, it was found that the difference between the estimated and experimental results increases with increasing fluid yield stress. This suggests that models and/or correlations that are developed to correct for the eccentricity effect for fluids with negligible yield stress (for instance Power Law fluids) are not suitable to estimate the pressure loss for YPL fluids with elevated yield stress.

                    "abstract": "An experimental study followed by comprehensive flow modeling is presented. The experiments were conducted on a horizontal annulus with drillstring under compression, considering the influence of rotation on frictional pressure losses of yield-power-law (YPL) fluids. Flow through various buckling configurations with and without drillstring rotation was investigated. Correlations of critical Reynolds numbers are presented that predict the onset and offset of transition from laminar- to turbulent-flow regions in concentric and eccentric annuli. A broad model of flow of YPL fluids is proposed for concentric, eccentric, and buckled configurations. The model includes the effects of rotation in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. A 91-ft inner pipe was rotated while applying axial compression during flow. At the no-compression case, eccentricity of the inner pipe is varied as the drillstring rotated. The aim for such a design was to simulate actual drilling operations. The test matrix involves flow through sinusoidal, transitional, and helically buckled drillstring. The effect of pitch length is investigated. Helical modes with two different pitch lengths were tested. Eight distinct YPL fluids were used to examine the dependence of pressure losses on fluid parameters. In the theoretical part, a stability criterion is modified to determine the onset of transitional flow of YPL fluids and a correlation is proposed for practical purposes. In addition, pressure-loss-prediction models are presented for the flow of YPL fluids through concentric, eccentric, free, and buckled configurations of the drillstring, with and without rotation. The proposed models are compared with data from the literature and the experiments. It has been observed that increasing eccentricity and rotary speed causes an earlier transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Results suggest reduced pressure losses with an eccentric pipe. In addition, buckled configurations showed a further decrease of frictional pressure losses as the compression increases. In the helical mode, two pitch lengths are compared, and decreasing the pitch length resulted in a decrease in pressure losses. Rotation tests are conducted with free and buckled configurations. Rotation in the free-drillstring mode showed an increase in pressure losses as the rotary speed of the drillstring increases. Amplified vigorous motion of the drillstring is visually observed as the drillstring is buckled while rotating. Rotating the drillstring while buckled showed a further increase in pressure losses compared to rotating in free mode. This additional increase in pressure losses is attributed to the more-dynamic motion of the drillstring. Distinct differences of pressure losses in the effects of buckling and rotation are observed in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. Significant differences are measured in the transition region. "

The main objective of OSS survey is to provide: • Detailed design and during construction: a quantitative basis for assessment of global - eulerian buckling (upheaval and lateral buckling as results of axial loads due to restrained thermal expansion) in presence of out-of-straightness. This is the case of buried pipelines for which the straightness of the bottom of the trench is a factor. • During operation: verification of the presence of expected or unexpected buckles where bending may exceed the operational limits established for the material and pipe wall thickness, by the mechanical design. This is mainly the case of exposed pipelines for which unexpected lateral deflection can be the result of incidental third party interaction. Global buckling is a significant design topic for HP/HT flowlines or export pipelines in the early stretch, where thermal expansion might be recovered by developing excessive bending. Therefore, the development of specific techniques to perform OOS survey as well as the analysis of the acquired data is getting increasingly crucial, since the outcome of this activity drives the decisions on mitigations needed for pipeline safe operation as per design. After a brief description of the OOS survey technology and engineering interpretative tools, a few operational applications are presented.

                    "abstract": "Frictional pressure loss calculations and estimating the performance of cuttings transport during underbalanced drilling operations are more difficult due to the characteristics of multi-phase fluid flow inside the wellbore. In directional or horizontal wellbores, such calculations are becoming more complicated due to the inclined wellbore sections, since gravitational force components are required to be considered properly. Even though there are numerous studies performed on pressure drop estimation for multiphase flow in inclined pipes, not as many studies have been conducted for multiphase flow in annular geometries with eccentricity. In this study, the frictional pressure losses are examined thoroughly for liquid–gas multiphase flow in horizontal eccentric annulus. Pressure drop measurements for different liquid and gas flow rates are recorded. Using the experimental data, a mechanistic model based on the modification of Lockhart and Martinelli [18] is developed. Additionally, 4 different computational intelligence techniques (nearest neighbor, regression trees, multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machines – SVM) are modeled and developed for pressure drop estimation. The results indicate that both mechanistic model and computational intelligence techniques estimated the frictional pressure losses successfully for the given flow conditions, when compared with the experimental results. It is also noted that the computational intelligence techniques performed slightly better than the mechanistic model. "

A practical numerical model is proposed that accurately estimates the annular frictional pressure losses with and without the inner pipe rotation. Experiments are conducted at a 91 ft. long flow loop using various fluids that can be characterized as Yield Power Law (YPL). A commercial CFD software is used to validate the proposed numerical approach. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed model, CFD results, experimental results, the published experimental results and most widely used models from the literature is presented. The experimental setup simulates horizontal wellbore applications, which are increasingly prevalent due to recent shale plays. Today, since most drilling fluids show YPL behavior, YPL fluids with a wide range of rheological properties are used as test fluids in this study. The numerical model is coupled with a stability criterion that determines the onset and offset of the transitional flow between laminar and turbulent regions. The velocity profiles of a wide range of diameter ratios, Taylor and Reynolds numbers are presented. Various degrees of eccentricity are analyzed in terms of pressure profile and flow stability with the proposed method. The results from the experiments show significantly reduced pressure drops in fully eccentric annuli compared to concentric geometry. An increase in pressure loss is observed as the pipe is rotated while it is eccentric. The comparisons between the models indicate that the slot approximation can result in large errors especially when the diameter ratio is low. A 3D wellbore can be evaluated with grids using the proposed numerical method and the local stability criterion, which leads to accurate pressure loss estimations. Grid analysis can show the flow state profile and the pressure loss profile of a wellbore, which has potential to optimize operations in real-time or in the design phase. This study contributes to a better understanding of flow in annuli. The results obtained from this study are useful to predict the transition and the annular frictional pressure loss profiles more accurately than existing methods.

Both theoretical and experimental approaches are followed to better understand the onset of transitional flow. The objective of this study is to investigate the stability of the flow in concentric and eccentric annuli. Theoretical analysis of the inner and outer shear regions, to clarify the earlier transition observed with experimental studies, are within the scope of this study. A stability criterion based on the ratio of turbulent energy production and rate of work done by viscous stresses is used to determine the end of laminar flow. Experiments are conducted for laminar, transition and turbulent regions of flow in a fully eccentric annulus. Eight distinct YPL fluids are tested and the results are compared with a proposed model and models available in the literature. The proposed stability parameter shows an earlier transition near the outer wall for a wide range of non-Newtonian fluids, which is in agreement with measurements in the literature. The proposed modification is extended to eccentric annuli and showed good agreement with experiments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to locally predict the onset of transition in eccentric annuli of YPL fluids. Transition from laminar to turbulent significantly depends on eccentricity, diameter ratio and fluid properties, especially to the shear thinning ability of a fluid. The proposed modification allows a fair prediction of the transition from laminar to turbulent regions in eccentric annuli. With the proposed approach, the percentage of laminar and non-laminar regions for a cross section of an eccentric annulus can be predicted. "

                    "abstract": "In spite of many recent technology improvements in drilling, hole cleaning remains a significant challenge, especially in deviated and horizontal wells. Inadequate hole cleaning can lead to a series of problems such as stuck pipe, fractured formation, high drag and torque, premature bit wear, decreased ROP, logging, and casing and cementing difficulties. Hole cleaning is a complex issue that is affected by many drilling parameters. The major approaches of hole cleaning evaluations include experimental correlations and mechanistic models. But these techniques frequently require complex computations or numerical iterations to get the solutions. In this paper, a set of charts is developed to allow the drilling engineer to quickly estimate the cuttings volumetric concentration in the wellbore. From previous cuttings transport studies, we know that well inclination angle, drilling fluid velocity, fluid rheology, fluid density and drill pipe rotation have the most important effects on hole cleaning. These parameters are divided into several ranges based on their sensitivity to cuttings concentration in the wellbore. The charts are obtained by running a hole cleaning simulator, which is based on a large number of experimental and modeling studies of cuttings transport. The results of the charts are verified by experimental data. The difference between the charts' prediction results and experimental data are within 20%. Instead of solving complex equations in cuttings transport models, drilling engineers are able to quickly estimate the cuttings volumetric concentration by looking up the charts and conducting very simple calculations. This paper is also helpful in guiding the driller to quickly choose proper operational parameters during drilling operations. "

Although both full- and partial-flotation methodologies have been used successfully to extend the reach in many field cases, the influence of buoyancy on tubular instability has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an extensive experimental and analytical study, focusing on static tubular instability inside horizontal wellbores with emphasis on buoyancy. In terms of the experimental research, running tubulars into horizontal wellbores was simulated with four different pipes, varying buoyancy, and varying loading speed. Throughout the tests, axial loads both applied to the pipe and transmitted through the pipe were recorded simultaneously, with respect to pipe displacement. Experiments reveal that currently existing models give reasonable approximations as long as buoyancy is not included in the tests. The major interpretation from the experiments is contrary to what currently existing expressions imply (i.e., tubular buckles immediately as effective weight approaches zero; even for naturally buoyant conditions, considerable amount of axial load is still required for both buckling initiation and helix formation). As buoyancy increases further, results and predictions diverge from each other considerably. To eliminate the discrepancies between results and predictions,theoretical study was conducted. Empirical correlations that also consider the influence of buoyancy on critical buckling loads are presented. Finally, another pipe was also tested within different buoyancy conditions to validate the equations developed. Experimental results of this pipe closely match the new analytical findings. This experimental and analytical study provides useful results for future applications with buoyancy-assisted tubulars, in terms of practical engineering and design calculations. "

                    "abstract": "The phenomenon of settlement of weighting-material particles in drilling fluid is known as barite sag, which can lead to a number of drilling problems including lost circulation, well-control difficulties, poor cementing operation, and stuck pipe. This study investigates barite sag, both experimentally and numerically, in the annulus under flow conditions. Settlement of the weighting materials is generally called barite sag because barite is the most popular weight material used in drilling industry. The experimental part of the study has been conducted using a flow loop with 35-ft-long annulus test section to investigate the effects of fluid velocity in annulus, annulus eccentricity, pipe rotation, and inclination angle on barite sag. Density of the flowing fluid is measured continuously using Coriolis densitometers at the inlet and outlet of the annular test section. The simulation part of this study is based on a proposed particle- tracking method called “particle-elimination technique.” In this method, falling and axial velocities of the solid particles are estimated to predict their travelling paths. Density of the flowing fluid is updated, taking into account the number of particles that become stationary by reaching the casing wall. To model the downward motion of the barite bed on an inclined bed, the analogy of falling film of a viscous liquid on an inclined plane is applied. Velocity of the falling barite bed is calculated on the basis of an apparent viscosity approximated by the experiments. Knowing the velocity of the moving bed, the mass rate of barite downstream of the bed, which goes back into the main flow stream, is calculated and a new density for the moving fluid is achieved. The numerical simulation is modified from laboratory scale to real wellbore dimensions to be used for practical drilling applications. Results of the tests indicate that the highest sag occurs at low annular velocities, low rotational speeds, and high inclination angles. Barite-sag reduction caused by decreasing the inclination angle continues until the inclination-angle values are approximately 60 degrees, after which it becomes insignificant. Another observation made from experimental results and simulation work is that as the circulation of the drilling fluid in the loop continues, the fluid density decreases until it reaches an equilibrium stage. The equilibrium stage occurs faster for lower inclination angles. Effects of annular velocity and inner-pipe rotational speed on barite sag are similar; however, they are different from the trend observed when the inclination angle changes. Eccentricity of a nonrotating inner pipe did not have a significant effect on barite sag. However, the effect of inner-pipe rotation on barite sag for an eccentric annulus is more significant than in the concentric case. Comparing the results of numerical simulation with the experimental study shows a good agreement. The proposed simulation approach in this study can be used for barite-sag predictions in the annulus. A good prediction of the barite sag can prevent hazardous situations and would help engineers in drilling wells to spend less money and time. "

                    "abstract": "Failure to minimize lost circulation can greatly increase the cost of drilling and the risk of well abandonment. The main reason why some of the remedial procedures are not working as planned is the lack of information in loss zone locations. Inaccurate estimation of loss zone location prevents the treatment to be applied directly at the point of loss, results in low efficiency and extended nonproductive rig time. This paper describes an approach for identifying the location of loss zones in directional wells using distributed temperature measurement while drilling. A transient thermal model for predicting the temperature profile in a directional well with mud loss is presented. The numerical solution under different lost circulation conditions, when used together with the distributed temperature measurement, can identify the location of mud loss. For a deep high pressure high temperature well with severe lost circulation, there is a significant change in the thermal behavior of the wellbore as mud loss continues. The characteristics of wellbore thermal behavior are evaluated and identified as good indicators of loss zone location. The distributed temperature measurement while drilling is enabled by a drilling microchip technology that has been developed and validated with successful field tests. By matching simulated results with the distributed temperature measurements at different timestamp, the depth of the loss zone can be accurately identified. Case Studies are given to show the practical applications of the method. The results are important in applying expandable tubular system, setting cement plug and spotting lost circulation pills. An additional application of this approach is the identification of highly permeable zones for reservoir or formation evaluation. Introduction Lost circulation is as old as rotary drilling, and it remains as one of the most persistent and costly drilling problems. It happens when a very porous, cavernous or highly fractured zones intercept the current well path, and drilling mud is lost into that zone under the overbalance pressure between the wellbore and formation. Lost circulation not only costs large volumes of valuable drilling fluids, it also causes large amounts of nonproductive time as when circulation takes place the drilling crew cannot continue to perform most of their normal functions. In addition, lost circulation may cause additional drilling problems such as stuck pipe because of poor cuttings removal and extensive formation damage from lost circulation remedial treatments. In extreme cases, the loss of hydrostatic pressure can cause an influx of gas or fluid, which could potentially result in a blowout of the well. Severe lost-circulation problems that do not respond well to conventional treatments might be curable by spotting an LCM pill and holding it under gentle squeeze pressure for a predetermined period. At downhole temperatures, the LCM pill expands rapidly to fill and bridge fractures, allowing drilling and cementing operations to resume quickly. During this process it is important to know the location of the lost circulation zone, so the pills can be spotted to the right location. In addition, the overbalance pressure varies with depth, therefore the squeeze pressure can be optimized by knowing the depth of the fracture. When severe loss occurs, placing a cement plug is one effective way of sealing the loss zone completely, followed by drilling back through the plug or sidetracking the well, as shown in Fig. 1. However, without the knowledge of the loss zone location, it is difficult to decide at what depth to set the cement plug or whether it is a good decision to set a cement plug instead of other remedial methods.

                    "abstract": "One of the major concerns when drilling deepwater wells is fluid loss since the fracture gradients are typically lower than their onshore counterparts. Failure to minimize the fluid loss can significantly increase the cost of drilling, and even lead to abandonment of the well. Successful management of lost circulation should incorporate accurate estimation of loss zone location, followed by corresponding lost circulation control procedures. This paper presents an innovative way to estimate the location of mud loss by interpreting distributed temperature measurement which is facilitated by a recently developed drilling microchip technology. Firstly, a transient wellbore thermal model is presented to predict the effect of mud loss on the change in circulating mud temperature profile for tubular fluids. The model is developed based on heat balance equations with variable local flow rates along the wellbore due to the mud loss. The effects of heat transfer above the seabed between riser and the drilling muds are included. Downward shifts in the temperature curves are noted in both the drillpipe and annulus. With distributed temperature measurement data, the derivative of annulus temperature with respect to depth can be used to effectively identify the location of the loss zone. A case study has been conducted to identify the location of a loss zone in a deepwater well. According to the results, a jump in the derivative coincides with the location of loss and is sufficiently significant in magnitude to be identified. The seawater-riser heat transfer has minimum effect on the loss zone prediction; furthermore, the effect of the same amount of loss is more conspicuous if the loss occurs at a shallower depth, in which case the loss zone can be more reliably located.

                    "abstract": "Annular pressure build up (APB) is an important problem in the area of well design. Different solutions have been proposed to mitigate APB, including vacuum-insulated tubing, silicate foam wellbore insulation techniques, and insulating with completion (packer) fluids. However, proposed solutions that include the optimization of annular fluid rheology of drilling fluids trapped in the outer annuli need further investigation. Convective and conductive heat transfer through fluids placed between the casing strings is a driving force for increasing annular pressure. This study explains how to design and optimize the rheological and thermal properties of drilling fluid to provide a sustainable and reliable insulating performance. The objectives of this study are 1) to develop a better insight of APB in the annulus of casing and 2) to experimentally measure and 3) analytically model the effect of different parameters, such as rheological and thermal properties, on the insulating performance of drilling fluid trapped in annular spaces. By combining the theory of sedimentation and the model proposed for free convective heat transfer of Yield Power Law fluids, a stepwise guideline is proposed to estimate the Nusselt number and thermal conductivity coefficient of annular fluids. A computer code to perform this procedure has been developed. Additionally, a unique experimental apparatus was designed and constructed to investigate the insulating performance of drilling fluids. Experimental observation and model results indicate that compressive yield stress, density difference between the solid and liquid phases of a drilling fluid, solid particle size and annular space geometry, are four important factors that determine sedimentation rate. These criteria can be used to characterize YPL annular fluid properties to minimize sedimentation rate and consequently to reduce free convective flow. The magnitude of the convective heat transfer coefficient is affected by the shear yield stress and density of annular fluid, by the flow behavior index (m), consistency index (k), conductivity coefficient and specific heat of the YPL fluid, and by annular space clearance. This conclusion can be used to quantitatively analyze the reliability and sustainability of the insulating performance of drilling fluids. The sedimentation profile, shear yield stress distribution and effective conductivity coefficient profile as functions of time and depth, as well as the Nusselt number, Nu, as a function of temperature difference in the radial direction can be estimated by the introduced guideline. The most important achievement is that the developed guideline can be used as a design tool in offshore drilling and completion operations to mitigate APB. A practical benefit of this study is demonstrated by the application of its findings in an illustrative example. "

                    "abstract": "Experiments to investigate the effect of the pore pressure on a single PDC cutter forces were performed on Sandstone core samples. The experiments were performed in a high pressure single PDC cutter testing facility which is designed to perform one round of cut on the test rock sample with a single PDC cutter. The cell confining pressure and the pore pressure were controlled and other operating conditions such as the depth of the cut and rotary speed were kept relatively constant. The results can be applied to equip PDC bit simulators with better bit performance prediction by considering the effect of the formation pore pressure in the model. Such knowledge improves the drilling optimization analysis by providing more accurate predictive guidelines. The methods used and the lessons learned in these experimental investigations can be modified and utilized in more advanced similar types of investigations. The results show that the lack of the pore pressure can increase the MSE by at least 15%. These experimental data were used in production of well-fitting correlations of logarithmic nature relating the MSE to the differential pressure and the confining pressure. The same type of behavior, but to a lower extent, was observed when the drilling strength was considered; for instance, the extent to which the drilling strength increases due to the lack of the pore pressure is about 10% for these tests. According to a former analytical study, these tests were performed in a high speed regime in which the MSE is independent of the pore pressure. The test results do not support this conclusion; possible reasons including an overestimation of the rock shear dilatancy in that study are investigated. This study adds up to the rock mechanics knowledge of the PDC bit cutting action by proposing a quantitative means to account for the effect of the pore pressure. The results can not only be used to enhance the accuracy of any type of PDC bit simulator; but also, to test or validate rock failure models that consider the pore pressure. "

                    "abstract": "One of the major concerns in drilling operations is gas kick detection and blow out control. If not detected early or properly controlled, gas kicks could be disastrous. Loss of human lives, polluting the environment (especially in deep offshore drilling) and financial losses are possible consequences of a blow out. Despite significant enhancements in offshore drilling technology, still conventional well control indicators are applied for gas kick detection in most of the offshore wells. These indicators are rudimentary and are not sufficiently reliable for drilling costly offshore wells. Now, having access to continuous pressure data along the wellbore at very high rate and independent of drilling fluid type is offered by mounting pressure sensors on intelligent (wired) drillpipe. One the most important applications of this new technology is early gas kick detection and enhancements in safely. However, in order to apply this technology for early gas detection, variations in annular pressure profile during entering gas influx to the wellbore should be precisely predicted. To accomplish this goal, different involved regions are modeled and a numerical scheme and a transient gas kick simulator are developed to solve the equations. Simulator is validated with available two-phase experimental data (air-water and air-mud) from a large-scale flow loop (8 in X 4.5 in, 90 ft long) at The University of Tulsa. Based on the analysis of simulated annular pressure profile, methodologies are developed for early kick detection and determining its location for different drilling scenarios. For instance, obtained results indicate that during entrance of gas influx in Constant Bottomhole Pressure Technique of Managed Pressure Drilling, pressure at all sensors increases simultaneously. This criterion can be used for early detection of gas influx; furthermore, determination of influx location is conducted by monitoring variations in pressure derivative curve at each sensor. For this scenario, when gas influx reaches a certain sensor, pressure derivative value starts to decline. This study shows that mounting pressure sensors on intelligent drillpipe can enhance safety significantly by shortening gas detection time to half and monitoring its movement in the wellbore. "

While adjusting the flow rates for each phase, common application is to adjust liquid phase for proper cuttings transport, and to adjust gas phase for controlling bottomhole pressure. Unfortunately, each of these phases flow with relatively different local velocities, causing various flow patterns to occur, which leads to fluctuations in hole cleaning performance as well as frictional pressure losses. These flow patterns are influenced by hole inclination, geometry, and presence of cuttings. This study addresses the hydrodynamic behavior of two-phase drilling fluids in inclined section of wellbores with the presence of cuttings as a third phase with inner pipe rotation, considering eccentricity. Extensive experiments were conducted at a cuttings transport flow loop using air-water mixtures under a wide range of flow rates, rate of penetrations (ROPs), pipe rotations and hole inclinations. During the experiments, frictional pressure losses, in-situ flow rates for each phase, ROP, inclination and pipe rotation speed were recorded. The experimental data was also used to investigate the cuttings transport mechanisms. A comprehensive mechanistic model was developed for determining the frictional pressure losses and hole cleaning performance of two-phase drilling fluids based on the experimental observations. It has been concluded that the proposed model is estimating the frictional pressure losses reasonably accurate when compared with the measured values. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques rely on precisely controlling annular pressure profile and hence enabling us to overcome challenges due to narrow mud window in offshore and deep-water drilling. In a Constant Bottom-Hole Pressure (CBHP) MPD the bottom-hole pressure is kept relatively constant which allows circulating small influxes out of the well without shutting in. However, during circulation, annular pressure must not exceed the fracture pressure of the weak zones and maximum allowable surface pressure. Therefore, accurate prediction of the annular pressure profile is vital in the decision making process. It enables us to decide whether to continue drilling, shut in the well or take another action such as increasing the pump rate or mud weight. Most of the annular pressure prediction methods during entrance of an influx rely on simplifying assumptions that can cause a significant error and a faulty well design. This issue becomes more important during drilling with Synthetic Based Mud (SBM) in which solubility of gas in the mud cannot be ignored. We attempt to present a transient model for an accurate prediction of annular pressure profile during well control operations in CBHP technique of MPD. The presented model is developed based on the conservation equations and it takes the solubility of gas in synthetic based mud into account. The validity of the model has been tested against the available experimental data from the field scale low-pressure flow loop (8?? X 4.5??, 90' long) available at The University of Tulsa. Annular pressure profile and maximum surface pressure (casing peak pressure) during circulation of a gas influx are calculated by the introduced transient two-phase model. A chart based methodology and a simple algorithm are developed by which, the proper action could be taken according to the simulation results. This provides a powerful decision making and design tool in MPD operations that ensures delivery of safer wells with lower Non Productive Time (NPT). Introduction Increasing demands for oil and gas and depleting conventional reservoirs during the past century have lead the petroleum industry to drill in harsh and hostile environments such as deep offshore that requires advanced technology. One of the most important issues in drilling such wells is the narrow mud window between fracture and formation pressures. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) techniques rely on precisely controlling annular pressure profile in the wellbore. The intention of MPD is to avoid continuous influx of formation fluids to the surface. A permanent concern in any drilling operations is kick control and blow out prevention. A kick is defined as any influx that constitutes a well control emergency. In conventional drilling, this means using the blowout preventer (BOP) to shut in the well. It results in building up the casing pressure and increasing the bottom-hole pressure, which ceases entering additional influx to wellbore. Subsequently, kick will be removed by using Drillers Method or Wait and Weight Method. The key for a successful kick removal operation is to keep the bottom-hole pressure constant and prevent further entry of gas influx during circulation. The most important indicators for detecting an influx are pit gain and variations in pump pressure. In managed pressure drilling the well control emergency may not apply, as the system is already set up for this occurrence. "

                    "abstract": "One of the major challenges of oil industry is to predict the in-situ stress field accurately. Accordingly, different techniques have been developed to predict the reservoir stress field in the past decades. Inversion Technique is a powerful method which was developed to determine the minimum and maximum horizontal stress components and their direction using fracturing data, i.e., leak-off tests or mini-fracture tests, by solving an over-constrained system of equations. As compared to other indirect methods, the actual fracturing data is used in this technique to back calculate the stress field. In this paper, a new feature is added that enable us to determine the stress field using the data gathered during the production history of reservoir. In this approach, the effect of pore pressure changes on the reservoir stresses is incorporated into the Inversion Technique using constitutive equations of orthotropic rock model. Using the proposed technique, minimum and maximum horizontal stress components can be determined corresponding to different pore pressure during the reservoir life. According to the field data, the new formulation increases the prediction accuracy when fracturing data is gathered corresponding to different pore pressure. The proposed approach can be used for more accurate well design applications during the life of reservoir. Introduction It is critical for the oil industry to know the stress field within a reservoir for well-designing issues. In most cases, the stress field is non-hydrostatic, which means all principle stresses have different values. Usually, two minimum and maximum horizontal stress components are assumed in the reservoirs where the overburden stress can be obtained from density logs. Hubbert and Willis (1957) investigated the hydraulic fracturing mechanism and its relation to the in-situ stress field. According to their results, the direction of hydraulically-induced fracture is perpendicular to the least principle stress. Consequently, there is a relationship between in-situ stress field and induced hydraulic fractures. The direct measurement of minimum horizontal stress can be done using fracturing tests, such as leak-off tests or mini-fracture tests. However, if non-equal horizontal stresses exist, there is no method available for direct measurement of maximum horizontal stress. Indirect techniques based on core measurements have been attempted, such as differential strain curve analysis (Strickland and Ren 1980, Ren and Roegiers 1983) and differential wave velocity analysis, but have not gained widespread use. Several authors investigated the determination of stress field from the failure of inclined holes. Aadnoy (1990a, b) proposed an Inversion Technique to determine the horizontal principle stress components and their direction using available fracturing data from deviated wells. The leak-off test data, pore pressure, overburden stress and well configuration were used to determine the stress field. In principle, one needs only two sets of fracturing data in order to use this technique. However, the in-situ stress field can be determined using more fracturing data by solving an overdetermined system of equations. Induced fracture traces resulting from borehole fracturing operations were used in the analysis of the in-situ stress field, as well. Gjonnes et al. (1998) improved the Inversion Technique by taking into account the effect of shear stress components that were neglected before. Okabe et al. (1998) proposed a method to determine the in-situ stress field using the data collected from a single inclined borehole. The method can be used for a reverse-faulting regime and for drilling-induced fractures arranged en-echelon in inclined holes. The fracture directions must be read reliably using Formation Micro Imager (FMI) or Borehole Televiewer (BHTV). "

Forensuring a safe and successful underbalanced drilling operation, accurateprediction of the equivalent circulating density (ECD) is very important.Nevertheless, estimating ECD of gasified fluids is not easy due to thecomplexity of the two-phase fluid flow inside the wellbore. In this study,there are two major focuses considered; i) validation of the accuracy of Beggs& Brill (1973) model on the prediction of pressure losses of gasifiedfluids in underbalanced drilling operation, and modification of Beggs &Brill (1973) model for pressure loss estimation inside the wellbore, and ii) topropose an ECD calculation procedure for gasified fluids by using modifiedBeggs & Brill (1973) model. Tovalidate the accuracy of Beggs & Brill (1973) model, experiments werecarried out using Middle East Technical University (METU) Cuttings TransportFacility to obtain the pressure losses of gasified fluids in an annulus andtheir corresponding flow patterns. Air-water mixtures were used with variousin-situ air and water flow velocities of 0-120 ft/s and 0-10 ft/s,respectively, at wellbore inclinations of 90°, 75°, 60°, 45° and 12.5° withoutinner pipe rotation.

Resultsshowed that although Beggs & Brill (1973) model can estimate pressurelosses in low gas and liquid flow rates and low slip ratio between two phasesfor horizontal and near horizontal annular sections with a reasonable accuracy,this model cannot accurately calculate pressure losses at inclined and verticalannular sections. With some modifications, improved Beggs & Brill (1973)model (by applying suggested procedure) can be used to predict ECD and annularpressure losses of gasified fluids inside the annulus accurately. Thisinformation can be directly applied for underbalanced drilling operations whengasified fluids are used. "

Sensitivity analysis is conducted for various parameters such as influx sizes, mud flow rates and wellbore geometry. The results indicate that when gas influx enters the wellbore, pressure at all sensors increases simultaneously. This criterion can be used for early detection of gas kicks; In addition, when top of gas influx passes a certain sensor, pressure curve at that sensor declines. This fingerprint can be utilized in determining the location of the gas kick. This can be done even more precisely when pressure derivative curves are plotted to determine the time that a gas influx reaches a certain sensor. Using intelligent drill pipes in modern well control operations can reduce kick detection time to less than half, which results in significant reduction in non-productive time and enhancements in safety.

The second set was conducted by setting the pore pressure and confining pressure equal; i.e. the balanced pressure conditions with the pressures ranging from atmospheric pressure to 450 psi. The results of the first set of tests show that at 210 psi underbalance, the Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) is 58% of the MSE at the balanced conditions; while, extrapolating the trend the MSE at 210 psi overbalance is 117% of MSE at balanced pressure conditions. The second series shows an initial sharp increase of MSE as the pressure increases up to about 200 psi where is a maximum in MSE and then the values of MSE start to slowly decline as the pressure further increases.

These stress changes have a significant impact on the design of wells in these situations. Therefore, accurate prediction of reservoir stress path, i.e., change in horizontal stresses with pore pressure, is of vital importance. In this paper, a new formulation of stress path is developed that enable us to predict the effect of pore pressure on both minimum and maximum horizontal stresses in the presence of non-hydrostatic stress field for future well design consideration. According to the results, change of minimum horizontal stress with pore pressure is always larger than the change of maximum horizontal stress. Non-equal change of horizontal stresses increases the difference between them during production history. Using the new formulation, we are able to find the effect of pore pressure on formation fracture pressure in deviated wells, as well. Fracture initiation pressure change with pore pressure is larger parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal stress. Thus, we would have less wellbore instability problems if we drill toward the minimum horizontal stress direction after depletion. "

                    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the hole-cleaning process during the flow of a drilling fluid consisting of a gas and a liquid phase through a horizontal annulus. Experiments have been conducted using the Middle East Technical University (METU) multiphase flow loop under a wide range of air- and water-flow rates while introducing cuttings into the annulus for different amounts. Data have been collected for steady-state conditions (i.e., liquid, gas, and cuttings injection rates are stabilized). Collected data include flow rates of liquid and gas phases, frictional pressure drop inside the test section, local pressures at different locations in the flow loop, and high-speed digital images for identification of solid, liquid, and gas distribution inside the wellbore. Digital image-processing techniques are applied on the recorded images for volumetric phase distribution inside the test section, which are in dynamic condition. The effects of liquid and gas phases are investigated on cuttings-transport behavior under different flow conditions. Observations showed that the major contribution for carrying the cuttings along the wellbore is the liquid phase. However, as the gas-flow rate is increased, the flow area left for the liquid phase dramatically decreases, which leads to an increase in the local velocity of the liquid phase causing the cuttings to be dragged and moved, or a significant erosion on the cuttings bed. Therefore, increase in the flow rate of gas phase causes an improvement in the cuttings transport although the liquid-phase flow rate is kept constant. On the basis of the experimental observations, a mechanistic model that estimates the total cuttings concentration and frictional pressure loss inside the wellbore is introduced for gasified fluids flowing through a horizontal annulus. The model estimations are in good agreement with the measurements obtained from the experiments. By using the model, minimum liquid- and gas-flow rates can be identified for having an acceptable cuttings concentration inside the wellbore as well as a preferably low frictional pressure drop. Thus, the information obtained from this study is applicable to any underbalanced drilling operation conducted with gas/liquid mixtures, for optimization of flow rates for liquid and gas phases to transport the cuttings in the horizontal sections in an effective way with a reasonably low frictional pressure loss.

                    "abstract": "Use of buoyancy has emerged to provide multiple solutions to overcome the drag problem for wells with shallow and high step-out profiles. Although both full and partial floatation methodologies have been employed successfully to extend the reach in many field cases, the influence of buoyancy on tubular instability has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an extensive experimental and analytical study, focusing on static tubular instability inside horizontal wellbores with emphasis on buoyancy. In terms of the experimental research, running tubular into horizontal wellbores was simulated with four different pipes, varying buoyancy and loading speed. Throughout the tests, axial loads both applied to the pipe and transmitted through the pipe were recorded simultaneously, with respect to pipe displacement. Experiments reveal that currently existing models give reasonable approximations as long as buoyancy is not included into the tests. The major interpretation from experiments is such that contrary to what currently existing expressions imply, i.e. tubular buckles immediately as effective weight approaches zero; even for naturally buoyant conditions, considerable amount of axial load is still required for both buckling initiation and helix formation. As buoyancy increases further, results and predictions diverge from each other considerably. In order to eliminate the discrepancies between results and predictions, theoretical study was conducted. Empirical correlations that also consider the influence of buoyancy on critical buckling loads are presented. Finally, another pipe was also tested within different buoyancy conditions to validate the equations developed. Experimental results of this pipe closely match the new analytical findings. This experimental and analytical study provides useful results for future applications with buoyancy assisted tubulars, in terms of practical engineering and design calculations.  Introduction Over the last two decades, extended and mega reach wells, followed by multilaterals, have been common practices through the industry because they provide multiple solutions for restricted reservoir production, such as reaching larger areas from one surface location and keeping the well in the reservoir through longer departures. These distinct advantages of such wells have opened up new opportunities for many operators to improve hydrocarbon recoveries in such a way that drilling and future intervention costs make sense. Consequently, the ERD envelope has expanded rapidly and more challenging operational considerations have been faced with. Although it is a straight forward and well understood operational practice for conventional wells, running long casing strings in extended or mega reach wells has emerged as one of the most challenging operations due to the increasing level of drag between casing and the wellbore as step-out ratios have increased by the help of emerging technologies. One idea to overcome the issue of drag encountered when running long casing strings and sliding drilling is to reduce the effective weight of tubular, consequently the contact force by the use of buoyancy. However, the shortcoming with flotation methodologies is such that the buckling resistance of buoyed tubular also tends to be low. "

                    "title": "Improvement of Hole Cleaning Through Fiber Sweeps",
                    "abstract": "Abstract Hole cleaning is often more difficult during drilling of inclined wells. The resulting poor removal of cuttings can lead to problems such as borehole pack-off and excessive ECD, which are both difficult and expensive to resolve. Fluid sweeps are commonly implemented when normal circulation cannot adequately remove cuttings from the borehole. Field reports have indicated that specialized fibrous-type materials enhance cleaning performance when added to fluid sweeps. Yet, understanding of the behavior of this improvement remains inexact.  This paper presents a comparative experimental investigation of the hole cleaning performances of fiber sweeps, conducted with different drill pipe rotation speeds and fiber concentrations. Experiments were carried out in an inclined flow loop apparatus with an inner rotating drill pipe. The hole cleaning performance of fiber-containing sweep fluids using different fiber concentrations (0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2%, by weight) and varying drill pipe rotation speeds (0 to 90 rpm) was evaluated. Sweep efficiencies were compared in terms of the measurement of cuttings bed heights before and after circulating the sweep fluid.  The results indicate that significant improvement associated with higher fiber content requires a commensurate increase in drill pipe rotation speed. With lower or no pipe rotation speed, increasing fiber concentration yields less dramatic returns. Pairing high fiber content with rapid pipe rotation resulted in enhanced performance over the control sweep, which contained no fiber, but relatively low concentrations did not surpass the control.  With the increasing need in the industry to drill extended reach or otherwise inclined wells, there is greater potential to develop problems stemming from inadequate hole cleaning. This research gives insight into the specific interaction of sweep fiber and pipe rotation with the cuttings bed, and with each other. Deeper understanding of fiber sweeps would inform in-field decisions when dealing with poor hole cleaning.  Introduction Removal of cuttings is one of the fundamental tasks of drilling, recognized since the inception of rotary drilling. Now, deviated and horizontal wells are increasingly common. When cuttings travel through a non-vertical section, flow in the annulus must overcome an additional horizontal component of motion. This creates an accumulation within the wellbore known as a cuttings bed. Without remediation, hole pack-off, stuck pipe, and increased torque and drag are possible outcomes. In particular, irregular wellbore geometry, drill string eccentricity, and pump rate limitations can detract from hole cleaning efficiency. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract The increased application of multiphase flow in different industrial fields encouraged researchers to model the behaviors of multiphase flow in various ducts. Gasified (aerated) fluids, having 2-phases, are commonly used in drilling operations, especially for achieving underbalanced conditions. Although flow of two-phase fluids is studied in detail for pipes, not much is known for annular geometries.  In this study, extensive experiments have been conducted at Middle East Technical University (METU) Multiphase Flow Loop using air-water mixtures with various in-situ flow velocities of 0-120 ft/s and 0-10 ft/s respectively for wellbore inclinations of 75degree, 60degree, 45degree and 12.5degree without inner pipe rotation.  From the comparisons among data for total pressure losses,it is observed that in highly-inclined sections, by increasing the gas velocity in wellbore, the total pressure losses increase. For mid-range inclinations and nearly vertical sections, by increasing gas velocity, the total pressure losses decrease significantly, because the major part of total pressure gradient is the gravitational component. Based on experimental observations, a mechanistic model has been developed for determining the total pressure losses and volumetric distribution of each phase within the wellbore for a particular drilling condition.  It has been concluded that the proposed model is reasonably accurate for estimating the frictional pressure losses when compared with the measured values. In this paper, the experimental observations and the performance of the new mechanistic model have been presented and discussed in detail. Keywords: Two phase flow, Frictional Pressure Losses, Inclined Eccentric Annuli 1 Introduction In conventional drilling operations, the hydrostatic pressure of drilling fluid is more than the pore pressure in the formation rock. If a depleted or a sub-normal pressured formation is drilled with conventional methods, drilling fluid will tend to contaminate the formation, as well as problems like lost circulation, pipe stucking, etc. will likely to occur. In such cases, there are numerous advantages to use underbalanced techniques, i.e., gasified drilling fluids, to avoid potential problems. However, for drilling operations that are performed with fluids consist of gas-liquid mixtures, estimation of the pressure distribution within the wellbore and the performance of cutting transport is much more difficult than the single-phase fluids due to the characteristics of multi-phase fluid flow. If the wellbore is directional or horizontal, due to the potential cuttings bed development and complex flow pattern map developments, estimation of these variables are even more challenging. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the hydraulics of aerated fluid flow better in order to calculate accurately the desired bottom hole pressure and the optimal flow rates for drilling. This research is focused on the analysis of flow of aerated drilling fluids through large-scale inclined wellbores. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract One of the key objectives within the drilling industry is optimizing rate of penetration (ROP) and a major contributor to obtaining this objective is the PDC bit design. Whilst previous papers have proven that the PDC cutting structure geometry, particularly back rake and side rake angles, affect PDC bit performance when tested at atmospheric conditions, no information in the SPE literature exists for similar tests at confining pressures. The effect of side rake angle on cutter aggresiveness and cutter interaction at depths of cut (DOC) in excess of 0.04?? are particularly unknown under confined pressure.  The results of more than 150 tests show that back rake and side rake angles have substantial effects on Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the aggressiveness of PDC cutters. Experiments with three different rock types; Carthage marble, Mancos shale, and Torrey Buff sandstone, revealed that at both atmospheric and elevated confining pressures, PDC cutters with 10 deg back rake angles require half the energy to cut the same volume of rock and produce higher cutting efficiency compared with cutters having 40 deg back rake angles. Possible reasons for this behavior are explained through the analysis of the cutting process.  Results show that a cutter with low back rake requires less horizontal cutting force in order to cut the same volume of rock. This observation indicates that not only will a PDC bit with lower back rake angles, drill more efficiently, but it will also require less torque in order to drill at the same ROP. Other factors such as reduced durability of cutters at low back rake angles should also be considered while applying these results to PDC bit designs.  Test results at both atmospheric and confining pressures revealed that MSE decreases with increasing DOC up to 0.08?? on all three rock types. However, the tests also showed that MSE starts to increase slightly at DOCs above 0.08??, possibly suggesting an optimal minimum DOC.  Experimental results also show that, whilst Mancos shale and Carthage marble have about the same compressive strength, Mancos shale requires three times less energy to cut compared to Carthage marble. This indicates that, compressive strength of some rocks such as shales cannot be used alone as a reference rock property for accurately evaluating and comparing drilling efficiency.  A new 3D mechanistic PDC cutter-rock interaction model was also developed which incorporates the effects of both back rake and side rake angles, along with rock specific coefficient of friction. The results from this single-cutter model are encouraging as they are consistent with the experimental data. "

                    "abstract": "Pressure loss calculations have a vital role for determining hydraulic horsepower requirements and to predict bottomhole treating pressure. One of the major concerns in developing hydraulic programs is to estimate the frictional pressure losses while cuttings are present in the annulus during pipe rotation. An experimental work has been carried out in a cuttings transport flow loop capable of operating at various inclinations. The pressure drop in the test section was recorded for variable flow rates, cuttings concentrations, pipe inclinations and rotation speeds. Existence of cuttings increase the pressure drop due to decrease in flow area inside the wellbore. As there are cuttings in the system, pipe rotation decreases the frictional pressure loss considerably in particular if the pipe is making an orbital motion in the eccentric annulus. Cuttings bed thickness defined as the ratio of cuttings bed area to the wellbore area is expressed in terms of dimensionless parameters obtained from dimensional analysis. Empirical expressions and charts for friction factor are proposed for low and high viscosity fluids in terms of combined Reynolds number and stationary cuttings bed thickness. "

                    "abstract": "The annular frictional performance of non-Newtonian fluids is among the major considerations during development of hydraulic programs for drilling operations. Proper estimation of the frictional pressure losses become more critical when determining hydraulic horsepower requirements and selecting proper mud pump systems to foresee any serious problems that might occur with hydraulics during drilling operations. Because the rheological behaviour of the non-Newtonian fluids is known to be challenging, it becomes even more complicated during pipe rotation, especially in eccentric wellbores. In many cases, significant differences are observed when theoretical calculations and measurements for pressure losses are compared. This study aims to develop correction factors for determining the frictional pressure losses accurately in eccentric horizontal annulus for non-Newtonian fluid, including the effect of pipe rotation. Extensive experimental work has been conducted on METU-PETE Flow Loop for numerous non-Newtonian drilling fluids, including KCl-polymer muds and PAC systems for different flow rates and pipe rotation speeds, and frictional pressure losses are recorded during each test. Rheological characteristics of the drilling fluids are determined using a rotational viscometer. Observations showed that pipe rotation has a significant influence on frictional pressure loss, especially at lower flow rates. Up to a point, as the pipe rotation increases, the frictional pressure losses also increase. As the flow rates are increased, the effect of pipe rotation on frictional pressure losses diminishes. Also, after a certain pipe rotation speed, no additional contribution of pipe rotation on frictional pressure loss is observed. When the developed friction factors are used, there is a good agreement between the calculated and observed frictional pressure losses for any pipe rotation speed. "

                    "abstract": "Underbalanced drilling (UBD) is one of the most widely used technologies preferred in depleted and/or low-pressured formations. In order to achieve underbalanced conditions, drilling fluids are usually gasified. Major drilling fluids preferred during UBD are pure gas, gas-liquid mixtures, and foams. This study is focused on gas-liquid mixtures. As the gas is introduced, the behaviour of the drilling fluid becomes hard to explain for many reasons. First of all, gas is compressible and physical properties of gas are very sensitive to changes in pressure and temperature. Second, a multiphase flow phenomenon arises. When there is multiphase flow, flow patterns should be considered. It is known that there is a difficulty to predict hydraulic behaviour of gas-liquid mixtures owing to this flow pattern dependence. During a drilling operation, one of the parameters that should be considered is hole cleaning. Hole cleaning is a challenging task even for a single-phase drilling fluid. Moreover, there is still a lack of information about how the cuttings are transported when gas-liquid mixtures are used as drilling fluids. Flow-rate optimization during UBD operations for liquid and gas phases are usually conducted based on formation pressures only. However, considering only this criterion as the optimization objective is misleading and may cause serious problems during the drilling operation. In this study, gas and liquid flow rates during UBD operations are conducted not only based on formation pressures, but also based on effective hole cleaning. It is assumed that liquid phase is the major contributor for cuttings transport, and gas phase is only influencing the bottomhole pressure. A mechanistic model is introduced for estimating the hydraulic behaviour of gas-liquid mixture drilling fluids under different flow patterns. Based on the bottomhole pressure and effective hole cleaning point of view, an algorithm is proposed for estimation of the optimum required flow rates for liquid and gas phases based on the introduced mechanistic model. Also, the model predicts the required backpressure that has to be applied. "

If the fluid velocity is lower than a critical value at horizontal or high inclinations, a stationary bed develops which may cause various problems, such as high drag, higher probability of stuck pipe and higher hydraulic requirements, etc., if not removed properly. Therefore, this becomes important and essential to identifying critical velocity. This study aims to estimate the critical fluid-flow velocity for preventing the development of a stationary bed using empirical correlations that can be used easily at the field. Also, a rough estimation of bed thickness is introduced if the flow velocity is lower than the critical velocity. For this purpose, extensive cuttings transport experiments with water, called the Cuttings Transport Flow Loop, were conducted by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering Department at Middle East Technical University (METU) in order to determine various inclinations, flow rates and rate of penetrations. The inner pipe is subject to a sagging, therefore more realistic annulus representation is achieved. Observations showed that a stationary bed can be developed even when the inclination of the wellbore is down to 50°. Results showed that the critical velocity could be estimated using the proposed correlations with reasonable accuracy when compared with the experimental results. Also, for flow velocities less than the critical values, the thickness of the stationary bed can be detected mostly within an error range of ±15%. "

The process is formation specific. A Statistical method namely multiple linear regression technique is used for the drilling optimization methodology. An extensive literature survey on drilling optimization was conducted for this research study. A model is developed for this purpose using actual field data collected through modern well monitoring and data recording systems, which will be predicting the rate of drilling penetration as a function of available parameters. The rate of penetration general equation is optimized for effective functions at each data point. In order to optimize the parameters in the field, a computer network is required to be developed. The computer network will keep the piped data directly from the data source, and continuously be collecting the new data to be piped. A database present at the central computer will be continuously calculating the developed model parameters by means of multiple regression technique and inform the team at the field. The field engineer will transmit the current drilling parameters back to the central computer, and the headquarters will determine the new model parameters and optimum drilling parameters by including the recently received information. Therefore, there will be a real-time-optimization process. It is considered that this technique is going to be widely used in future drilling activities since it could reduce drilling costs and minimize probability of encountering problems due to working with optimized parameters. It has been found that drilling rate of penetration could be modeled in real-time environment as function of independent drilling variables such as weight on bit, rotation speed of the string, mud weight, and formation characteristics. The ability to have the drilling rate of penetration with respect to depth characteristically with certain parameters for specific formations on real-time basis could bring new insights to the nature of drilling operations.

                    "abstract": "The flow field in the liquid phase of high viscous oil and air two-phase slug flow were experimentally studied under laminar flow conditions. The horizontal 50.8-mm (2-in.) inner diameter (ID) pipe and high viscous fluid properties (nominal viscosity values of 0.51, 0.68 and 0.96 Pa·s) yielded mixture Reynolds numbers less than 100. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to analyze the flow field in the liquid phase. Slug characteristics were measured with a set of capacitance probes (CPs). Based on velocity field measurements, the liquid phase mass is shown to be conserved within the slug body despite local spatial variations in volumetric flow rate – flow accelerates at slug front and decelerates at slug tail. A low momentum region inside the liquid phase is identified beneath the mixing zone and close to the lower sections of the pipe. Furthermore, based on a frame of reference moving with the slug front, a pair of vortices is identified at the slug front. Accordingly, a continuous increase in velocity is observed at lower sections of the pipe. From CPs data, the flow coefficient is estimated to be between 2.11 and 2.20 for the elongated bubble flow, and 2.26 and 2.38 for the slug flow in laminar conditions investigated. From PIV data, the flow coefficient is estimated to be between 2.28 and 2.34 for the elongated bubble, and 2.31 and 2.44 for the slug flow, respectively. These slight differences in the obtained values of flow coefficient indicate the possible misunderstands of 1.13 multiplier. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid accumulation in deviated gas wells is a major challenge in production systems. Limitations with the use of gas lift, pumping or plunger lift methods add to this challenge. Recently, surfactants have been injected continuously or as batch to help with the well deliquification by foam generation. The batch treatment is done by intermittent application of soap sticks or liquid surfactants. This study is an effort to characterize surfactant batch treatment as an artificial lift method in horizontal gas wells. Given the practical potential and yet limited number of studies on this topic, the results can provide an experimental source to optimize surfactant application in mature production systems. The experimental study is performed in a 2-in ID facility consisting of a 64-ft lateral section with 1° downward inclination followed by a 41-ft vertical section. Water and compressed air are the liquid and gas phases, and an anionic surfactant is applied in batches at the heel of the well. First, static tests are conducted to analyze surfactant efficiency in well start-up conditions. The surfactant concentration, initial liquid loading level and gas rate are varied, and the final liquid loading volume is measured as the target parameter. Then, dynamic tests are conducted to mimic the flowing well conditions. Surfactant concentration, liquid and gas flow rates are varied, and pressure fluctuations at the toe are monitored with time. The surfactant batch is delivered after air-water flow stabilization to investigate the surfactant efficiency. In addition, a high speed camera is used to record the flow conditions. For well startup conditions, surfactant batch treatment is most effective for lower gas flow rates. Furthermore, the efficacy of surfactants is more pronounced at lesser-loaded wells. The effect of increasing surfactant concentration is eminent below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) with no further improvement beyond CMC. Generally, surfactant batch treatment does not significantly improve well cleanup time. During well production, surfactant batch treatment is most efficient in low liquid and gas flow rate systems. At increased liquid and gas flow rates, with increasing surfactant concentration, its use can be inefficient due to adverse effects caused by foam frictional pressure losses. When the surfactant batch treatment is efficient, its effect increases with increasing concentration until CMC is reached. During severe slugging, surfactant batch treatment eliminates the slug production phase and partially or fully eradicates the severe slugging depending on the severity of the slugs. Generally, no significant trends can be observed between the period of effectiveness and concentration of surfactant. "

                    "abstract": "In Arctic environment, ambient temperature can drop below the freezing point, which may lead to ice formation in the oil transportation pipelines. Natural hazards can also cause freezing in the liquid transportation system. The formation of ice can cause flow assurance and process safety issues, such as restricting flow path, pipeline plugging, failure of pipeline components, release of hazardous liquid, and fire. Restricting of flow path causes additional burden to upstream pumping system, while pipeline plugging leads to shutdown of the pipeline system and causes tremendous cost to remediate plugging. The incidents with hazardous liquid release and fire can also lead to enormous expenses. This paper investigates the risks of ice formation in the pipeline and its effect on the transportation system. The experimental tests were performed in a 2-inch diameter carbon steel flow loop. Pressure, temperature, and differential temperature were measured during the test. The experimental results show that an annular ice deposition layer was observed at the pipe inner wall, which restricted flow path and caused an increased differential pressure. The deposition of ice on pipe surface required a negative temperature gradient. Ice accumulations were identified at the low spot in front of the flow meter, the inserted thermocouples, and the perforated plate. The deposition and accumulation mechanisms are discussed. Both the ice layer on the pipe surface and ice accumulation at the pipeline components were porous, indicating the formation mechanism was due to small ice crystals sticking to the pipe surface. The study on deposition and plugging mechanism can help provide a guidance to prevent hazardous liquid transportation damages triggered by ice plugging. "

                    "abstract": "The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the fall velocities of several type of plungers in various stagnant liquids and at different dynamic operating conditions. Six different plungers were evaluated, namely, new and used brush, new and used dual pad, new and used spiral, and new two piece type plungers. The experimental studies were carried out using two different facilities. First, a simple plunger setup was used to measure the fall velocity of different plungers. This experimental configuration allows the use of different liquids at stagnant conditions (water, water with flowing air and oil). The experimental results show that plunger fall velocity in water is about 4% of the plunger velocity in air. Under a bubbling column and for all plunger types, the fall velocity fluctuates as the air passes through the plunger yielding, in some cases, an average velocity similar to the water case. The fall velocities in low and medium viscosity oils are 60% and 42% of the average velocity in water, respectively. Second, a comprehensive experimental facility was designed and constructed to study the plunger under dynamic operating conditions (or cycles) and at different fluid pressures (air). When the plunger fall velocity was studied under a cyclic operating conditions, the resultant fall velocity is about 60% of the velocity observed in only air, but 30 times larger than the corresponding velocity in stagnant oil. Comparatively, the fastest conventional plunger is the spiral type, whereas the conventional sealing types (pad and brush) are the slowest ones. In addition, the effect of pressure is substantial and the fall velocity of the plunger rapidly decreases as the gas phase (air) pressure increases. Based on the experimental observations and data analysis, it was found that the fall velocity depends mainly on the type of plunger, air phase pressure, thickness of the liquid film on tubing wall, viscosity of the liquid, and density of the gas phase. Plunger lift is one of the most used deliquification method for gas wells. However, only a few experimental studies have been found in the literature. None of them attempt the comparison of different plungers. This study present a new set of data that helps to understand the behavior of the different types of plungers. "

Parameters such as end of tubing location and packer placement are vital in determining efficacy of gas lift operations, alongside injection rate and injection location. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of these parameters. The scope of this study is to provide guidelines to help assist design of gas lift systems for toe down gas wells. A large scale experimental facility was constructed to study gas lift operations in toe-down gas wells. Air and water were used as test fluids, and the flow rates studied were those typically seen in toe down gas wells, resulting in slug flow being the dominant flow regime. Three end of tubing locations were studied, and in two of these locations the effect of a packer was quantified. Two different injection locations were studied as part of this study. Flow parameters such as pressure drop, holdup and slug characteristics were measured along the test facility. Experimental results indicated that gas lift operations do not significantly affect the behavior of flow parameters such as holdup and pressure, upstream of the point of injection. The most significant effect of gas lift is observed to be a reduction of pressure drop fluctuations downstream of the point of injection. Packer placement also significantly affects gas lift performance, and it was observed that packered configurations are more efficient. Also, for a given end of tubing location, gas lift injection at the deepest point is observed to be the most effective in reducing pressure drop fluctuations. This is the first experimental study conducted on the effect of end of tubing location and packer placement on gas lift operations on a large-scale test facility with field scale diameters for casing and tubing. Packer placement is currently dictated by mechanical concerns and depth limitations. This study addresses potential risks and benefits of running a packer as deep as possible, from a hydrodynamic standpoint. "

                    "abstract": "Foam lift has proven to be an effective method to mitigate liquid loading in unconventional resource (UCR) wells. Water-soluble surfactants are commonly used when liquid loading is mainly caused by formation water. There is a larger uncertainty involving the efficacy of water-soluble surfactant at water cuts below 80%. Therefore, oil-soluble surfactants are recommended. However, high oil-soluble surfactant price causes a significant increment in Opex, which can make the well production uneconomical. Flow loop tests have been carried out in a closed-loop 2″ ID facility to emulate continuous backside foam injection. The oil condensate is emulated using a low density commercial isoparaffin oil, while tap water and compressed air are used instead of formation water and natural gas. The experiments are conducted at water cut values that range between 70% and 100% for surfactant concentration of 250 ppm. The foamer surfactant is a commercial water-soluble surfactant that is commonly used in oil field applications. The liquid loading onset is primary parameter obtained from each test through video and data analysis. Other parameters such as flow pattern and pressure gradient are also reported. The experimental results show that liquid loading initiates at gas flow rates around 252 MSCFD for air-water flow in a 2-in. ID tubing. Adding the condensate fraction with a fixed total liquid rate and no surfactant slightly increases the critical gas rate. After surfactant injection, the reduction in critical gas flow rate is approximately 40% for most water cuts except the case of 70% water cut, where the oil presence seems to inhibit the surfactant effectiveness. Visual observations at this case show a significant reduction in generated foam, and relatively similar flow pattern transitions as the case of no surfactant. These results demonstrate that water-soluble surfactants are very effective in mitigating liquid loading at high water cuts, but their effectiveness reduces as water cut decreases. This causes an increase in the critical gas flow rate despite foam injection. Currently, most operators aim to produce from condensate-rich shale in order to increase profit. The results of this study offer a first look in the following two issues. First, the effect of oil in liquid loading is investigated and the effectiveness of surfactant at different water cuts is evaluated. Second, the results can be used to design cost effective treatments based on water-soluble surfactants. Most literature about the effect of water cut on surfactant injection effectiveness is based on small scale lab. This experimental study is one of the few flow loop tests to investigate the effect of oil on the onset of liquid loading with surfactant. "

The comparison shows a fair correspondence in terms of behavior and magnitude with the experimental results obtained by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). It was observed that the velocity profile is not fully developed near the bottom of slug body. Finally, extrapolation to the extended velocity conditions was performed. The reduction of translational velocity at higher mixture velocity conditions was investigated. A certain amount of gas passing from the tail to the front of the liquid slug body was visualized by three-dimensional velocity profiles. This phenomenon supports the reduction of translational velocity above the certain level of mixture velocity. "

Slug length and frequency along the well were measured using fourteen conductivity probes located along the test section. Experimental results indicated that slug length in the vertical and lateral sections of a well present values up to four and two times, respectively, larger than typical dimensionless slug length reported in the literature. Furthermore, slug flow development along the vertical section is affected by the lateral section deviation angle and length. At the same time, lateral section slug flow development is affected by liquid fall back from the vertical section and lateral section length. Slug characterization along the well is critical to properly design and operate downhole and surface equipment and properly predict pressure gradient and liquid holdup along the well. "

                    "abstract": "Pseudo-slug (PS) and churn (CH) flows are among the least understood flow patterns for gas-liquid flow in pipes, despite their importance in many engineering applications. Owing to visual differences, they are commonly perceived as different flow patterns. This study presents characterizations of these flow patterns, which suggests their analogous behavior, thus enabling possibility of unified modeling between them. The experiments were conducted using an air-oil (0.213 Pa.s liquid viscosity) system with a 0.0508-m ID, 21.7-m long, upward inclined polycarbonate test section under atmospheric pressure. Flow patterns were identified using the dimensionless voltage time-trace readings of two-wire capacitance probes, supplemented by high-speed camera observations. The capacitance probes were used for slug/ pseudo-slug/ churn flow characterizations. Additionally, capillary-seal differential pressure transmitters for pressure drop measurement and quick-closing-valves section for liquid holdup measurement were used. Experimental results demonstrate that despite their visual differences, PS and CH share several common characteristics. First, both PS and CH exist between slug (SL) and segregated flows (annular or stratified) as superficial gas velocity (vSG) changes in the flow pattern map. Second, non-monotonic relationships between translational and mixture velocities are observed for both flow patterns in contrast to linear behavior for conventional SL flow. Third, both flow patterns exhibit similar signature of capacitance probes time-trace data and its distribution histogram. Fourth, they show similar values of drift-flux flow distribution coefficient (C0). And fifth, a consistent bias tendency is observed when conventional SL flow models are used to predict the pressure gradient of both flow patterns. The visual difference between PS and CH may be attributed to higher frequency, wavier film interface, and more uniform pipe wetting exhibited by CH compared to PS flow due to inclination angle effects. Several SL to CH transition models are modified/ extended to predict SL to PS transition. The combination of Taylor bubble flooding and a unified slug flow model is found to predict the SL to PS transition accurately within the experimental range, further supporting the analogy between PS and CH.

Therefore, accurate prediction of the critical gas velocity that can avoid the liquid accumulation is of great importance. An experimental study of onset of liquid-film reversal, which is believed to be the main cause of liquid accumulation, was conducted in a hilly-valley test section at low-liquid-loading condition. A new, easily implemented mechanistic model to predict critical gas velocity, which is specifically developed based on the liquid-film reversal in stratified flow, is proposed in this work. The new model was verified with the data acquired in the study and other studies from the open literature, showing a fair agreement. This work also reviewed and evaluated other critical-gas-velocity-prediction models. The new model performs best compared with other models, especially in terms of the inclination angle and liquid-flow-rate effect on critical gas velocity. The total average absolute error was reduced 6.0% compared with the current best-prediction model (Zhang et al. 2003), and 38.2% for the widely used Turner et al. (1969) droplet-removal model. "

The model evaluates the thin film thickness based on the Nusselt falling film theory coupled with a liquid mass balance in the cross sectional area of the pipe. This coupling relates the rate of deposited droplets at the thin film with the atomization and deposition at the bottom liquid film.

                    "abstract": "Pseudo-slug flow is widely encountered in petroleum production systems, such as in upward inclined pipelines and deviated wells with liquid loading issues. To author's knowledge, there is no model yet available to predict the behavior of this flow pattern. This study presents a simple model to predict the design parameters of pseudo-slug flow (pressure gradient and liquid holdup). The modeling approach relies on the fact that pseudo-slug structure involves a continuous gas passage despite of apparent intermittency as a whole. Consequently, pseudo-slug flow is treated as a segregated flow with very large waves rather than a conventional slug unit cell. A modeling approach combining drift-flux and two-fluid models is proposed in this study. This method eliminates the need to arbitrarily prescribe the interfacial friction factor correlations for pseudo-slug, which would conceivably differ from those of stratified/ wavy/ roll-waves flow reported in literature. A new closure relationship is needed for pseudo-slug flow drift-flux coefficients, which are easily derivable from experimental data in literature. Iterative procedure requirement to run the proposed model is minimal, which is an advantage for practical application. Additionally, this modeling approach does not produce multiple solutions, which may be exhibited by conventional two-fluid model. Pseudo-slug flow experimental data are collected from literature for benchmarking purpose. The accuracy of pressure gradient and holdup predictions of the proposed model is better than two state-of-the-art multiphase flow simulators, which generally treat pseudo-slug as slug flow. The values of interfacial friction factor naturally emerge in the calculation instead of being prescribed by a closure relationship. These calculated values exhibit sensible physical relations with pseudo-slug characteristics observed experimentally. The closure relationships for drift-flux coefficients remain to be improved in the future as more pseudo-slug experimental data become available. "

Current two-phase slug flow models and their closure relationships are based on experimental data with low viscosity liquids (μL < 20 mPa s).

The new closure relationship is a function of both Froude and viscosity dimensionless numbers.

                    "abstract": "In slug flow modelling, the shear stress between the slug body and the pipe wall is one of the critical parameters to define the frictional pressure drop. Experiments were carried out in a 50.8-mm ID horizontal flow loop to identify the trend of the wall shear stress within the slug body for liquid viscosities of 0.51 Pa·s and 0.96 Pa·s. A new setup allowed accurate assignment of the signals from the Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA) to the corresponding positions in the slug body. Experimental evidence shows that arrival of the slug fronts do not indicate an immediate increase in the wall shear stress at the bottom of the pipe. INTRODUCTION Slug flow is a commonly encountered gas/liquid two-phase flow pattern in pipelines. In slug flow modelling, the shear stress between the slug body and the pipe wall is one of the important parameters for the estimation of frictional pressure drop. In many of previous modelling studies such as Dukler and Hubbard (1), constant wall shear stress values are predicted, and applied to develop and validate models. A more adequate wall shear stress measurement is required to investigate the possible effect of wall shear stress changes within the slug body. Additionally, the observation contributes to the analysis of eddy length in the mixing region, Nicholson et al. (2). In production system design, it is crucial to predict the slug characteristics correctly based on fluid properties and operational conditions. In predicting flow features, viscosity appears as an intrinsic variable in almost all slug flow models. These models are developed for low viscosity fluids. However, two-phase slug flow can exhibit significantly different behaviour for higher viscosity oils as reported by Gokcal et al (3), (4), Kora et al. (5), Brito et al. (6) and Kim (7). "

                    "abstract": "Multiphase flow mechanistic models are macroscopic conservation equations (mass and momentum) supported by several empirical closure relations. There are several empirical corelationsavailable for each closure relationship. The success of mechanistic models largely depends on the employed closure relationships. Although, ideally, the closure relationships are desired to be applicable for all operating conditions and fluids;however, in reality, it is difficult to find such universal closures due to empiricism involved in the development of the closureships. Until the development of universal closure relationships, another viable approach is to find different set of closure relationships for identifiably different flow conditions such as low liquid loading flow or high viscosity liquids. In this study, we present a procedure to test the performance of multiple closure relationships against available databases. As an initial application of the procedure, we have tested different combination of closure relationships in the Unified Model (Zhang et al., 2003) and identified the combinations of closures that produce the best model performance for low liquid loading conditions using the field data set consisting of the nineteen field measurements from Frigg to St. Fergus gas and condensates export line. The results of the 37,620 simulations were analyzed. The results showed that the original set of closure relationships used in Zhang et al. (2003) was not optimal for this particular set of data. Instead, a different set of closure relationships is proposed to improve the model's performance for these specific field cases. Total absolute average pressure drop deviation was reduced form 11% to 10%. Total absolute average liquid content deviation was reduced from 66% to 1%. Using the proposed procedure, with the availability of additional large-scale field data, the set of closure relationships can be further refined, and even the elusive goal of finding universal closure laws would be possible.

                    "abstract": "An experimental study is conducted in a 6-in. inner diameter (ID) high-pressure facility to investigate the pressure effects on two-phase oil-gas low-liquid-loading flow in horizontal pipes. The investigated flow characteristics include pressure gradient and liquid holdup. Total of 247 tests are conducted at five different operating pressures: 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 psig. The test fluids are nitrogen and mineral oil (Isopar-L). Superficial oil velocity ranges from 0.01 to 0.05 m/s, while superficial gas velocity ranges from 1.6 to 16.7 m/s depending on the operating pressures. Differential pressure transmitters, quick closing valves, visualization system, and dual Wire-Mesh Sensors (WMS) are used to acquire the data. The experimental data are analyzed and compared with the model predictions. Suggestions are made to improve the existing model. It is found that the operating pressure clearly affects pressure gradient. The effects of operating pressure on liquid holdup are insignificant for the investigated range. The performances of the transient multiphase-simulation software OLGA High Definition (Biberg et al. (2015)), standard OLGA version 2015 (Bendiksen et al. (1991)), the Tulsa University Fluid Flow Project (TUFFP) Unified Model version 2015 (Zhang and Sarica (2003)), and Xiao et al. (1990) models are tested against the acquired pressure gradient and liquid holdup data. The results from all models are in good agreement with experimental liquid holdup and pressure gradient data for stratified wavy flow. OLGA v2015 and TUFFP Unified Model v2015 have performed the best for annular flow. Modification of the interfacial velocity in the interfacial shear stress term in TUFFP Unified Model v2015 is suggested to partially account for the effects of the operating pressure. The new model predictions are compared with the experimental data from this study and studies from other sources. Significant improvements in the model predictions are observed in comparison with the TUFFP Unified Model v2015. Experiments at high pressures are very limited because of the high cost of these experiments. This paper provides a unique experimental data set for two-phase flow in a 6-in ID horizontal pipe at high operating pressure. In addition, the model comparison and development are given in this paper. "

Most experimental slug-liquid-holdup studies in the literature were conducted either by use of low-viscosity liquid for all inclination angles or high-viscosity liquid for horizontal and slightly inclined pipes, indicating a lack of experimental data for vertical flow of high-viscosity liquid. Therefore, the objective of this study is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the effect of oil viscosity on slug-liquid holdup in gas/liquid upward vertical flow, and to develop a new closure model to predict slug-liquid holdup in vertical pipes. In this study, experiments were conducted in a 50.8-mm inner-diameter (ID) vertical pipe for six oil viscosities: 586, 401, 287, 213, 162, and 127 mPa·s. A new slug-liquid-holdup closure model derived from Froude and inverse viscosity numbers was developed in this study for high-viscosity-liquid two-phase upward vertical flow. The proposed model was validated against independent experimental data and showed excellent prediction for high-viscosity data. Furthermore, the proposed model was compared with existing models that take into account the viscosity effects showing better performance. The new model was incorporated in the Tulsa University Fluid Flow Projects (TUFFP) unified model (all versions; Zhang et al. 2003b), improving the prediction of pressure gradient and average liquid holdup for high-viscosity upward vertical flow.

Experiments were conducted in a facility with a 2-in. ID and 62.6-ft. long lateral section and a 41-ft. vertical section, which mimics a horizontal well. Four well configurations were considered; namely, toe-down, toe-up, one-undulation with a sump and one-undulation with a hump. Additionally, different flow conditions were used to simulate the well production as the reservoir pressure depletes. The effect of well trajectory on the liquid removal was evaluated measuring the pressure gradient, liquid holdup, film reversal, and flow pattern. Experimental results indicate that under stable conditions, toe-up is the best configuration for the displacement of the produced fluids from the toe to the kick-off point. However, at very low gas flow rates, severe slugging is observed in this configuration. Furthermore, for the toe-down, one-undulation with a sump, and one- undulation with a hump configurations liquid loading is observed in both lateral and vertical sections of the well. Consequently, significant liquid accumulation and an eventual slugging condition are observed in the well. It was observed that the measured critical gas velocity to avoid liquid loading is lower than gas velocity at the minimum pressure gradient, indicating that minimum pressure gradient criterion is not enough to determine whether the well will be under stable or unstable conditions. Finally, toe-down configuration presents the largest liquid accumulation in the lateral section, indicating lower efficiency to remove liquids from the toe to the kick-off point. "

Mechanistic models have been developed and tuned to model the entire production system. Most existing two-phase-flow models are derived from experimental data with low-viscosity liquids (µL<20 mPa·s). However, behavior of two-phase flow is expected to be significantly different for high-viscosity oil. The effect of high liquid viscosity on two-phase flow is still not well-studied in vertical pipes.

The model predictions are compared to the experimental data of Karami et al. (2016a, b). These experiments were conducted with water or 51 wt% of MEG in the aqueous phase, and inlet aqueous phase fraction values from 0 to100%. Modeling of three-phase flow can be described as a combination of two-phase gas-liquid flow modeling, and a liquid phase oil-water mixing modeling. A mechanistic model is proposed to predict flow characteristics of three-phase stratified wavy flow in pipeline. For the gas-liquid interactions, Watson's (1989) combined momentum balance equation derivation was applied. However, the calculation procedure was reversed, and the wave celerity was assumed as an input, while interfacial friction factor was one of the model's outputs. The liquid-liquid interactions were modeled using a simple energy balance equation and shift in liquid phase center of gravity calculations. The liquid phases can be separated, partially mixed, or fully mixed. The bottom aqueous film velocity was calculated using the law of the wall formulation, and was used to calculate the flowing aqueous phase fraction. The model predictions of different flow characteristics for two and/or three-phase flows were compared with available experimental data. The pressure gradient, wave amplitude, and aqueous phase fraction predictions were in good agreement with the experimental data. However, the liquid holdup predictions were slightly under-predicted by the model. Overall, an acceptable agreement was observed for all cases. Most of the common multiphase stratified flow models are developed with the assumption of steady-state conditions and with constant interfacial friction factor value. This study proposes a novel method to model stratified flow. The predictions are in acceptable agreement with experimental data conducted under stratified wavy flow pattern conditions. "

However, the experimental data presented in this study show high entrainment values, exceeding 50% in some cases. This shows that neglecting entrainment phenomenon can introduce a major source of discrepancy into multiphase flow modeling predictions. This study improves the entrainment fraction predictions in three-phase stratified flow. The droplet entrainment in three-phase stratified flow in horizontal pipelines is experimentally investigated using a 0.152-m ID facility. The experiments are conducted under low liquid loading conditions, which is very commonly observed in wet gas pipelines. The oil-aqueous-gas flow experiments are initially performed without mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), and then repeated with 50 wt% of MEG in the aqueous phase to analyze the effects of MEG presence on entrainment. MEG is a commonly used inhibitor in oil industry, applied to avoid hydrate formation in offshore systems. Its impacts on multiphase flow droplet entrainment are investigated. The experimental range of this study covers superficial gas velocity (vSg) values from 17 to 23 m/s, superficial liquid velocity (vSL) values of 0.01 and 0.02 m/s, and inlet liquid stream aqueous phase fraction (APFin) values between 0 to 100%. Similar test matrix is completed for both water and water and MEG solution as the aqueous phase. An isokinetic probe system is used to measure the entrained droplet flux at different vertical positions in the gas phase. Liquid entrainment fraction is then estimated by means of volumetric averaging. The trends of the data with respect to input parameters are investigated. The two and three-phase entrainment fraction data are used for a correlation evaluation study. Performances of ten correlations for two-phase entrainment fraction are compared to the experimental data, and best performing correlations are identified. The correlation of Pan and Hanratty (2002) is modified in an effort to improve the entrainment fraction estimations. The predictions of the modified correlation are compared with the acquired data and datasets from the literature.

ID pipe with the experimental results has shown that none of the existing slug frequency models could predict the experimental results with even moderate accuracy. The empirical nature of the current slug models is the main reason for their poor performance. This study also shows significant gaps in the existing slug frequency models/correlations, namely: Introduction Slug flow is a very common flow pattern in pipelines and wellbores. It is characterized by an alternating liquid slug and gas bubble configuration. Slug frequency models are used as input parameters in several mechanistic slug flow models, such as Dukler and Hubbard (1975), Taitel and Barnea (1990), Sylvester (1987), Felizola and Shoham (1995), etc . Thus, the use of an accurate slug frequency model can potentially result in better pressure gradient predictions by the aforementioned slug flow models. Prediction of slug frequency is also important from a materials standpoint, as slugging can significantly increase erosion, corrosion, and fatigue in pipelines. In the following section, an overview of the slug frequency models reviewed in this study is presented. "

                    "abstract": "Foam lift is one of the most cost effective methodologies for unloading gas wells. The surfactants are either injected intermittently or continuously to lift the liquid to the surface. By reducing the gravitational gradient and increasing the frictional gradient, the critical velocity at which liquid loading occurs is shifted to lower gas velocities. Currently, we do not have a methodology to predict the critical velocity (at the transition boundary of annular and intermittent flow) and the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. To address this, we measured several foam flow characteristics in both small scale and large scale facilities. Small scale facility involved measurement of foam carryover capacity as a function of time and surfactant concentration. Large scale facility involved measurement of liquid holdup, pressure drop, fraction of gas trapped in foam and foam holdup in 40-ft 2-in. and 4-in. tubing. We developed closure relationships for liquid hold up, foam holdup, fraction of gas trapped in the foam and interfacial friction factor by combining the small scale data with the data collected in the large scale experiments. These closure relationships are applicable to four different surfactants tested. A new transition criterion was developed and successfully used to predict onset of liquid loading under foam flow. Using a force balance over the gas core in annular flow, we developed a new procedure to calculate the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. We compared our model results with actual measurements in the large scale facility. Our model was reasonably able to predict the pressure drop within ±30%. The reason for such a large variance is that the small scale facility was not able to capture all the characteristics of the foam which were observed in the large scale facility. It is very difficult to reproduce the foam characteristics exactly in two different experiments. This is discussed further in this paper. The procedure developed is the only one currently available to calculate the pressure drop under the foam flow conditions using the small scale data. It is superior to conventional annular flow pressure drop prediction models which are currently available in the literature. "

It was reported that ice delayed the restart of the Poplar pipeline system which gathers crude from Montanan and North Dakota (Sunne, 2015). Concerns of ice also exist in the Trans-Alyeska Pipeline System. The declining throughput makes the oil get colder much faster. If oil temperature is below the freezing point, ice forms, which may coat critical valves, accumulate in the pipe and restrict flow (APSC, 2011). This paper investigates the mechanisms of ice formation, its behaviors and impacts on oil transportation systems. A 2-inch inner diameter carbon steel flow loop was instrumented to measure pressure, temperature, and differential pressure. The effects of pipeline components, fluid properties, and water fractions were analyzed using the experimental setup. The experimental results show that ice formation can restrict flow at the low sport in front of the flow meter, the inserted thermocouples, and the perforated plate. Annular ice deposition was found at the pipe wall. The morphology of the deposition on the pipe wall was rime ice, indicating the deposition was due to small ice crystals sticking to the pipe surface.

The optimum EOT location methodology without artificial lift is validated with 2-in. flow loop data and applied to synthetic field-scale cases. This methodology postulates the minimum ?ptotal, defined as the difference between toe and wellhead pressure, should determine the optimum EOT location. The methodology is extended to incorporate reservoir coupling and liquid loading analysis to produce a more comprehensive EOT analysis. Liquid loading evaluation is necessary as the optimum EOT methodology may not indicate the liquid loading potential in the well. In the case where reservoir potential is integrated into the methodology, maximizing the well's gas flow rates is used as the optimization criterion. The modification of the methodology to determine the optimum EOT location with installed gas lift or Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) system is demonstrated. Gas lift can be used to reduce the ?ptotal or increase the in-situ gas velocity to avoid liquid loading. In ESP systems, EOT location plays a role in preventing gas lock from occurring in the ESP by utilizing the natural separation of liquid and gas at an appropriate EOT location. "

                    "abstract": "This paper presents the development, validation, and application of a novel methodology to detect when and where liquid loading occurs in horizontal gas wells. Proposed liquid loading onset model is based on two possible mechanisms, namely, liquid film reversal (Barnea 1986) and liquid wave growth (Taitel 1976). Additionally, the liquid entrainment in the gas core and the effect of deviation angle on the liquid distribution along the pipe circumference were considered (Brito 2015). Furthermore, a liquid loading onset detection methodology and software were developed to predict the critical gas velocity along the well trajectory as function of the expected gas and liquid production decline. This facilitates the determination of the time and location (when and where) liquid loading starts and what gas flow rates are required to avoid liquid accumulation at different points along the well. Several case studies, based on data from actual gas wells, are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology applicability for determining effect of well trajectory, completion, liquid flow rate, operating conditions, and tubing location on liquid loading along the well.

The experimental data were used to develop methodologies to determine the optimum EOT location for the observed flow types: stable and cyclic flows. Total pressure drop, liquid inventory and the two-phase flow hydrodynamic behavior were analyzed to determine the optimum EOT location criteria. Tubingless completion and four packerless EOT locations were tested using a transparent laboratory-scale flow loop facility resembling two horizontal well configurations: toe-up and toe-down with 1-in. tubing and 2-in. casing. Water and compressed air were used as test fluids with various constant flow rates under low pressure. Minimum total pressure drop in the well was used to determine the optimum EOT location for stable flow. Various total pressure drop vs. EOT location relationships were observed under different operating conditions. Under low gas flowrates, installing tubing may promote severe slugging (SS) for a toe-up system. EOT located at kick-off point may be preferred as it showed the least test number of points with SS behavior. In addition, this location generated the lowest liquid holdup in the tubing and backpressure to the lateral section in most cases. The observations to explain these findings and the comparison of the tested EOT locations in handling SS were discussed. "

                    "abstract": "Most gas wells produce some amount of liquid. The liquid is either condensate or water. At high rates, the gas is able to entrain liquid to the surface; however, as gas well depletes, the liquid drops back in a gas well (called liquid loading) creating a back pressure on the reservoir formation. Addition of surfactants to the well to remove liquid is one of the common methods used in gas wells. Liquid loading in vertical gas wells with and without surfactant application was investigated in this study. Anionic, two types of amphoteric (amphoteric I and amphoteric II), sulphonate and cationic surfactants were tested in 2-inch and 4-inch 40-feet vertical pipes. Pressure gradient and liquid holdup are measured. Visual observation with a high speed camera was used to gain insight into the direction of foam flow in intermittent flow and foam film flow under annular flow conditions. Liquid loading is initiated when the liquid film attached to the wall in annular flow starts flowing downwards. Introduction of foam causes the gas velocity at which film reversal occurs to decrease; this shift increases with increasing surfactant concentration and it is more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. That is, the benefit of surfactants is much more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. The reason for postponement of liquid loading is reduction in the liquid holdup at low gas velocities which reduces the liquid holdup in foam flow compared to air-water flow. However, at higher gas velocities, the pressure drop in 2-inch compared to 4-inch pipe increases rapidly as the surfactant concentration increases. The selection of optimum concentration of the surfactant is a balance between the reductions in the gas velocity at which liquid loading occurs compared to increase in the frictional loss as the concentration increases. We provide guidelines about the selection of the surfactant concentration. Visual observations using high speed camera show differences in the behavior under foam flow conditions. Unlike air-water flow, the liquid film attached to the wall is replaced by thick foam capturing the gas bubbles. The type of roll waves which carry the liquid in 2-inch pipe is different than what was observed in 4-inch pipe. Compared to 4-inch pipe, the roll waves in 2-inch pipe are much thicker. This partly explains the differences in 2-inch versus 4-inch pipe behavior. "

The frictional pressure gradient is directly related to the wall shear stress, and it is usually negative (opposite to the overall flow direction). However, in vertical slug flow, the average total wall shear stress of a slug unit may be negative (in the same direction of the overall flow), resulting in a positive frictional pressure gradient. However, this does not mean, by any way, generation of additional energy or violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The positive frictional pressure gradient phenomenon, reasons and required conditions were explained in this paper. A simplified model was developed and validated against recent experimental data of air-high viscosity oil slug flow in a 50.8 mm ID vertical pipe. The oil viscosity was in the range of 127 mPa s to 580 mPa s. Positive frictional pressure gradient appears when the liquid film wall shear stress supersede the wall shear stress in the slug body. The rate of increase of both wall shear stresses (with respect to the mixture Reynolds number) depend, not only, on the mixture Reynolds number but also, highly, on the liquid viscosity. "

The experiments are conducted under low-liquid-loading condition, which is very commonly observed in wet-gas pipelines. The analyzed flow characteristics include wave pattern, liquid holdup, water holdup, pressure gradient, and wetted-wall fraction. The experimental range covers superficial-gas-velocity (vSg) values of 8 to 23 m/s, superficial-liquid-velocity (vSL) values of 1 to 2 cm/s, and inlet-liquid-stream water-cut values of 0 to 100%. Differential-pressure transmitters, a quick-closing valve and pigging system, and a high-speed camera are used to acquire the data. The trends of the data with respect to input parameters are investigated. The performances of commonly used models are compared with liquid-holdup, pressure-gradient, and water-holdup experimental results. The observed wave patterns include stratified smooth and stratified wavy with 2D waves, 3D waves, roll waves, and atomization flow. The transitions between the flow patterns vary as a function of water cut. The trends of pressure gradient, liquid holdup, and water holdup with respect to vSg, vSL, and water cut are observed, and interpretations on the basis of physics are provided.

Investigation is performed in laboratory and in-situ experiments under stagnant conditions with an emphasis on the effect of the mesh grid orientation on the measurements. Also, potential impact of misalignment in the pipe inclination is explored by slightly inclining the pipe for both tests. Finally, dynamic flow conditions are tested in a high pressure (1.37 MPa) facility with horizontal stratified-wavy oil/air two-phase flow for gas and liquid superficial velocity ranges of 2.8 m/s≤νSg≤6.9 m/s and 0.01 m/s≤vSL≤0.05 m/s, respectively. The angle between the phase interface and the sensor wires is ineffective while the misalignment in the pipe inclination plays a major role in the deviations of the holdup measurements. Using the proposed methodology, the measurement uncertainty from laboratory tests is shown to follow a logarithmic increase as a function of the measured holdup for smaller holdup values (HL≤15%) and to be lower than 1.5% for HL>15%. This behavior is intrinsic to WMS and a representative of the measurement uncertainty in the actual flow loop installation. Under actual flow conditions, the holdup measurements of the trapped liquid by WMS show an offset compared to the measurements via flow imaging which can be corrected by using the uncertainty quantified in the laboratory tests. However, the dynamic measurements with WMS show a good agreement with the holdup of the trapped liquid volume within the quantified uncertainty bounds. "

                    "abstract": "Wire-mesh sensors (WMS), developed at HZDR [4], [13], are widely used to visualize two-phase flows and measure flow parameters, such as phase fraction distributions or gas phase velocities quantitatively and with a very high temporal resolution. They have been extensively applied to a wide range of two-phase gas–liquid flow problems with conducting and non-conducting liquids. However, for very low liquid loadings, the state of the art data analysis algorithms for WMS data suffer from the comparably low spatial resolution of measurements and from boundary effects, caused by e.g. flange rings – especially in the case of capacitance type WMS. In the recent past, diverse studies have been performed on two-phase liquid–gas stratified flow with low liquid loading conditions in horizontal pipes at the University of Tulsa. These tests cover oil–air flow in a 6-inch ID pipe and water–air flow in a 3-inch ID pipe employing dual WMS with 32×32 and 16×16 wires, respectively. For oil–air flow experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.2 m/s≤νSG≤15 m/s and 0.01 m/s≤νSL≤0.02 m/s, respectively [2]. In water–air experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.1 m/s≤νSG≤33.5 m/s and 0.03 m/s≤νSL≤0.2 m/s, respectively [17], [18]. In order to understand the stratified wavy structure of the flow, the reconstruction of the liquid–gas interface is essential. Due to the relatively low spatial resolution in the WMS measurements of approximately 5 mm, the liquid–gas interface recognition has always an unknown uncertainty level. In this work, a novel algorithm for refined liquid–gas interface reconstruction is introduced for flow conditions where entrainment is negligible. "

Experiments were conducted for the low-liquid loading horizontal flow in large diameter pipe indicative of wet gas transportation pipelines. The flow loop consisted of 0.015 m (6 in.) diameter and 56 m long horizontal pipe. A backlit high speed visualization system was developed to capture images of the entrained drops. The images were processed and analyzed to determine drop size distribution. Images were captured at three different locations along vertical axis of the pipe, and distribution of the entrained liquid drops at each location was analyzed. The changes in size distribution and average size of drops along the vertical axis were studied at different gas flow rates. Upper limit log normal (ULLN) distribution and log normal distribution were used to fit experimentally determined size distribution. Stratification of drops was observed and average drop size was found to decrease from bottom to top of the pipe. The spatial variation tended to decrease with increase in gas velocity. Experimentally determined drop sizes were greater than those predicted by available correlations for Sauter mean diameter (SMD), volume median diameter and maximum diameter. The error tended to increase from bottom to top of the pipe. The discrepancy could be because most of the available correlations are empirical based on data for air-water flow, which is a high-surface tension system, and commonly for vertical annular flow. Accurate estimation of size of entrained drops is necessary for prediction of their concentration distribution across the pipe cross-section and fraction of liquid entrained in the gas phase. This is required for prediction of pressure gradient and liquid holdup and evaluating flow assurance risks in condensate pipelines. "

Air and water were used as fluids. The surfactant used was a foaming agent capable of forming stable foams in all brines for a wide range of pH values. Pressure behavior in the flowline/riser system was monitored, and input-gas-, injection-gas-, liquid-, and surfactant-flow rates were measured continuously. In addition, visual observations were made to identify severe slugging. Effects of the proposed method were quantified with a modified elimination performance index (MEPI) that considered not only pressure fluctuations, but also backpressure effects. Thirty tests were conducted. The data were analyzed for the severe-slugging suppression of the combination of surfactant and gas lift, the effect of gas lift on surfactant injection, and the effect of the surfactant on the reduction of the gas lift gas. The combination technique with the highest gas lift rate completely eliminated the severe slugging for all tests conducted. Surfactants were able to suppress severe slugging for most of the cases. The performance of the \"only-surfactant injection case\" increases as the gas/liquid ratio increases. For all of the tests, backpressure reduction was observed. The MEPI is used as the main parameter to assess the performance of the severe-slugging-suppression methods. Gas lift not only contributes to density reduction through volumetric increase of gas in the riser, but it also reduces the mixture density by promoting more foam generation. There were reductions in the gas lift rate from the original maximum gas lift injection rate for all the tests conducted with surfactant injection. "

The liquid holdup, liquid film height, wetted wall perimeter decrease with the increasing superficial gas velocity. The interfacial surface area is calculated from the distinct interface between the phases from the experimental data without any assumptions on the interface geometry. The variation of the interfacial surface area is found to be closely related to the liquid holdup. The region where the interface fluctuations spread in the pipe cross-section is analyzed. For low gas flow rates, a small region exists where the fluctuations are negligible implying a continuous liquid contact with the pipe bottom. However, an increase in the superficial gas velocity extends the spatial reach of the interface fluctuations very close to the pipe wall at the bottom where the continuous liquid region diminishes. For all experimental conditions examined, the interface fluctuations occurring at a frequency range of 10 Hz < f < 40 Hz is hypothesized to be related to the capillary waves. At low superficial gas velocities, the roll wave topology is stretched toward the sides of the pipe. Moreover, the oscillations of these waves at different transverse locations are out-of-phase.

Mechanisms describing liquid loading initiation are not well understood for inclined pipes or deviated wells. Knowing the effect of pipe inclination over the liquid-loading initiation will help for the development of a predictive tool for flow assurance, well production forecast as well as remediation techniques enhancing gas production. An experimental study of low liquid loading has been conducted for 90°, 75°, 60° and 45° inclined pipes. Air/water flow in a 3-in ID pipe has been investigated. Pressure gradient and average liquid holdup were measured. Visual observations with high and low speed cameras have been recorded to identify flow patterns and liquid film behavior for each test point. Pipe inclination effects on critical gas velocity for flow pattern transition have been investigated. The critical gas velocity represents the maximum gas flow rate where the liquid loading is observed. This critical velocity increases as pipe inclination deviates from vertical. Pressure gradient fluctuations and liquid film flow behavior are closely related with liquid loading initiation. As the pipe deviates from vertical and owing to the increasing liquid film thickness at the bottom of the pipe, slug and churn flow patterns are promoted. Therefore, the existing critical velocity prediction models, which ignore the circumferential variation of film thickness, produce significantly different values of critical velocities when compared with the experimental data. Liquid loading is one of the main problems that the industry faces during the production of natural gas wells and transportation of low liquid loading gas-liquid flow through a riser. This study serves as a foundation for future model developments to avoid and remedy liquid loading related problems in risers and gas wells. "

Using the principles of Nodal Analysis, it was observed that the use of downhole venturi nozzles significantly improved the stability of production.

Flow through the nozzles was characterized using CFD simulations and a sizing methodology has been proposed. Foam flow was studied for injection before and after the nozzle at very low concentrations of a commercial foamer. The presence of the nozzle during foam flow did not affect the pressure gradient or holdup characteristics significantly when compared to foam flow without nozzle.

                    "abstract": "Slug liquid holdup is one of the most important parameters of slug flow. It is closely related to the average liquid holdup and pressure gradient of slug flow in wells and pipelines. The mechanistic models of Barnea and Brauner (1985) and of Zhang et al. (2003a) are based on the turbulent liquid-slug assumption for low-viscosity oils. However, for high-viscosity oil, the liquid slug is laminar because of the low slug Reynolds number. In this study, a mechanistic slug-liquid-holdup model is developed for low- and high-oil-viscosity slug flows. The model is based on two shear mixings: shear mixing between the slug front and pipe wall and shear mixing between the slug body and liquid film. The model uses slug-flow characteristics that can be calculated by solving the continuity and momentum equations of slug flow. A data bank consisting of 418 slug-liquid-holdup measurements that were obtained from various authors is used to analyze and validate the model. In the data bank, liquid viscosity ranges from 0.0016 to 0.589 Pa·s (1.6 to 589 cp). Pipe-inclination angle ranges from –30° to upward vertical. Pipe inside diameter varies from 5.08 to 10 cm. Statistical evaluations are conducted and compared with predictions of other models, and significant improvement is observed in the performance of the new model. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading, which can lead to rapid gas-rate decline and can even cease gas production, is a common phenomenon found in most mature gas wells. An accurate prediction of the inception of liquid loading is of great interest to operators, for the reason that remedial measures can be applied in a timely manner to prevent such conditions from being realized, thereby extending the production life of a gas well. However, the mechanism that is responsible for liquid loading still remains controversial. In the literature, at least three different definitions of liquid loading exist. The first definition is based on the intersection of inflow and outflow curves, the second definition is based on the reversal of entrained liquid droplets, and the third definition is based on the reversal of liquid film. These definitions yield different results when predicting the inception of liquid loading. In this paper, a new definition of liquid loading is introduced. This new definition is based on the relative contributions of gravity and residual pressure drop, and it is validated by its agreement with air/water experimental data. A new comprehensive model is developed that is based on the Barnea (1986, 1987) model. For vertical wells, the new model can better predict the inception of liquid loading than the widely used Turner et al. (1969) equation. For deviated wells, it is observed in the field and in laboratories that liquid loading starts much earlier than in vertical wells, and most liquid-loading equations are not appropriate for deviated wells. The new model takes into account the nonuniform film thickness around the circumferential position of the pipe, and, thus, it improves the prediction of liquid loading in deviated wells. The new model is validated through the use of field data in the literature and experimental data obtained at the University of Tulsa. In addition to the literature data, a new set of field data is reported and used to validate the new model, which shows a significant improvement over the droplet model as well as other film models.

                    "abstract": "Introduction The combination of declining reservoir pressure and increasing water production in aging fields along with certain common pipeline/riser geometries can create or exacerbate riser slugging. The severity of riser slugging typically becomes worse with increasing riser height and may be especially problematic for some aging deep-water production systems. Severe riser slugging is characterized by large fluctuations of liquid (oil and water) and gas production arriving at the topsides first stage separator. The severe slugging cycle is divided in four steps as described in Figure 1. The classic pipe geometry for severe slugging is a slightly downward section upstream of a riser. In step 1, gas and liquid velocities are low enough to allow stratified flow in the downward sloping pipe section followed by liquid bridging and accumulation at the bottom of the riser. The hydrostatic pressure of the accumulated liquid initially increases equal to or faster than the build-up of gas pressure upstream of the liquid plug (Step 2). When the gas pressure eventually exceeds the hydrostatic head of the liquid slug, the gas will begin to push the liquid plug out of the riser and start to penetrate the riser (Step 3). The pressure in the gas reduces as the liquid is removed from the riser and the gas expands increasing the velocities in the riser. After most of the liquid and gas exits the riser, the velocity of the gas is no longer high enough to sweep the liquid upwards. Liquid film not swept from the riser starts falling back down the riser (Step 4) and the accumulation of liquid starts again. "

It is closely related to the average liquid holdup and pressure gradient of slug flow in wells and pipelines. Barnea and Brauner (1985) and Zhang et al. (2003a) mechanistic models are based on the turbulent nature of liquid slugs, which is typical for low viscosity oils. However, for high viscosity oil slug flow, the liquid slug is laminar due to low slug Reynolds number. In this study, a slug liquid holdup mechanistic model is developed for low and high viscosity oil slug flows. The model is based on two shear mixings including shear between the slug front and pipe wall, and shear between the slug body and liquid film. The equations are solved based on slug flow characteristics which can be calculated by solving the continuity and momentum equations of slug flow.

Significant improvement is observed in the performance of the new model. Introduction Heavy oil constitutes a major portion of the world's total oil reserve. It is discovered and produced around the world and has become one of the most important future hydrocarbon resources with ever increasing world energy demand and depletion of conventional oils. However, heavy oil possesses very high viscosity which poses many challenges for its production and transportation. Accurate pressure gradient and liquid holdup predictions of high-viscosity oil multiphase pipe flows are imperative for heavy oil production and transportation. Most of the current multiphase flow experimental studies, correlation and model developments were conducted using low-viscosity conventional oils or other liquids. However, high-viscosity oil multiphase flow behaves very differently than low-viscosity oil multiphase flow. Significant discrepancies were observed in model comparisons. Slug flow is a dominant flow pattern in high-viscosity oil/gas pipe flow. In two-phase slug flow, liquid slugs and gas pockets propagate alternatively in the pipe. Liquid slugs without gas entrainment are rare under normal pipeline operating conditions. Instead, gas bubbles are often entrained in the liquid slugs. The liquid volume fraction in the slug body is known as the slug liquid holdup. The slugs can carry different amount of entrained gas, which primarily depends on flow rates, fluid properties, and pipe diameter. A slug unit consists of the slug body and a liquid film zone. The fast moving aerated slug body over rides the slow moving liquid film ahead of it. The slug scoops the liquid film and accelerates it to the velocity of the slug (mixture velocity). Liquid is shed from the tail of the slug to a trailing film. Slug liquid holdup is an important parameter for slug flow modeling. Most of the pressure drop in slug flow occurs in the slug body. The frictional pressure drop is greater in the slug body than in the film region. The liquid film acceleration also causes significant pressure drop in the mixing zone at the slug front. Thus the overall pressure gradient depends greatly on the slug liquid holdup and slug length. "

Introduction In oil/gas production and transportation, gas/liquid two-phase flow is frequently observed.  Accurate understanding of two-phase flow characteristics helps in the design and optimum operation of pipeline and downstream facilities. In two-phase flow, flow pattern depends on gas and liquid flow rates, pipe diameter, inclination, and fluid properties.  In near horizontal pipes the flow patterns can be classified as stratified smoth, stratified wavy, slug, elongated bubble, annular and dispersed bubble flow.  Flow parameters such as pressure gradient and liquid holdup are flow pattern dependent.  Thus, systematic studies of the effect of fluid properties, operational condition and pipe geometry is essential for better understanding of two-phase flow behavior. In the past, most of the studies in two-phase flow were carried out for low viscosity liquids (less than 0.02 Pa.s), which generally occur during production of light hydrocarbons.  At present, 60% of the available oil reserves correspond to heavy oils, which possess high density and viscosity.  Additionally, the existing multiphase flow models and correlations were developed using data collected for low viscosity oils with viscosities.  Hence, these models may not be applicable to high viscosity multiphase flow.  The following brief literature review summarizes the most relevant experimental and modeling efforts for two-phase flow in pipes. Sevigny (1962) conducted a comprehensive study of two-phase flow in inclined pipes.  Air and water were the test fluids in 20 mm ID pipe with varying pipe inclinations.  He found that pressure gradients are greatly affected by inclination angles.  Later, Bonnecaze et al. (1971) developed a model for two phase flow in inclined pipeline and claimed that the pressure drop was a strong function of the liquid holdup in the slug unit.  Soon after, Beggs (1972) used a 50.8 and 62.9 mm ID pipe and carried out a study of inclination effects.  He experimentally showed that liquid holdup was strongly affected by pipe inclination angle. Mattar and Gregory (1974) conducted experiments to find the effect of inclination on slug velocity, holdup and pressure gradient.  They found that for uphill pipe sections, slug flow was the predominant flow pattern, and for downhill pipe sections stratified flow dominated.  They also observed that hydrostatic head for slug flow dictated pressure gradient in uphill sections.  Later, Spedding and Chen (1981) experimentally studied the pressure drop in two phase flow in inclined pipe corroborating the relationship between flow pattern and pressure drop.

Tulsa city natural gas was used to pressurize the facility to 250 (+20) psig. Superficial oil velocity ranged from 0.1 to 1 m/s and superficial water velocity ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 m/s. Experimental measurements obtained are pressure gradient and water holdup. Pipe viscometer was used to obtain live oil viscosity measurements. Flow patterns were observed through a sapphire window and recorded with a high speed video system. The experimental measurements and observations are used to compare with mechanistic model predictions to identify the deficiencies in the models.  Introduction Global heavy oil and other unconventional oil reserves are estimated to be exceeding conventional oil reserves by a large margin. Conventional oils also exhibit high viscosity at lower temperatures corresponding to cold climate conditions. Mechanistic models are widely used in petroleum industry to predict oil/water flow behavior. These models have been developed and validated based on low-viscosity oil data. This is due to limited experimental data available for high viscosity oil/water flow.  Accurate model predictions of oil/water flow behavior including pressure drop, flow patterns and liquid holdups in pipes of different inclination angles are essential for production system design. The following brief literature review summarizes experimental and modeling work done for oil/water flow.  Trallero (1995) conducted experimental studies of oil/water flow in a 2-in ID horizontal pipe. He observed 6 different flow patterns: stratified flow (ST), stratified with mixing at the interface (ST&MI), dispersion of oil in water over a water layer (DO/W&W), dispersion of oil in water (O/W), dispersion of water in oil (W/O) and dual dispersions (DW/O&DO/W). He also developed a new mechanistic model for oil/water flow pattern transition which performed well for oil/water flow in horizontal pipes.  Several experimental studies of oil/water pipe flow have been conducted including Flores (1997), Angeli et al. (1998), Alkaya (2000), Lum et al. (2004) and Atmaca (2007). These studies cover a wide range of water cuts from 0 to 100% and mixture velocities up to 4 m/s. The test fluids in most cases were mineral oil with viscosities up to 50 cP and tap water. Flow regimes observed varied from stratified flow to dual dispersions. Measurements including pressure drop and holdup were used to validate existing mechanistic models and new models were proposed.  Brauner (2001) developed a unified approach for transition from stratified to dispersed flow patterns in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems. It is based on different models predicting maximum drop sizes in dense dispersions. Eötvös number was determined to be the critical dimensionless parameter affecting the range of applicability of these different models. Other dimensionless parameters affecting the transition include Reynolds number, Weber number, flow rates ratio, viscosity ratio and density ratio. "

                    "abstract": "Using a visualization prototype built from original electrical-submersible-pump (ESP) components and with minimal geometrical modifications, a pioneer experimental procedure was developed and conducted to address the viscous effect on liquid/gas two-phase flow through these types of pumps. Based on dimensionless groups that govern centrifugal-pump single-phase performance, two-phase experiments were conducted at different shaft speeds (15, 25, and 30 Hz), with nonslip void fractions (up to 5%), and viscosity values of 46 to 161 cp, while liquid rates were kept constant at 60% of the maximum rate at the defined shaft speed. High-speed video footage was taken from the entire impeller flow channel, and stage incremental pressure was measured. The authors identified four liquid/air flow patterns inside the impeller channels: agglomerated bubbles, gas pocket, segregated gas, and intermittent gas. By comparing the images with the differential-pressure data, it was concluded that the agglomerated-bubbles pattern is responsible for the initial head degradation and that the surging event coincides with the gas-pocket structure, indicating that this is an interface-instability problem. Another conclusion made was that the increase in viscosity caused surging to occur at lower void fractions, which could be compensated for by increasing rotational speed. The significance of this work is given by the fact that several authors hae investigated centrifugal-pump performance under two-phase flow; however, previous experiments have been conducted only with water as the liquid, thus neglecting the viscous effect on the two-phase-flow mixture. In most of the petroleum industry's applications, ESPs operate with oil and natural gas. The present work begins the task of addressing this knowledge gap between scientific research and field applications. "

Experimental data gathered shows the effect of volumetric gas flow rate and intake-stage pressure for different rotational speeds.

A sudden reduction in the stage-pressure increment is observed at this operation condition for a certain critical liquid flow rate, which marks the initiation of surging on the stage performance as mentioned by Lea and Bearden (1982). The surging initiates at lower liquid flow rates as the volumetric gas flow rate increases, which demonstrates the relationship between the surging initiation and liquid flow rate. It is also observed that the initiation of the surging moves toward lower liquid flow rates by increasing the rotational speed or the stage intake pressure. A two-phase stage-performance map was recently introduced, defining boundaries for five pump-performance regimes: homogenous, mild-performance deterioration, performance reverse slop, server performance deterioration, and nil performance (Gamboa and Prado 2011b). The current work shows that these performance regime boundaries are affected by rotational speed and intake-stage pressure. "

Consequently, the two-phase pump head is associated with whether the stage operates under conditions prior (mild performance deterioration) or after (severe performance deterioration) the surging point.  The surging, for engineering purposes, can be predicted by published correlations, but the lack of theoretical basis is a limiting factor for their application.

This paper reviews some of these correlations and mechanistic models by comparing its predictions against experimental data acquired in a closed loop with water and air utilizing a commercial 24 stages ESP. The data cover a wide range of volumetric gas fraction, rotational speeds and intake pressures. As consequence of this analysis, two correlations have been formulated. The first correlation predicts the surging as function of rotational speed and fluid properties, while the second correlation intends to predict the homogenous boundary. This boundary encloses a regime in which the homogenous model works for predicting the ESP head curve.  Introduction Lea and Bearden (1980) classified the two-phase performance of an ESP into four categories: non-gas interference, gas interference, intermittent gas lock and gas lock. The operating condition that marked the onset of the intermittent gas locking regime was termed surging by these authors. The surging then became important for practical purpose because the pump head breakdown coincided with this operating condition.  Schadeva (1990) hypothesized the surging occurred once the gas velocity into the impeller became zero. Thus, the author explained the formation of a stagnant gas pocket at impeller inlet region. The pump head breakdown was then a consequence of the gas pocket formation. Schadeva (1990) proposed that the surging could be determined by forcing the gas velocity to zero in his one-dimensional model of the pump head. This model requires detail information about the internal components of the pump that is considered confidential information for most pump manufacturer. Therefore, this model is not suitable for practical applications. Minemura et al. (1993b) observed that the pump head breakdown is caused by a flow pattern transition from a bubbly flow to slug-flow-like flow pattern. By analogy to two-phase flow in pipe, Minemura et al. (1993b) argued that it may occur at a certain critical gas void fraction. Based on simulations, the authors realized the critical gas void fraction at which the surging occurred changed as a function of liquid flow rate. Then, the critical gas fraction could not be determined based on operating conditions and geometry but experimental data is required.  Estevam (2001) observed the stage head breakdown occurred when a gas pocket was formed at the pump intake as Murakami and Minemura (1974a) mentioned. The pump performance became unstable at higher volumetric gas fraction than the surging as mentioned by Lea and Bearden (1980). Based on his visualization study of fluid flow into the pump Estevam (2001) classified the pump operation in bubby flow, transition and elongated bubble. The surging is then defined as the transition between bubbly flow and the transition regime by this author. Estevam (2001) observed that the bubble size flowing through the impeller increases with the increase of volumetric gas fraction as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974b). He noticed bubbles reach a critical size at the surging, which ranged between 2 mm and 3 mm. "

                    "abstract": "The ESP system is an important artificial lift method commonly used for medium- to high-flow-rate wells for subsea developments. Multiphase flow and viscous fluids can cause severe problems in pump applications. Free gas inside an ESP causes operational problems and lead to system failures. Under two-phase flow conditions, loss of pump performance or gas lock condition can be observed. Under viscous fluids, the pump performance degrades as well.  This paper provides a model on the effects of viscosity and two phase (liquid & gas) fluids on electric submersible pumps (ESPs), which are multistage centrifugal pumps for deep boreholes. The theoretical study includes a mechanistic model based on Barrios (2011) for the prediction of the degradation due to bubble accumulation. The model comprises a one-dimensional force balance to predict occurrence of the stagnant bubbles at the channel intake as a main cause of deviation from homogeneus flow model.  The testing at Shell's Gasmer facility revealed that the ESP system performed as theoretical over the range of single flowrates and light viscosity oils up to Gas Volume Fractions (GVF) around 25%. ESP performance observed gas lock condition at gas fraction higher than 45%. Homogeneous Model has a fairly good agreement with pump performance up to 30% GVF. Pump flowrate can be obtained from electrical current and boost for all range of GVF and speed. Correlation depends strongly in fluid viscosity and pump configuration.  The main technical contributions of this study are the determination of flow patterns under two important variables, high viscosity and two-phase flow inside the ESP to predict operational conditions that cause pump head degradation and the beginning of bubble accumulation that lead to surging Barrios (2011). For similar applications, pump performance degradation can be predicted in viscous environment and two-phase flow conditions. "

The horizontal 50.8-mm (2-in.) inner diameter (ID) pipe and high viscous fluid properties (nominal viscosity values of 0.51, 0.68 and 0.96 Pa·s) yielded mixture Reynolds numbers less than 100. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to analyze the flow field in the liquid phase. Slug characteristics were measured with a set of capacitance probes (CPs). Based on velocity field measurements, the liquid phase mass is shown to be conserved within the slug body despite local spatial variations in volumetric flow rate – flow accelerates at slug front and decelerates at slug tail. A low momentum region inside the liquid phase is identified beneath the mixing zone and close to the lower sections of the pipe. Furthermore, based on a frame of reference moving with the slug front, a pair of vortices is identified at the slug front. Accordingly, a continuous increase in velocity is observed at lower sections of the pipe. From CPs data, the flow coefficient is estimated to be between 2.11 and 2.20 for the elongated bubble flow, and 2.26 and 2.38 for the slug flow in laminar conditions investigated. From PIV data, the flow coefficient is estimated to be between 2.28 and 2.34 for the elongated bubble, and 2.31 and 2.44 for the slug flow, respectively. These slight differences in the obtained values of flow coefficient indicate the possible misunderstands of 1.13 multiplier. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid accumulation in deviated gas wells is a major challenge in production systems. Limitations with the use of gas lift, pumping or plunger lift methods add to this challenge. Recently, surfactants have been injected continuously or as batch to help with the well deliquification by foam generation. The batch treatment is done by intermittent application of soap sticks or liquid surfactants. This study is an effort to characterize surfactant batch treatment as an artificial lift method in horizontal gas wells. Given the practical potential and yet limited number of studies on this topic, the results can provide an experimental source to optimize surfactant application in mature production systems. The experimental study is performed in a 2-in ID facility consisting of a 64-ft lateral section with 1° downward inclination followed by a 41-ft vertical section. Water and compressed air are the liquid and gas phases, and an anionic surfactant is applied in batches at the heel of the well. First, static tests are conducted to analyze surfactant efficiency in well start-up conditions. The surfactant concentration, initial liquid loading level and gas rate are varied, and the final liquid loading volume is measured as the target parameter. Then, dynamic tests are conducted to mimic the flowing well conditions. Surfactant concentration, liquid and gas flow rates are varied, and pressure fluctuations at the toe are monitored with time. The surfactant batch is delivered after air-water flow stabilization to investigate the surfactant efficiency. In addition, a high speed camera is used to record the flow conditions. For well startup conditions, surfactant batch treatment is most effective for lower gas flow rates. Furthermore, the efficacy of surfactants is more pronounced at lesser-loaded wells. The effect of increasing surfactant concentration is eminent below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) with no further improvement beyond CMC. Generally, surfactant batch treatment does not significantly improve well cleanup time. During well production, surfactant batch treatment is most efficient in low liquid and gas flow rate systems. At increased liquid and gas flow rates, with increasing surfactant concentration, its use can be inefficient due to adverse effects caused by foam frictional pressure losses. When the surfactant batch treatment is efficient, its effect increases with increasing concentration until CMC is reached. During severe slugging, surfactant batch treatment eliminates the slug production phase and partially or fully eradicates the severe slugging depending on the severity of the slugs. Generally, no significant trends can be observed between the period of effectiveness and concentration of surfactant. "

This experimental configuration allows the use of different liquids at stagnant conditions (water, water with flowing air and oil). The experimental results show that plunger fall velocity in water is about 4% of the plunger velocity in air. Under a bubbling column and for all plunger types, the fall velocity fluctuates as the air passes through the plunger yielding, in some cases, an average velocity similar to the water case. The fall velocities in low and medium viscosity oils are 60% and 42% of the average velocity in water, respectively. Second, a comprehensive experimental facility was designed and constructed to study the plunger under dynamic operating conditions (or cycles) and at different fluid pressures (air). When the plunger fall velocity was studied under a cyclic operating conditions, the resultant fall velocity is about 60% of the velocity observed in only air, but 30 times larger than the corresponding velocity in stagnant oil. Comparatively, the fastest conventional plunger is the spiral type, whereas the conventional sealing types (pad and brush) are the slowest ones. In addition, the effect of pressure is substantial and the fall velocity of the plunger rapidly decreases as the gas phase (air) pressure increases. Based on the experimental observations and data analysis, it was found that the fall velocity depends mainly on the type of plunger, air phase pressure, thickness of the liquid film on tubing wall, viscosity of the liquid, and density of the gas phase. Plunger lift is one of the most used deliquification method for gas wells. However, only a few experimental studies have been found in the literature. None of them attempt the comparison of different plungers. This study present a new set of data that helps to understand the behavior of the different types of plungers. "

                    "abstract": "Gas lift operations in toe-down gas wells are usually dictated by convenience or knowledge based on previous experience. Parameters such as end of tubing location and packer placement are vital in determining efficacy of gas lift operations, alongside injection rate and injection location. The aim of this study is to quantify the effects of these parameters. The scope of this study is to provide guidelines to help assist design of gas lift systems for toe down gas wells. A large scale experimental facility was constructed to study gas lift operations in toe-down gas wells. Air and water were used as test fluids, and the flow rates studied were those typically seen in toe down gas wells, resulting in slug flow being the dominant flow regime. Three end of tubing locations were studied, and in two of these locations the effect of a packer was quantified. Two different injection locations were studied as part of this study. Flow parameters such as pressure drop, holdup and slug characteristics were measured along the test facility. Experimental results indicated that gas lift operations do not significantly affect the behavior of flow parameters such as holdup and pressure, upstream of the point of injection. The most significant effect of gas lift is observed to be a reduction of pressure drop fluctuations downstream of the point of injection. Packer placement also significantly affects gas lift performance, and it was observed that packered configurations are more efficient. Also, for a given end of tubing location, gas lift injection at the deepest point is observed to be the most effective in reducing pressure drop fluctuations. This is the first experimental study conducted on the effect of end of tubing location and packer placement on gas lift operations on a large-scale test facility with field scale diameters for casing and tubing. Packer placement is currently dictated by mechanical concerns and depth limitations. This study addresses potential risks and benefits of running a packer as deep as possible, from a hydrodynamic standpoint. "

Inclination angle in the lateral section was varied ±1° from the horizontal to simulate three well configurations, namely, toe-down, one-undulation with a sump, and one-undulation with a hump. Slug length and frequency along the well were measured using fourteen conductivity probes located along the test section. Experimental results indicated that slug length in the vertical and lateral sections of a well present values up to four and two times, respectively, larger than typical dimensionless slug length reported in the literature. Furthermore, slug flow development along the vertical section is affected by the lateral section deviation angle and length. At the same time, lateral section slug flow development is affected by liquid fall back from the vertical section and lateral section length. Slug characterization along the well is critical to properly design and operate downhole and surface equipment and properly predict pressure gradient and liquid holdup along the well. "

                    "abstract": "Pseudo-slug (PS) and churn (CH) flows are among the least understood flow patterns for gas-liquid flow in pipes, despite their importance in many engineering applications. Owing to visual differences, they are commonly perceived as different flow patterns. This study presents characterizations of these flow patterns, which suggests their analogous behavior, thus enabling possibility of unified modeling between them. The experiments were conducted using an air-oil (0.213 Pa.s liquid viscosity) system with a 0.0508-m ID, 21.7-m long, upward inclined polycarbonate test section under atmospheric pressure. Flow patterns were identified using the dimensionless voltage time-trace readings of two-wire capacitance probes, supplemented by high-speed camera observations. The capacitance probes were used for slug/ pseudo-slug/ churn flow characterizations. Additionally, capillary-seal differential pressure transmitters for pressure drop measurement and quick-closing-valves section for liquid holdup measurement were used. Experimental results demonstrate that despite their visual differences, PS and CH share several common characteristics. First, both PS and CH exist between slug (SL) and segregated flows (annular or stratified) as superficial gas velocity (vSG) changes in the flow pattern map. Second, non-monotonic relationships between translational and mixture velocities are observed for both flow patterns in contrast to linear behavior for conventional SL flow. Third, both flow patterns exhibit similar signature of capacitance probes time-trace data and its distribution histogram. Fourth, they show similar values of drift-flux flow distribution coefficient (C0). And fifth, a consistent bias tendency is observed when conventional SL flow models are used to predict the pressure gradient of both flow patterns. The visual difference between PS and CH may be attributed to higher frequency, wavier film interface, and more uniform pipe wetting exhibited by CH compared to PS flow due to inclination angle effects. Several SL to CH transition models are modified/ extended to predict SL to PS transition. The combination of Taylor bubble flooding and a unified slug flow model is found to predict the SL to PS transition accurately within the experimental range, further supporting the analogy between PS and CH.

Therefore, accurate prediction of the critical gas velocity that can avoid the liquid accumulation is of great importance. An experimental study of onset of liquid-film reversal, which is believed to be the main cause of liquid accumulation, was conducted in a hilly-valley test section at low-liquid-loading condition. A new, easily implemented mechanistic model to predict critical gas velocity, which is specifically developed based on the liquid-film reversal in stratified flow, is proposed in this work. The new model was verified with the data acquired in the study and other studies from the open literature, showing a fair agreement. This work also reviewed and evaluated other critical-gas-velocity-prediction models. The new model performs best compared with other models, especially in terms of the inclination angle and liquid-flow-rate effect on critical gas velocity. The total average absolute error was reduced 6.0% compared with the current best-prediction model (Zhang et al. 2003), and 38.2% for the widely used Turner et al. (1969) droplet-removal model. "

The model evaluates the thin film thickness based on the Nusselt falling film theory coupled with a liquid mass balance in the cross sectional area of the pipe. This coupling relates the rate of deposited droplets at the thin film with the atomization and deposition at the bottom liquid film. The thin film thickness is used in an equation that corrects the gas-wall friction factor.

                    "abstract": "Pseudo-slug flow is widely encountered in petroleum production systems, such as in upward inclined pipelines and deviated wells with liquid loading issues. To author's knowledge, there is no model yet available to predict the behavior of this flow pattern. This study presents a simple model to predict the design parameters of pseudo-slug flow (pressure gradient and liquid holdup). The modeling approach relies on the fact that pseudo-slug structure involves a continuous gas passage despite of apparent intermittency as a whole. Consequently, pseudo-slug flow is treated as a segregated flow with very large waves rather than a conventional slug unit cell. A modeling approach combining drift-flux and two-fluid models is proposed in this study. This method eliminates the need to arbitrarily prescribe the interfacial friction factor correlations for pseudo-slug, which would conceivably differ from those of stratified/ wavy/ roll-waves flow reported in literature. A new closure relationship is needed for pseudo-slug flow drift-flux coefficients, which are easily derivable from experimental data in literature. Iterative procedure requirement to run the proposed model is minimal, which is an advantage for practical application. Additionally, this modeling approach does not produce multiple solutions, which may be exhibited by conventional two-fluid model. Pseudo-slug flow experimental data are collected from literature for benchmarking purpose. The accuracy of pressure gradient and holdup predictions of the proposed model is better than two state-of-the-art multiphase flow simulators, which generally treat pseudo-slug as slug flow. The values of interfacial friction factor naturally emerge in the calculation instead of being prescribed by a closure relationship. These calculated values exhibit sensible physical relations with pseudo-slug characteristics observed experimentally. The closure relationships for drift-flux coefficients remain to be improved in the future as more pseudo-slug experimental data become available. "

Current two-phase slug flow models and their closure relationships are based on experimental data with low viscosity liquids (μL < 20 mPa s). However, recent studies show that two-phase flow behavior of high viscosity liquids is significantly different than that of low viscosity liquids. The objective of this paper is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the effect of high oil viscosity on slug characteristics in upward gas-oil vertical pipe flow.

The experimental results were used to comparatively analyze the physical behavior of flow parameters and evaluate existing mechanistic models and closure relationships, where significant discrepancies are found in prediction of slug frequency and average slug length. Based on a dimensional analysis approach, a new empirical slug frequency closure relationship is developed for high viscosity liquid upward two-phase vertical flow. The new closure relationship is a function of both Froude and viscosity dimensionless numbers. A validation study of the proposed model showed significant improvement in slug frequency prediction for high viscosity when compared with existing slug frequency correlations. "

                    "abstract": "In slug flow modelling, the shear stress between the slug body and the pipe wall is one of the critical parameters to define the frictional pressure drop. Experiments were carried out in a 50.8-mm ID horizontal flow loop to identify the trend of the wall shear stress within the slug body for liquid viscosities of 0.51 Pa·s and 0.96 Pa·s. A new setup allowed accurate assignment of the signals from the Constant Temperature Anemometry (CTA) to the corresponding positions in the slug body. Experimental evidence shows that arrival of the slug fronts do not indicate an immediate increase in the wall shear stress at the bottom of the pipe. INTRODUCTION Slug flow is a commonly encountered gas/liquid two-phase flow pattern in pipelines. In slug flow modelling, the shear stress between the slug body and the pipe wall is one of the important parameters for the estimation of frictional pressure drop. In many of previous modelling studies such as Dukler and Hubbard (1), constant wall shear stress values are predicted, and applied to develop and validate models. A more adequate wall shear stress measurement is required to investigate the possible effect of wall shear stress changes within the slug body. Additionally, the observation contributes to the analysis of eddy length in the mixing region, Nicholson et al. (2). In production system design, it is crucial to predict the slug characteristics correctly based on fluid properties and operational conditions. In predicting flow features, viscosity appears as an intrinsic variable in almost all slug flow models. These models are developed for low viscosity fluids. However, two-phase slug flow can exhibit significantly different behaviour for higher viscosity oils as reported by Gokcal et al (3), (4), Kora et al. (5), Brito et al. (6) and Kim (7). "

                    "abstract": "Multiphase flow mechanistic models are macroscopic conservation equations (mass and momentum) supported by several empirical closure relations. There are several empirical corelationsavailable for each closure relationship. The success of mechanistic models largely depends on the employed closure relationships. Although, ideally, the closure relationships are desired to be applicable for all operating conditions and fluids;however, in reality, it is difficult to find such universal closures due to empiricism involved in the development of the closureships. Until the development of universal closure relationships, another viable approach is to find different set of closure relationships for identifiably different flow conditions such as low liquid loading flow or high viscosity liquids. In this study, we present a procedure to test the performance of multiple closure relationships against available databases. As an initial application of the procedure, we have tested different combination of closure relationships in the Unified Model (Zhang et al., 2003) and identified the combinations of closures that produce the best model performance for low liquid loading conditions using the field data set consisting of the nineteen field measurements from Frigg to St. Fergus gas and condensates export line. The results of the 37,620 simulations were analyzed. The results showed that the original set of closure relationships used in Zhang et al. (2003) was not optimal for this particular set of data. Instead, a different set of closure relationships is proposed to improve the model's performance for these specific field cases. Total absolute average pressure drop deviation was reduced form 11% to 10%. Total absolute average liquid content deviation was reduced from 66% to 1%. Using the proposed procedure, with the availability of additional large-scale field data, the set of closure relationships can be further refined, and even the elusive goal of finding universal closure laws would be possible.

The experimental data are analyzed and compared with the model predictions. Suggestions are made to improve the existing model. It is found that the operating pressure clearly affects pressure gradient. The effects of operating pressure on liquid holdup are insignificant for the investigated range.

Modification of the interfacial velocity in the interfacial shear stress term in TUFFP Unified Model v2015 is suggested to partially account for the effects of the operating pressure. The new model predictions are compared with the experimental data from this study and studies from other sources.

These flow patterns were analyzed and compared with slug dissipation in the downhill section of the undulating pipe section. When these flow patterns were compared with two-phase slug dissipation behavior, no water cut effect was observed.

However, the evolution of liquid slug length distributions for 20% and 80% water cuts in the upstream horizontal section and upward inclined section did not show any significant dependence on water cut. Furthermore, the modified in-house two-phase model predicted the slug flow evolution along the undulated pipeline with a reasonable accuracy.

Experiments were conducted in a facility with a 2-in. ID and 62.6-ft. long lateral section and a 41-ft. vertical section, which mimics a horizontal well. Four well configurations were considered; namely, toe-down, toe-up, one-undulation with a sump and one-undulation with a hump. Additionally, different flow conditions were used to simulate the well production as the reservoir pressure depletes. The effect of well trajectory on the liquid removal was evaluated measuring the pressure gradient, liquid holdup, film reversal, and flow pattern. Experimental results indicate that under stable conditions, toe-up is the best configuration for the displacement of the produced fluids from the toe to the kick-off point. However, at very low gas flow rates, severe slugging is observed in this configuration. Furthermore, for the toe-down, one-undulation with a sump, and one- undulation with a hump configurations liquid loading is observed in both lateral and vertical sections of the well. Consequently, significant liquid accumulation and an eventual slugging condition are observed in the well. It was observed that the measured critical gas velocity to avoid liquid loading is lower than gas velocity at the minimum pressure gradient, indicating that minimum pressure gradient criterion is not enough to determine whether the well will be under stable or unstable conditions. Finally, toe-down configuration presents the largest liquid accumulation in the lateral section, indicating lower efficiency to remove liquids from the toe to the kick-off point. "

Six different oil viscosities—586, 401, 287, 213, 162, and 127 mPa·s;—were considered. The superficial-liquid and -gas velocities were varied from 0.05 to 0.7 m/s and from 0.5 to 5 m/s, respectively. Flow pattern, pressure gradient, and average liquid holdup were measured and analyzed in this study. The experimental results were used to evaluate different flow-pattern maps, mechanistic models, and correlations for two-phase flow. Significant discrepancies between experimental and predicted results for pressure gradient were observed. "

                    "abstract": "The oil and gas production pipelines typically operate at high Reynolds number and low wall shear stress conditions. However, the current wax deposition prediction models were developed based on the laboratory flow loop experimental data obtained at high shear stress and low Reynolds number. It is required to have reliable experimental data, which closely resembles the field conditions to validate the existing models or fine tune the effect of scale up parameters with available laboratory data. Hydrodynamic parameters such as Reynolds number and shear stress would incorporate the effects of diameter, flow rate and viscosity collectively, thus enabling a comprehensive approach for modeling the phenomenon. However, it is necessary to understand the individual effects of Reynolds number and shear stress as they are coupled. In the present study, the effect of the hydrodynamic parameters is decoupled with specially designed flow loop experiments. The deposit thickness and wax content were measured, and the wax mass density (wax mass deposited per unit area) was calculated. Since the area of deposition is changing, the main variable analyzed in this study is the deposited wax mass density instead of the deposit thickness and wax content. From the results, it has been observed that the Reynolds number has a more dominant effect on the deposited wax mass density compared to shear stress. This behavior is observed for in house synthesized model oil and different crude oils at various experimental conditions. The results obtained in this study enhance our understanding on the deposition behavior at various hydrodynamic conditions and aids in scale up from the laboratory to field conditions. Moreover, in order to develop more accurate wax prediction models for operations particularly for waxy crude oil production lines, it is necessary to tune right scale up parameters for field applications.

The model predictions are compared to the experimental data of Karami et al. (2016a, b). These experiments were conducted with water or 51 wt% of MEG in the aqueous phase, and inlet aqueous phase fraction values from 0 to100%. Modeling of three-phase flow can be described as a combination of two-phase gas-liquid flow modeling, and a liquid phase oil-water mixing modeling. A mechanistic model is proposed to predict flow characteristics of three-phase stratified wavy flow in pipeline. For the gas-liquid interactions, Watson's (1989) combined momentum balance equation derivation was applied. However, the calculation procedure was reversed, and the wave celerity was assumed as an input, while interfacial friction factor was one of the model's outputs. The liquid-liquid interactions were modeled using a simple energy balance equation and shift in liquid phase center of gravity calculations. The liquid phases can be separated, partially mixed, or fully mixed. The bottom aqueous film velocity was calculated using the law of the wall formulation, and was used to calculate the flowing aqueous phase fraction. The model predictions of different flow characteristics for two and/or three-phase flows were compared with available experimental data. The pressure gradient, wave amplitude, and aqueous phase fraction predictions were in good agreement with the experimental data. However, the liquid holdup predictions were slightly under-predicted by the model. Overall, an acceptable agreement was observed for all cases. Most of the common multiphase stratified flow models are developed with the assumption of steady-state conditions and with constant interfacial friction factor value. This study proposes a novel method to model stratified flow. The predictions are in acceptable agreement with experimental data conducted under stratified wavy flow pattern conditions. "

                    "abstract": "The transport of solid particles in pipelines is of interest in the petroleum industry, and is needed to increase flow efficiency in the pipe and prevent pipeline damage due to the particles’ accumulation. To achieve this goal, the velocity of the carrier fluid in the pipe needs to exceed the threshold velocity. Many solids transport models are available for predicting the threshold velocity, but for the same input condition, the predictions of these models may vary by orders of magnitude, and information regarding the confidence of the models’ predictions is not readily available. To resolve these issues, this paper presents a model evaluation and uncertainty propagation approach that uses a novel combination of data clustering, model parameter fine-tuning, model screening and ranking, model uncertainty quantification, and Monte Carlo simulation methods. The inputs are the experimental database for solids transport, a set of solids transport models, and the input condition(s) where the models’ predictions are needed. The outputs of the methodology include the models’ rankings, and the envelopes of the models’ predictions to within a predetermined confidence level. By propagating the uncertainties of the models, experimental data, and input conditions, the highest-ranked models produce velocity envelopes at the 90% confidence level that cover the experimentally-observed values for 92% of the cases; while using the prediction of an individual model does not provide any information regarding the prediction confidence.

                    "abstract": "Most of the commonly used multiphase flow models neglect the amount of droplets entrained in stratified wavy flow. However, the experimental data presented in this study show high entrainment values, exceeding 50% in some cases. This shows that neglecting entrainment phenomenon can introduce a major source of discrepancy into multiphase flow modeling predictions. This study improves the entrainment fraction predictions in three-phase stratified flow. The droplet entrainment in three-phase stratified flow in horizontal pipelines is experimentally investigated using a 0.152-m ID facility. The experiments are conducted under low liquid loading conditions, which is very commonly observed in wet gas pipelines. The oil-aqueous-gas flow experiments are initially performed without mono-ethylene glycol (MEG), and then repeated with 50 wt% of MEG in the aqueous phase to analyze the effects of MEG presence on entrainment. MEG is a commonly used inhibitor in oil industry, applied to avoid hydrate formation in offshore systems. Its impacts on multiphase flow droplet entrainment are investigated. The experimental range of this study covers superficial gas velocity (vSg) values from 17 to 23 m/s, superficial liquid velocity (vSL) values of 0.01 and 0.02 m/s, and inlet liquid stream aqueous phase fraction (APFin) values between 0 to 100%. Similar test matrix is completed for both water and water and MEG solution as the aqueous phase. An isokinetic probe system is used to measure the entrained droplet flux at different vertical positions in the gas phase. Liquid entrainment fraction is then estimated by means of volumetric averaging. The trends of the data with respect to input parameters are investigated. The two and three-phase entrainment fraction data are used for a correlation evaluation study. Performances of ten correlations for two-phase entrainment fraction are compared to the experimental data, and best performing correlations are identified. The correlation of Pan and Hanratty (2002) is modified in an effort to improve the entrainment fraction estimations. The predictions of the modified correlation are compared with the acquired data and datasets from the literature. In addition, a simple empirical correlation is proposed to predict liquid phase entrainment fraction for three-phase flow systems. "

                    "abstract": "Paraffin or wax deposition under two-phase gas/oil slug flow in horizontal pipes is studied experimentally. The experiments are conducted by use of a 2.067-in., large-scale multiphase flow loop under an operating pressure of 350 psig. Testing fluids are Garden Banks condensate and natural gas. Two-phase-flow hydrodynamics and single-phase paraffin-deposition experiments are conducted and used as base cases for a comprehensive data analysis. Deposition experiments are conducted with parametric variation of oil and gas superficial velocities and testing durations of 4, 12, and 24 hours. The bulk fluid and initial pipe-wall temperatures at a removable spool piece are kept below wax-appearance temperature (WAT) and relatively constant to ensure consistent initial dissolved-wax-concentration differences and to avoid thermal restriction in the growth of the deposit. Unprecedented detailed measurement and analysis of the circumferential local samples are conducted by use of a newly designed pigging tool with high-temperature-gas-chromatography (HTGC) and differential-scanning-calorimetry (DCS) deposit-characterization techniques. The results reveal that deposit thickness decreases with the increase in the superficial liquid velocity (vSL) for all two-phase-flow cases. The crossover trends of the thickness vs. time are suggested by the single-phase deposition data to occur at times less than 6 hours. Circumferential analysis shows that, for the slug-flow wax deposit, the deposit at the top wall is thicker (by a factor of approximately 1.9), softer, and contains more oil than the bottom deposit. The final overall deposit wax contents are found to increase with the superficial gas velocity (vSG) for the case of vSL = 1 ft/sec, but nonmonotonic change occurs for the case of vSL = 3 ft/sec. Wax deposits under slug flow have longer chain n-alkane compared with single-phase flow having the same wax-fraction cases. Wax mass at the top wall is greater (by a factor of approximately 1.7) than the bottom mass. This new set of complete experimental data serves as the fundamental understanding of single-phase and two-phase gas/oil slug-flow paraffin deposition. "

This study consolidates several single-phase wax deposition data acquired in recent years and validates several wax deposition models for a comprehensive range of experimental conditions. The film mass transfer (FMT), equilibrium (EM), Matzain (1999), and Venkatesan (2004) models were tested against 70 experimental data points (19 sets of initial operating conditions), obtained with four different oils and flow loop facilities. Uncertainty propagation analysis was performed to estimate reasonable ranges of error in the prediction that may be caused by fluid properties or standard correlations instead of the model formulation itself. The FMT model regularly over-predicts the deposition rate, which is consistent with previous theoretical, experimental, and visualization studies. It is observed that EM does not necessarily serves as the lower bound of deposition rate, suggesting that some form of flux reduction effects may exist. Sherwood number analysis was performed to validate conclusions from FMT and EM model assessment. A fix set of shear coefficient values in Venketasan's model is not sufficient to achieve acceptable accuracy in general, indicating that the shear coefficients are likely to be oil and flow conditions dependent. Matzain's model delivers relatively superior performance on deposit wax mass and flux predictions among the four models, although it is still unable to predict aging mechanistically and the deposition trends as a whole. In conclusion, more mechanistically rigorous wax deposition models and experimental data are still needed. "

The effect of parameters such as pressure and flow development length on slug frequencies were studied and comparisons with model predictions were made. The available slug frequency models have all been developed for smaller diameter pipes. Comparison of model predictions for 6 in. ID pipe with the experimental results has shown that none of the existing slug frequency models could predict the experimental results with even moderate accuracy. The empirical nature of the current slug models is the main reason for their poor performance. This study also shows significant gaps in the existing slug frequency models/correlations, namely: Introduction Slug flow is a very common flow pattern in pipelines and wellbores. It is characterized by an alternating liquid slug and gas bubble configuration. Slug frequency models are used as input parameters in several mechanistic slug flow models, such as Dukler and Hubbard (1975), Taitel and Barnea (1990), Sylvester (1987), Felizola and Shoham (1995), etc . Thus, the use of an accurate slug frequency model can potentially result in better pressure gradient predictions by the aforementioned slug flow models. Prediction of slug frequency is also important from a materials standpoint, as slugging can significantly increase erosion, corrosion, and fatigue in pipelines. In the following section, an overview of the slug frequency models reviewed in this study is presented. "

                    "abstract": "Foam lift is one of the most cost effective methodologies for unloading gas wells. The surfactants are either injected intermittently or continuously to lift the liquid to the surface. By reducing the gravitational gradient and increasing the frictional gradient, the critical velocity at which liquid loading occurs is shifted to lower gas velocities. Currently, we do not have a methodology to predict the critical velocity (at the transition boundary of annular and intermittent flow) and the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. To address this, we measured several foam flow characteristics in both small scale and large scale facilities. Small scale facility involved measurement of foam carryover capacity as a function of time and surfactant concentration. Large scale facility involved measurement of liquid holdup, pressure drop, fraction of gas trapped in foam and foam holdup in 40-ft 2-in. and 4-in. tubing. We developed closure relationships for liquid hold up, foam holdup, fraction of gas trapped in the foam and interfacial friction factor by combining the small scale data with the data collected in the large scale experiments. These closure relationships are applicable to four different surfactants tested. A new transition criterion was developed and successfully used to predict onset of liquid loading under foam flow. Using a force balance over the gas core in annular flow, we developed a new procedure to calculate the pressure drop under foam flow conditions. We compared our model results with actual measurements in the large scale facility. Our model was reasonably able to predict the pressure drop within ±30%. The reason for such a large variance is that the small scale facility was not able to capture all the characteristics of the foam which were observed in the large scale facility. It is very difficult to reproduce the foam characteristics exactly in two different experiments. This is discussed further in this paper. The procedure developed is the only one currently available to calculate the pressure drop under the foam flow conditions using the small scale data. It is superior to conventional annular flow pressure drop prediction models which are currently available in the literature. "

This paper presents a unified gas/oil/water heat transfer model for pipe flow at inclinations from -90° to +90°. It provides a new approach to three-phase pipe flow mechanistic heat transfer modeling. In this approach, three-phase hydrodynamic parameters were calculated first using Zhang and Sarica (2006) unified model. Then, the heat transfer models were developed for gas/oil/water three-phase flow patterns. The phase distributions were described as gas/liquid flow pattern and oil/water mixing status. Energy balance, temperature differences and variations were analyzed for each case. Overall heat transfer coefficients were derived and programmed. To test the program implementation, a synthetic field case was created and run. The temperature prediction was reasonably compared with commercial steady-state and dynamic multiphase flow simulators. The gas/oil/water heat transfer model was then compared with an oil/gas two-phase experimental data from Manabe (2001) for different flow patterns in a 52.5-mm inner diameter pipe from horizontal to upward-vertical inclinations. Overall performance of the present model was good. Convective heat transfer coefficient prediction was within 22% absolute average relative error. Mixture temperature was predicted within 1.5% absolute average relative error. After comparing with two-phase flow data, sensitivity of heat transfer coefficient to water cut was analyzed by changing the water cut from 0.0 to 1.0 under different flow conditions. Predicted convective heat transfer coefficient was sensitive to flow pattern, water cut and flow rate changes. Generally, the predicted convective heat transfer coefficient increases as water cut increases for the same flow pattern. "

The optimum EOT location methodology without artificial lift is validated with 2-in. flow loop data and applied to synthetic field-scale cases. This methodology postulates the minimum ?ptotal, defined as the difference between toe and wellhead pressure, should determine the optimum EOT location. The methodology is extended to incorporate reservoir coupling and liquid loading analysis to produce a more comprehensive EOT analysis. Liquid loading evaluation is necessary as the optimum EOT methodology may not indicate the liquid loading potential in the well. In the case where reservoir potential is integrated into the methodology, maximizing the well's gas flow rates is used as the optimization criterion. The modification of the methodology to determine the optimum EOT location with installed gas lift or Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) system is demonstrated. Gas lift can be used to reduce the ?ptotal or increase the in-situ gas velocity to avoid liquid loading. In ESP systems, EOT location plays a role in preventing gas lock from occurring in the ESP by utilizing the natural separation of liquid and gas at an appropriate EOT location. "

In this paper, we extend the Kriging method to propagate the uncertainties from multiple sources, and for cases where the distribution of the prediction is produced at each trial (replication) of the simulation-based uncertainty propagation approach (i.e., at each sample point). The outputs of the methodology are the approximate percentiles of the output distribution. The capability of the methodology is tested using a Case Study involving the transport of solid particles in pipelines to prevent solid particle deposition and improve pipeline efficiency. Statistical comparisons suggest that our methodology successfully replicates the outputs from the Monte Carlo simulation method with a 94% reduction in computational cost. "

                    "abstract": "An experimental study investigating the effects of end of tubing (EOT) on the two-phase gas-liquid flow behavior in horizontal wells was performed. The experimental data were used to develop methodologies to determine the optimum EOT location for the observed flow types: stable and cyclic flows. Total pressure drop, liquid inventory and the two-phase flow hydrodynamic behavior were analyzed to determine the optimum EOT location criteria. Tubingless completion and four packerless EOT locations were tested using a transparent laboratory-scale flow loop facility resembling two horizontal well configurations: toe-up and toe-down with 1-in. tubing and 2-in. casing. Water and compressed air were used as test fluids with various constant flow rates under low pressure. Minimum total pressure drop in the well was used to determine the optimum EOT location for stable flow. Various total pressure drop vs. EOT location relationships were observed under different operating conditions. Under low gas flowrates, installing tubing may promote severe slugging (SS) for a toe-up system. EOT located at kick-off point may be preferred as it showed the least test number of points with SS behavior. In addition, this location generated the lowest liquid holdup in the tubing and backpressure to the lateral section in most cases. The observations to explain these findings and the comparison of the tested EOT locations in handling SS were discussed. "

                    "abstract": "Most gas wells produce some amount of liquid. The liquid is either condensate or water. At high rates, the gas is able to entrain liquid to the surface; however, as gas well depletes, the liquid drops back in a gas well (called liquid loading) creating a back pressure on the reservoir formation. Addition of surfactants to the well to remove liquid is one of the common methods used in gas wells. Liquid loading in vertical gas wells with and without surfactant application was investigated in this study. Anionic, two types of amphoteric (amphoteric I and amphoteric II), sulphonate and cationic surfactants were tested in 2-inch and 4-inch 40-feet vertical pipes. Pressure gradient and liquid holdup are measured. Visual observation with a high speed camera was used to gain insight into the direction of foam flow in intermittent flow and foam film flow under annular flow conditions. Liquid loading is initiated when the liquid film attached to the wall in annular flow starts flowing downwards. Introduction of foam causes the gas velocity at which film reversal occurs to decrease; this shift increases with increasing surfactant concentration and it is more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. That is, the benefit of surfactants is much more pronounced in 2-inch pipe than in 4-inch pipe. The reason for postponement of liquid loading is reduction in the liquid holdup at low gas velocities which reduces the liquid holdup in foam flow compared to air-water flow. However, at higher gas velocities, the pressure drop in 2-inch compared to 4-inch pipe increases rapidly as the surfactant concentration increases. The selection of optimum concentration of the surfactant is a balance between the reductions in the gas velocity at which liquid loading occurs compared to increase in the frictional loss as the concentration increases. We provide guidelines about the selection of the surfactant concentration. Visual observations using high speed camera show differences in the behavior under foam flow conditions. Unlike air-water flow, the liquid film attached to the wall is replaced by thick foam capturing the gas bubbles. The type of roll waves which carry the liquid in 2-inch pipe is different than what was observed in 4-inch pipe. Compared to 4-inch pipe, the roll waves in 2-inch pipe are much thicker. This partly explains the differences in 2-inch versus 4-inch pipe behavior. "

                    "abstract": "The present study describes the wall shear stress and the falling liquid film behavior in upward vertical slug flow of air and high viscosity oil. The frictional pressure gradient is directly related to the wall shear stress, and it is usually negative (opposite to the overall flow direction). However, in vertical slug flow, the average total wall shear stress of a slug unit may be negative (in the same direction of the overall flow), resulting in a positive frictional pressure gradient. However, this does not mean, by any way, generation of additional energy or violation of the second law of thermodynamics. The positive frictional pressure gradient phenomenon, reasons and required conditions were explained in this paper. A simplified model was developed and validated against recent experimental data of air-high viscosity oil slug flow in a 50.8 mm ID vertical pipe. The oil viscosity was in the range of 127 mPa s to 580 mPa s. Positive frictional pressure gradient appears when the liquid film wall shear stress supersede the wall shear stress in the slug body. The rate of increase of both wall shear stresses (with respect to the mixture Reynolds number) depend, not only, on the mixture Reynolds number but also, highly, on the liquid viscosity. "

The PI selection process is challenging as their working mechanisms are yet to be fully understood. The understanding of crude specific interactions and the upscaling capability from cold finger testing in laboratory to full field scale is limited. This work emphasizes a microscopic study of paraffin crystals morphology under the influence of polymer based chemical inhibitors. The experiments were performed with three types of PI (A, B, and C), two types of oil (a model oil with 1%-wt. wax and a condensate with 9%-wt. wax), and three different PI concentrations (100, 250, and 500 ppm) For no PI cases, the crystal size between the condensate (CS) and the model oil (MO) are visibly different as MO produces bigger crystals with less nuclei number density than CS. The PI-A (linear co-polymer) is observed to promote formation of larger crystals in both oils, except for 250 and 500 ppm concentrations in CS. The PI-B (long chain comb-like co-polymer) and PI-C (short chain comb-like co-polymer) are observed to generate smaller crystals in both oils, most of the times with greater nuclei number density. The PI-B is more effective in reducing crystal size for CS while PI-C is more effective in MO. An increase in PI concentration does not necessarily magnify the changes in crystal size exhibited in lower concentration. The microscopic characteristics (e.g., crystal size, nuclei number density) of paraffin crystals are expected to affect macroscopic characteristics (thickness and hardness) of the deposit. "

Several models have been developed that predict such velocity. However, none of these models provide information regarding the confidence of these predictions.

A unique contribution of this paper is the use of the bootstrap method to quantify the uncertainty of the model's prediction. This information is used to compute the envelope of the threshold velocity predictions to within a predetermined confidence level. We compared the performance of our semi-mechanistic model to existing models using statistical analysis and parity plots. The comparison suggests that our semi-mechanistic model is accurate, and is capable of explaining the variation in the experimental data. The threshold velocity envelopes suggested by our model cover the experimentally-observed values for 92%, 90%, and 93% of the experimental data for hydraulic transport from a bed of solids, pneumatic transport from a bed of solids, and pneumatic transport from the bottom of the conduit, respectively.

The experiments are conducted under low-liquid-loading condition, which is very commonly observed in wet-gas pipelines. The analyzed flow characteristics include wave pattern, liquid holdup, water holdup, pressure gradient, and wetted-wall fraction. The experimental range covers superficial-gas-velocity (vSg) values of 8 to 23 m/s, superficial-liquid-velocity (vSL) values of 1 to 2 cm/s, and inlet-liquid-stream water-cut values of 0 to 100%. Differential-pressure transmitters, a quick-closing valve and pigging system, and a high-speed camera are used to acquire the data. The trends of the data with respect to input parameters are investigated. The performances of commonly used models are compared with liquid-holdup, pressure-gradient, and water-holdup experimental results. The observed wave patterns include stratified smooth and stratified wavy with 2D waves, 3D waves, roll waves, and atomization flow. The transitions between the flow patterns vary as a function of water cut. The trends of pressure gradient, liquid holdup, and water holdup with respect to vSg, vSL, and water cut are observed, and interpretations on the basis of physics are provided. The predictions of a transient multiphase-simulation software; the Tulsa University Fluid Flow Projects (TUFFP) unified model (Zhang et al. 2003), version 2012; Beggs and Brill (1973); Taitel and Dukler (1976); and Xiao et al.

                    "abstract": "The uncertainty in the holdup measurements of a capacitance based WMS with 32×32 wires has been experimentally evaluated, and a methodology for its quantification is proposed for horizontal flow. Investigation is performed in laboratory and in-situ experiments under stagnant conditions with an emphasis on the effect of the mesh grid orientation on the measurements. Also, potential impact of misalignment in the pipe inclination is explored by slightly inclining the pipe for both tests. Finally, dynamic flow conditions are tested in a high pressure (1.37 MPa) facility with horizontal stratified-wavy oil/air two-phase flow for gas and liquid superficial velocity ranges of 2.8 m/s≤νSg≤6.9 m/s and 0.01 m/s≤vSL≤0.05 m/s, respectively. The angle between the phase interface and the sensor wires is ineffective while the misalignment in the pipe inclination plays a major role in the deviations of the holdup measurements. Using the proposed methodology, the measurement uncertainty from laboratory tests is shown to follow a logarithmic increase as a function of the measured holdup for smaller holdup values (HL≤15%) and to be lower than 1.5% for HL>15%. This behavior is intrinsic to WMS and a representative of the measurement uncertainty in the actual flow loop installation. Under actual flow conditions, the holdup measurements of the trapped liquid by WMS show an offset compared to the measurements via flow imaging which can be corrected by using the uncertainty quantified in the laboratory tests. However, the dynamic measurements with WMS show a good agreement with the holdup of the trapped liquid volume within the quantified uncertainty bounds. "

They have been extensively applied to a wide range of two-phase gas–liquid flow problems with conducting and non-conducting liquids. However, for very low liquid loadings, the state of the art data analysis algorithms for WMS data suffer from the comparably low spatial resolution of measurements and from boundary effects, caused by e.g. flange rings – especially in the case of capacitance type WMS. In the recent past, diverse studies have been performed on two-phase liquid–gas stratified flow with low liquid loading conditions in horizontal pipes at the University of Tulsa. These tests cover oil–air flow in a 6-inch ID pipe and water–air flow in a 3-inch ID pipe employing dual WMS with 32×32 and 16×16 wires, respectively. For oil–air flow experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.2 m/s≤νSG≤15 m/s and 0.01 m/s≤νSL≤0.02 m/s, respectively [2]. In water–air experiments, the superficial liquid and gas velocities vary between 9.1 m/s≤νSG≤33.5 m/s and 0.03 m/s≤νSL≤0.2 m/s, respectively [17], [18]. In order to understand the stratified wavy structure of the flow, the reconstruction of the liquid–gas interface is essential. Due to the relatively low spatial resolution in the WMS measurements of approximately 5 mm, the liquid–gas interface recognition has always an unknown uncertainty level. In this work, a novel algorithm for refined liquid–gas interface reconstruction is introduced for flow conditions where entrainment is negligible. "

Experiments were conducted for the low-liquid loading horizontal flow in large diameter pipe indicative of wet gas transportation pipelines. The flow loop consisted of 0.015 m (6 in.) diameter and 56 m long horizontal pipe. A backlit high speed visualization system was developed to capture images of the entrained drops. The images were processed and analyzed to determine drop size distribution. Images were captured at three different locations along vertical axis of the pipe, and distribution of the entrained liquid drops at each location was analyzed. The changes in size distribution and average size of drops along the vertical axis were studied at different gas flow rates. Upper limit log normal (ULLN) distribution and log normal distribution were used to fit experimentally determined size distribution. Stratification of drops was observed and average drop size was found to decrease from bottom to top of the pipe. The spatial variation tended to decrease with increase in gas velocity. Experimentally determined drop sizes were greater than those predicted by available correlations for Sauter mean diameter (SMD), volume median diameter and maximum diameter. The error tended to increase from bottom to top of the pipe. The discrepancy could be because most of the available correlations are empirical based on data for air-water flow, which is a high-surface tension system, and commonly for vertical annular flow. Accurate estimation of size of entrained drops is necessary for prediction of their concentration distribution across the pipe cross-section and fraction of liquid entrained in the gas phase. This is required for prediction of pressure gradient and liquid holdup and evaluating flow assurance risks in condensate pipelines. "

Air and water were used as fluids. The surfactant used was a foaming agent capable of forming stable foams in all brines for a wide range of pH values. Pressure behavior in the flowline/riser system was monitored, and input-gas-, injection-gas-, liquid-, and surfactant-flow rates were measured continuously. In addition, visual observations were made to identify severe slugging. Effects of the proposed method were quantified with a modified elimination performance index (MEPI) that considered not only pressure fluctuations, but also backpressure effects. Thirty tests were conducted. The data were analyzed for the severe-slugging suppression of the combination of surfactant and gas lift, the effect of gas lift on surfactant injection, and the effect of the surfactant on the reduction of the gas lift gas. The combination technique with the highest gas lift rate completely eliminated the severe slugging for all tests conducted. Surfactants were able to suppress severe slugging for most of the cases. The performance of the \"only-surfactant injection case\" increases as the gas/liquid ratio increases. For all of the tests, backpressure reduction was observed. The MEPI is used as the main parameter to assess the performance of the severe-slugging-suppression methods. Gas lift not only contributes to density reduction through volumetric increase of gas in the riser, but it also reduces the mixture density by promoting more foam generation. There were reductions in the gas lift rate from the original maximum gas lift injection rate for all the tests conducted with surfactant injection. "

The liquid holdup, liquid film height, wetted wall perimeter decrease with the increasing superficial gas velocity. The interfacial surface area is calculated from the distinct interface between the phases from the experimental data without any assumptions on the interface geometry. The variation of the interfacial surface area is found to be closely related to the liquid holdup. The region where the interface fluctuations spread in the pipe cross-section is analyzed. For low gas flow rates, a small region exists where the fluctuations are negligible implying a continuous liquid contact with the pipe bottom. However, an increase in the superficial gas velocity extends the spatial reach of the interface fluctuations very close to the pipe wall at the bottom where the continuous liquid region diminishes. For all experimental conditions examined, the interface fluctuations occurring at a frequency range of 10 Hz < f < 40 Hz is hypothesized to be related to the capillary waves. At low superficial gas velocities, the roll wave topology is stretched toward the sides of the pipe. Moreover, the oscillations of these waves at different transverse locations are out-of-phase.

Hydrodynamic experiments were performed prior to the wax deposition experiments to verify the flow patterns and examine the flow behavior. The hydrodynamic and heat-transfer variables were estimated using the unified mechanistic model (Zhang et al., 2003). Wax deposition experiments were conducted under single-phase and slug flows with parametric variation of oil and gas superficial velocities and testing durations of 4, 12, and 24 hrs. The bulk fluid and initial pipe wall temperatures at a removable spool piece were kept below WAT and relatively constant to control the initial concentration driving force.

A new pigging tool was designed and constructed for selective wax sampling at top, side, and bottom quarters of the circumference of the removable spool piece. Local deposit thicknesses were calculated from the direct measurements of deposit mass and density. Wax samples were analyzed by using DSC and HTGC for wax content and composition. The impact of the physics of the slug flow on wax deposition was investigated. The results indicated that deposit thickness, wax content, and wax mass were affected by the change in superficial velocities or the flow rates of the phases. It was found that the deposit thickness increased with time. The thickness decreased with increasing superficial liquid velocity; whereas, it increased with increasing superficial gas velocity. The trends of the thickness were found to crossover each other at a certain time for different superficial gas velocities. In slug flow, circumferential variations of the deposit characteristics were analyzed. The deposit at the top wall was thicker, softer, and contained more oil than the bottom. Wax fraction increased with time reflecting the aging. Moreover, wax fraction increased with higher superficial liquid and gas velocities at a given time. The crossover of the wax fraction trends with different superficial gas velocities occurred. In slug flow, deposit at the top wall always had lower wax fraction than the bottom. Average carbon number and WAT of the deposit relatively increased with wax fraction. Wax deposits under slug flow had longer chain paraffins compared to the single-phase flow with the same wax fraction. Wax mass at the top wall was higher than the bottom. This new set of experimental data can be used as a verification tool for further development of wax deposition mechanistic model under such conditions. "

                    "abstract": "During a shutdown of crude oil production from offshore fields, the trapped fluid inside the riser and flowlines starts cooling down, triggering the precipitation of the dissolved wax particles when the temperature drops below the Wax Appearance Temperature (WAT) of the mixture. This work aims to study the settling tendencies of precipitated wax under quiescent conditions when the final temperature of the crude oil is below its WAT but above or near its pour point. An experimental test facility was designed and constructed to simulate subsea cooling of crude oils under quiescent conditions. A series of experiments were carried out with different model oils and wax concentrations to study gravity settling. Moreover, modifications were made to an existing hindered particle settling model and its application to wax settling scenarios was assessed by comparing the results obtained thereof with the results obtained experimentally. The results obtained from the experimental runs show that gravity settling can be appreciable under certain operating conditions and fluid properties. It was observed that waxy model oils which have pour point (PP) temperatures above the surrounding ambient temperature tend to form gels as the fluid temperature decreases below the PP during the quiescent conditions. However, in cases where the pour point is close to or below the surrounding ambient temperature, precipitated wax particles may have a tendency to settle under gravity instead of gelling up. The results also portray the effect of wax concentration on the settling behavior. Understanding the behavior of precipitated wax particles in quiescent conditions under the influence of gravity in different systems of varying wax concentrations can help in identifying and remediating operational difficulties associated with wax precipitation during shutdown. The effect of gravity on wax particles in vertical pipelines during shutdown has not previously been studied much and the settling phenomenon in such situations is not well-known. Due to the effects of changing temperature, particle shape and other factors, gravity settling of wax particles in such systems is different from other systems where a particle is settling in a fluid under gravity. This work provides some input on certain key aspects of this phenomenon. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading is the inability of a riser or gas well to produce liquids, resulting in reduction of gas production in mature gas fields. Mechanisms describing liquid loading initiation are not well understood for inclined pipes or deviated wells. Knowing the effect of pipe inclination over the liquid-loading initiation will help for the development of a predictive tool for flow assurance, well production forecast as well as remediation techniques enhancing gas production. An experimental study of low liquid loading has been conducted for 90°, 75°, 60° and 45° inclined pipes. Air/water flow in a 3-in ID pipe has been investigated. Pressure gradient and average liquid holdup were measured. Visual observations with high and low speed cameras have been recorded to identify flow patterns and liquid film behavior for each test point. Pipe inclination effects on critical gas velocity for flow pattern transition have been investigated. The critical gas velocity represents the maximum gas flow rate where the liquid loading is observed. This critical velocity increases as pipe inclination deviates from vertical. Pressure gradient fluctuations and liquid film flow behavior are closely related with liquid loading initiation. As the pipe deviates from vertical and owing to the increasing liquid film thickness at the bottom of the pipe, slug and churn flow patterns are promoted. Therefore, the existing critical velocity prediction models, which ignore the circumferential variation of film thickness, produce significantly different values of critical velocities when compared with the experimental data. Liquid loading is one of the main problems that the industry faces during the production of natural gas wells and transportation of low liquid loading gas-liquid flow through a riser. This study serves as a foundation for future model developments to avoid and remedy liquid loading related problems in risers and gas wells. "

Flow-rate stabilization is essential for profitable operation of these wells. Moreover, the use of nozzles can help make in-situ foam treatments more efficient. The combined use of venturi nozzles and foamers is proposed as a novel artificial lift method. The effect of downhole venturi nozzles on flow stabilization of gas wells has been experimentally investigated. Air-water flow was studied in a 2? vertical pipe. The effect of the nozzles on in-situ foam generation was also studied. Using the principles of Nodal Analysis, it was observed that the use of downhole venturi nozzles significantly improved the stability of production. The nozzles induce back-pressure on the flow inlet. The smaller the throat diameter is, the greater the back-pressure is. Therefore, proper sizing of the nozzle is important. Flow through the nozzles was characterized using CFD simulations and a sizing methodology has been proposed. Foam flow was studied for injection before and after the nozzle at very low concentrations of a commercial foamer. The presence of the nozzle during foam flow did not affect the pressure gradient or holdup characteristics significantly when compared to foam flow without nozzle. However, the foam stability and quality were affected by the nozzle, depending upon the position where the foamer was injected (either before or after the nozzle). "

                    "abstract": "Slug liquid holdup is one of the most important parameters of slug flow. It is closely related to the average liquid holdup and pressure gradient of slug flow in wells and pipelines. The mechanistic models of Barnea and Brauner (1985) and of Zhang et al. (2003a) are based on the turbulent liquid-slug assumption for low-viscosity oils. However, for high-viscosity oil, the liquid slug is laminar because of the low slug Reynolds number. In this study, a mechanistic slug-liquid-holdup model is developed for low- and high-oil-viscosity slug flows. The model is based on two shear mixings: shear mixing between the slug front and pipe wall and shear mixing between the slug body and liquid film. The model uses slug-flow characteristics that can be calculated by solving the continuity and momentum equations of slug flow. A data bank consisting of 418 slug-liquid-holdup measurements that were obtained from various authors is used to analyze and validate the model. In the data bank, liquid viscosity ranges from 0.0016 to 0.589 Pa·s (1.6 to 589 cp). Pipe-inclination angle ranges from –30° to upward vertical. Pipe inside diameter varies from 5.08 to 10 cm. Statistical evaluations are conducted and compared with predictions of other models, and significant improvement is observed in the performance of the new model. "

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading, which can lead to rapid gas-rate decline and can even cease gas production, is a common phenomenon found in most mature gas wells. An accurate prediction of the inception of liquid loading is of great interest to operators, for the reason that remedial measures can be applied in a timely manner to prevent such conditions from being realized, thereby extending the production life of a gas well. However, the mechanism that is responsible for liquid loading still remains controversial. In the literature, at least three different definitions of liquid loading exist. The first definition is based on the intersection of inflow and outflow curves, the second definition is based on the reversal of entrained liquid droplets, and the third definition is based on the reversal of liquid film. These definitions yield different results when predicting the inception of liquid loading. In this paper, a new definition of liquid loading is introduced. This new definition is based on the relative contributions of gravity and residual pressure drop, and it is validated by its agreement with air/water experimental data. A new comprehensive model is developed that is based on the Barnea (1986, 1987) model. For vertical wells, the new model can better predict the inception of liquid loading than the widely used Turner et al. (1969) equation. For deviated wells, it is observed in the field and in laboratories that liquid loading starts much earlier than in vertical wells, and most liquid-loading equations are not appropriate for deviated wells. The new model takes into account the nonuniform film thickness around the circumferential position of the pipe, and, thus, it improves the prediction of liquid loading in deviated wells. The new model is validated through the use of field data in the literature and experimental data obtained at the University of Tulsa. In addition to the literature data, a new set of field data is reported and used to validate the new model, which shows a significant improvement over the droplet model as well as other film models.

                    "abstract": "Sand is often produced with oil and gas even though sand control practices are used. To successfully transport solids in pipelines, the fluid velocity must exceed the critical velocity. Solids transport models are used to predict this velocity. However, for the same input field or laboratory condition, the models’ critical velocity predictions may differ by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, none of the models provide information regarding the confidence in their velocity predictions. This paper introduces a systematic methodology, which selects the appropriate solids transport models for predicting the operational critical velocity envelope to ensure solids transport in the pipe to within a predetermined confidence level. Given a field or laboratory condition as input, the approach generates: (1) velocity predictions and uncertainty bounds of all models to within a predetermined confidence level, (2) recommendation of appropriate models for calculating the critical velocity at the input condition, and (3) impact of the uncertainty of input condition, experimental data, and model on the overall uncertainty bounds. The methodology uses data clustering, model evaluation, optimization, and uncertainty propagation approaches. Based on three Case Studies, the velocity envelopes suggested by the methodology, at the 90% confidence level, are consistent with experimental observations. For input laboratory conditions, which are used for validation purposes, the contributions of model, input condition, and experimental data uncertainties to the velocity prediction uncertainty were between 50 – 90%, 3 – 20%, and 6 – 40%, respectively. If the parameters of the selected models were fine-tuned, for the same input conditions, the above uncertainties contribute about 40 – 90%, 4 – 15%, and 1 – 50%, respectively, to the velocity prediction uncertainty. For an input field condition (the fourth Case Study), the above values become about 35 – 70%, 7 – 25%, and 25 – 45%, respectively; and about 25 – 30%, 30 – 32%, and 40 – 42%, respectively, if the parameters of the models are fine-tuned prior to uncertainty estimation. The results of these Case Studies suggest that for laboratory conditions, most of the uncertainty in a model’s critical velocity prediction comes from the model, while for field conditions, the uncertainties of the model, input condition, and data may have nearly equal contributions. Introduction Sand is often produced with oil and gas even though sand control practices, such as gravel packs, are used (Danielson, 2007). Solid particles may also be purposely introduced to enhance production through proppant hydraulic fracturing (Pujiastuti et al., 2010), or for natural gas dehydration using solid dessicants (e.g., alumina, silica gel, molecular sieves) (Manning and Thompson, 1991). When present in pipelines, these particles need to be transported by the carrier fluid to prevent the deposition and accumulation of solids, which can lead to partial blockage of the pipe. The accumulation may result in increase in pressure drop and required pumping pressure (Danielson, 2007; Oudeman, 1993), decrease in flow area which increases risk of erosion damage (Ponagandla, 2008), and prevention of corrosion-inhibiting chemicals from making contact with the entire pipeline (Almutahar, 2006; Danielson, 2007; Delavan, 2012; Oudeman, 1993; Ponagandla, 2008).

The severity of riser slugging typically becomes worse with increasing riser height and may be especially problematic for some aging deep-water production systems. Severe riser slugging is characterized by large fluctuations of liquid (oil and water) and gas production arriving at the topsides first stage separator. The severe slugging cycle is divided in four steps as described in Figure 1. The classic pipe geometry for severe slugging is a slightly downward section upstream of a riser. In step 1, gas and liquid velocities are low enough to allow stratified flow in the downward sloping pipe section followed by liquid bridging and accumulation at the bottom of the riser. The hydrostatic pressure of the accumulated liquid initially increases equal to or faster than the build-up of gas pressure upstream of the liquid plug (Step 2). When the gas pressure eventually exceeds the hydrostatic head of the liquid slug, the gas will begin to push the liquid plug out of the riser and start to penetrate the riser (Step 3). The pressure in the gas reduces as the liquid is removed from the riser and the gas expands increasing the velocities in the riser. After most of the liquid and gas exits the riser, the velocity of the gas is no longer high enough to sweep the liquid upwards. Liquid film not swept from the riser starts falling back down the riser (Step 4) and the accumulation of liquid starts again. "

As expected, condensate addition did alleviate the challenge of both wax deposition and waxy oil gel restart of the commingled pipeline. Pipeline operating data including pigging frequency, transient flow rate and pressure drop were analyzed to estimate average wax deposit growth rates for the condensate line and the commingled line for various blends of oil and condensate liquids. Flow rate, pressure drop, inlet and arrival temperatures, and seabed temperature data were used to validate thermo-hydraulics of the system. A numerical scheme was developed to eliminate noise in the data and calculate deposition rates between two consecutive pig runs for condensate and commingled pipelines for various blends of the condensate and oil. Detailed laboratory analysis of fluids was performed for their wax deposition potentials (including high temperature gas chromatographic, wax appearance temperature, wax content, density and viscosity). Wax characteristics have been used in an in-house Wax Deposition simulator to predict the wax deposition rate under various operating conditions. For the condensate liquid, wax deposit surface roughness was found to significantly contribute to the pressure drop increases, and therefore, increase in the measured pressure drop cannot be solely attributed to deposit thickness increase. For the commingled fluid system, the simulator predictions using the Film Mass Transfer Model (FMTM) with aging reasonably matched the deposit thickness obtained from the field data. For the condensate liquid system, both FMTM and Equilibrium Model (EM) were assessed and it was confirmed that the predictions from the two models bound the wax deposition rate calculated from the field data.

Currently, an arbitrary roughness value for the deposit roughness, typically the pipe roughness value, or reference measured pressure gradient is used in deposit thickness calculation models. During the process of wax deposition the topology of the deposit surface is expected to change. Therefore, the assumption of a constant pipe roughness for the deposit interface can result in inaccurate deposit thickness estimation.

South Pelto crude oil was used for the deposition test. The tests with water cuts of 0, 16, and 35% were conducted. The general observation from the turbulent flow tests is that the deposit near the test fluid inlet side exhibited a patchwork pattern and the deposit sloughing occurred due to undeveloped flow. However, under the fully-developed flow conditions the deposit surface was found to be visually smooth in most cases. Specifically, the deposit surface of (1) the single-phase fully-developed flow cases where 3300 = Reini = 4300 and (2) the fully-developed flow region in all 16% water cut cases was found to be visually smooth. The deposit surface for laminar emulsion flow with 35% water cut displayed many stream-like grooves. "

The proposed methodology consists of: (1) a data clustering approach that selects the data points from the experimental database that best represent the specified operating condition; (2) a model parameter fine-tuning module that adjusts the parameters of the models using the selected data to increase the models’ accuracy within the range of the operating condition; and (3) a model ranking approach that uses statistical analyses to determine the appropriate models for the operating condition. This methodology is validated using 164 experimental data points for horizontal (or near-horizontal), solid/liquid flow at low particle concentrations as operating conditions. The methodology generates underestimates of the threshold velocity for 38% of the above-mentioned operating conditions, compared to 45% for the Mantz (1977) model and 52% for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model; and produces velocity predictions exceeding±50% of the experimental velocity for only 10% of the operating conditions, compared to 27% for the Mantz (1977) model and 35% for the Oroskar and Turian (1980) model. The proposed methodology improves the accuracy of threshold velocity predictions compared to using conventional models. Initiating the motion of solid particles from the bottom of horizontal pipelines at low particle concentrations has been a topic of interest due to the desire to prevent the accumulation of solid particles in pipes. In order to initiate the movement of the particles, the magnitude of the velocity of the single-phase fluid must be equal to at least that of the threshold velocity for particle motion. There are multiple models that predict the threshold velocity, but for the same operating condition, the velocity estimations of these models might differ by orders of magnitude. Therefore, at a given operating condition, it is necessary to determine the models that best predict the threshold velocity. The methodology proposed in this paper successfully identifies the most accurate models to use at a given operating condition. "

                    "abstract": "The recent trend of increasing energy demand led the industry toward the development of heavy oil unconventional resources. However, the production and transportation of such heavy oil is a challenge because of the lack of understanding of two-phase flow behavior under the condition of high-viscosity liquid phase. The objective of this study is to physically understand the effect of liquid viscosity on slug length and develop an empirical two-phase slug-length correlation for high oil viscosity. The developed sluglength correlation can improve the existing two-phase flow models often used in the development and maintenance of heavy-oil fields. Experimental high-viscosity (0.181-0.589 Pa.s) two-phase air/mineral viscous oil slug-length data is acquired in a horizontal 0.0508-m ID pipe. High-speed recorded flow visualization revealed the effect of liquid-phase viscosity on the scooping and shedding processes at the slug front and back, respectively, and liquid film thickness in the Taylor bubble zone. Data analysis showed a one-third reduction in high viscosity (0.181-0.589 Pa.s) average slug length compared with low viscosity (0.001-0.017 Pa.s) average slug length. Furthermore, analysis of slug-length distributions revealed that as liquid viscosity increases, slug-length distribution deviates from the log-normal distribution to a trancated positively skewed distribution. As a result, the average, the variance, and maximum slug length values vary with liquid viscosity. On the basis of these experimental observations, a physical model is proposed which suggests that the thick liquid film in the Taylor bubble zone and the short slug-mixing zone at the slug front result in a fully developed velocity profile at the slug back, stabilizing the slug at a shorter length. A new dimensional-analysis-based empirical model is proposed to predict dimensionless average slug length for high-viscosity liquid slug flow. A validation and comparison study of the proposed correlation showed the best performance among the existing correlations. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a systematic methodology of quantifying the fluid velocity needed to transport solid particles in a conduit for a given field operating condition. The methodology uses data clustering and model parameter fine-tuning approaches, statistical analysis, and an uncertainty propagation method. Publicly-available experimental data on solids transport and solids transport models were gathered through an extensive literature review. The data clustering algorithm selects the representative experimental data points that lie closest to the operating condition. Then, the parameters of the solids transport models are fine-tuned using unconstrained optimization with the representative experimental data. The fine-tuned models are compared using statistical analysis to identify the ones that provide the most accurate velocity predictions for the operating condition. The uncertainties in the experimental data are incorporated into the methodology using the Monte Carlo simulation method to quantify the bounds of the models' velocity predictions to within a predetermined confidence level. To demonstrate the performance of the methodology, the solids transport velocity predictions and their bounds are quantified for an experimental datum point, removed from the database, used as an operating condition. When the uncertainties in the experimental data are ignored, the velocity predictions of the higher-ranked models fall to within the same order of magnitude. And when the uncertainties of the experimental data are incorporated into the methodology, the mean velocity predictions produced by the higher-ranked models not only fall to within the same order of magnitude, but they are nearly equal to each other, which means that these velocity predictions can be accepted with higher confidence. In addition, the mean velocity predictions and the 97.5th percentile velocity predictions are nearly equal to each other, which means that these velocity predictions can be accepted at the 95% confidence level. It was found that for the case study, the solids transport velocity predictions produced by the proposed methodology are sufficient to transport the solid particles in the pipe, and these velocity predictions fall to within +30% of the experimental velocity. Introduction To prevent the accumulation of solid particles in pipelines, the velocity of the fluid in the pipe needs to exceed the critical velocity (i.e., the minimum fluid velocity required for transporting the solid particles).1,2 To predict the critical velocity, solids transport models are used. However, many solids transport models have been developed over the years, and these models can produce velocity predictions that vary by orders of magnitude for the same operating condition.3 Moreover, these models only report single values for the critical velocity prediction. Thus, in using a model's velocity prediction, there will be questions regarding whether or not operating at such velocity is sufficient to transport the solid particles. Therefore, it is important that one identifies the appropriate models for a given operating condition, and quantify the uncertainties in the models' velocity predictions to ensure a safe and efficient operation. A methodology was developed by Soepyan et al.3 to identify the appropriate models for a given operating condition. The methodology consists of a data clustering component, a model parameter fine-tuning module, and a model ranking protocol. The data clustering component selects the experimental data from the database that are most similar to the operating condition, which would best represent the operating condition. The model parameter fine-tuning module uses the selected experimental data to adjust the parameters of the models in order for the models to produce the most accurate velocity predictions possible for the selected data. The model ranking protocol uses statistical analysis to determine the models that provide the most accurate velocity predictions for the operating condition. For a given operating condition, the methodology was capable of generating velocity predictions that fall to within the same order of magnitude. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Slug liquid holdup is one of the most important parameters of slug flow. It is closely related to the average liquid holdup and pressure gradient of slug flow in wells and pipelines. Barnea and Brauner (1985) and Zhang et al. (2003a) mechanistic models are based on the turbulent nature of liquid slugs, which is typical for low viscosity oils. However, for high viscosity oil slug flow, the liquid slug is laminar due to low slug Reynolds number. In this study, a slug liquid holdup mechanistic model is developed for low and high viscosity oil slug flows. The model is based on two shear mixings including shear between the slug front and pipe wall, and shear between the slug body and liquid film. The equations are solved based on slug flow characteristics which can be calculated by solving the continuity and momentum equations of slug flow. A data bank consisting of 418 slug liquid holdup measurements is used to validate the model. In the data bank, liquid viscosity ranges from 0.0016 to 0.589 Pa·s (1.6 to 589 cP). Pipe inclination angle is from -30? to upward vertical. Pipe inner diameter (ID) varies from 5.08 to 10 cm. Statistical evaluations are also conducted against predictions of other models. Significant improvement is observed in the performance of the new model. Introduction Heavy oil constitutes a major portion of the world's total oil reserve. It is discovered and produced around the world and has become one of the most important future hydrocarbon resources with ever increasing world energy demand and depletion of conventional oils. However, heavy oil possesses very high viscosity which poses many challenges for its production and transportation. Accurate pressure gradient and liquid holdup predictions of high-viscosity oil multiphase pipe flows are imperative for heavy oil production and transportation. Most of the current multiphase flow experimental studies, correlation and model developments were conducted using low-viscosity conventional oils or other liquids. However, high-viscosity oil multiphase flow behaves very differently than low-viscosity oil multiphase flow. Significant discrepancies were observed in model comparisons. Slug flow is a dominant flow pattern in high-viscosity oil/gas pipe flow. In two-phase slug flow, liquid slugs and gas pockets propagate alternatively in the pipe. Liquid slugs without gas entrainment are rare under normal pipeline operating conditions. Instead, gas bubbles are often entrained in the liquid slugs. The liquid volume fraction in the slug body is known as the slug liquid holdup. The slugs can carry different amount of entrained gas, which primarily depends on flow rates, fluid properties, and pipe diameter. A slug unit consists of the slug body and a liquid film zone. The fast moving aerated slug body over rides the slow moving liquid film ahead of it. The slug scoops the liquid film and accelerates it to the velocity of the slug (mixture velocity). Liquid is shed from the tail of the slug to a trailing film. Slug liquid holdup is an important parameter for slug flow modeling. Most of the pressure drop in slug flow occurs in the slug body. The frictional pressure drop is greater in the slug body than in the film region. The liquid film acceleration also causes significant pressure drop in the mixing zone at the slug front. Thus the overall pressure gradient depends greatly on the slug liquid holdup and slug length. "

When the comparison is carried out in terms of mass flow rates, critical flow rate for liquid loading in 2-in pipe is smaller than that in 4-in. pipe. This supports the use of velocity strings to extend the production life of the gas well. Additionally, comparison of the data with available mechanistic models prediction shows significant discrepancies. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are presented. "

                    "abstract": "The entrainment of sand in crude oil occurs during production from reservoirs with low formation strength. The stationary sand bed at the pipe bottom can cause operational problems such as production decline, excessive pressure loss, equipment failure, erosion and corrosion. Sand deposition can be managed by operating above critical sand deposition velocity, which is the velocity that keeps particles moving all the time at the pipe bottom. A comprehensive analysis of sand flow regimes in stratified flow in horizontal pipeline is presented here, which is a novel contribution in this paper. Also, the effect of concentration on the sand flow regimes and identification of critical sand deposition velocities for various concentrations are investigated in this paper. The understanding of sand flow regimes in pipelines for any given set of operational conditions is important to identify the nature of particle interaction and movement. Experimental studies have been conducted at stratified flow regime with air-water-glass bead at relatively low sand concentrations (<10,000 ppm). The effects of different experimental conditions such as gas velocity, sand concentration, and particle size have been investigated in this study. Six main sand flow regimes in horizontal air-water flow are identified, which can be distinguished visually: fully dispersed solid flow, dilute solids at wall, concentrated solids at wall, moving dunes, stationary dunes and stationary bed. Therefore, the critical sand deposition velocities are determined based on the transition between moving (concentrated solids at wall/ moving dunes, as appropriate) and stationary (stationary dunes/bed, as appropriate) sand particles. The experimental data shows that with small particle size, the critical sand deposition velocity is almost independent of concentration, while with bigger particle sizes, the critical velocity increases with the concentration.

                    "abstract": "Transport of sand in multiphase pipelines occurs in the petroleum industry as sand is produced co-mingled with crude oil. Stationary sand beds are formed at the pipe bottom when the flow velocity is lower than the critical sand deposition velocity. These sand beds reduce reservoir production and affect the integrity of the pipe system due to pipeline plugging and erosion/corrosion produced by sand particles. Therefore, the production system must be designed to operate at a velocity where sand particles are transported along the pipe. For that reason, it is crucial to predict the critical sand deposition velocity in order to maximize reservoir production. Gas-liquid-sand flow hydrodynamics, which is commonly encountered in most reservoirs and also in oil and gas transportation pipelines, is more complex than liquid-sand flow, making the modeling extremely difficult. At present, gas-liquid-sand flow is still not well understood, with limited data available in the literature. In addition, the effect of sand concentration has not been thoroughly studied for two-phase flows transporting sand. Experimental and theoretical investigations have been conducted in this study on gas-liquid-sand stratified flow in horizontal pipes at low sand concentrations. A 4-in experimental facility was designed and constructed and data were acquired utilizing air-water-glass beads flow. The data include measurements of critical sand deposition velocities, namely, the transition between moving and stationary beds. The data reveal that for a constant superficial liquid velocity, the critical mixture and liquid sand deposition velocities increase with increasing sand concentrations. Also, for a given sand concentration, the critical liquid velocity is almost the same for different superficial liquid velocities. The sand deposition correlations of Oroskar and Turian (1980) for single-phase flow and Salama (2000) for two-phase flow are modified and extended in order to develop a new correlation. The developed correlation enables the prediction of critical sand deposition mixture velocity for horizontal stratified flow, as function of sand concentration along with other parameters. Comparison between the predictions of the developed correlation and the experimental data reveal a very good agreement, whereby the relative errors of mixture and liquid critical sand deposition velocities are ±2.5% and < 5%, respectively.

The experimental data for tested conditions show that for concentrations above 4000 ppm, stationary beds are observed at the pipe bottom, and bigger particle size has higher critical sand deposition velocities, while for concentrations less than 4000 ppm, stationary dune and stationary bed are observed, and the critical sand deposition velocity depends on which sand flow regime occurs at the pipe bottom.

                    "abstract": "The entrainment of solid particles in crude oil occurs during production from reservoirs with low formation strength. The stationary solid-particles bed at the horizontal pipe bottom can cause operational problems such as production decline, excessive pressure loss, equipment failure, erosion, and corrosion. Solid-particles deposition can be managed by operating above the critical solid-particles-deposition velocity, which is the velocity that maintains the continuous movement of particles at the pipe bottom. Here, a comprehensive analysis of solid-particle flow regimes in stratified flow in a horizontal pipeline is presented, which is a novel contribution because it is applied to multiphase flow. The effect of concentration on the solid-particle flow regimes and identification of the critical solid-particles-deposition velocities for various particle concentrations are also investigated. The understanding of solid-particle flow regimes in pipelines for any given set of operational conditions is important for identifying the nature of particle interaction and movement. Experimental studies are conducted in a 4-in. horizontal pipeline for a stratified flow regime that uses air, water, and glass beads at relatively low solid-particles concentrations (<10,000 ppm). The effects of different experimental conditions, such as gas velocity, solid-particles concentration, and particle size, are investigated in this study. Six main solid-particles flow regimes in horizontal air/water flow are identified, and can be distinguished visually: fully dispersed solid flow, dilute solids at wall, concentrated solids at wall, moving dunes, stationary dunes, and stationary bed. Therefore, the critical solid-particles-deposition velocities are determined on the basis of the transition between moving (concentrated solids at wall/moving dunes, as appropriate) and stationary (stationary dunes/bed, as appropriate) solid particles. The experimental data show that with small particle size, the critical solid-particles-deposition velocity is almost independent of concentration, while with larger particle sizes, the critical velocity increases with the concentration.

A 4-in. experimental facility was designed and constructed, and data were acquired using air/water/glass-bead flow. The data include measurements of critical sand-deposition velocities—namely, the transition between moving and stationary beds. The data reveal that for a constant superficial liquid velocity, the critical sand-deposition mixture and liquid velocities increase with increasing sand concentrations. Moreover, for a given sand concentration, the critical liquid velocity is nearly the same for different superficial liquid velocities. The sand-deposition correlations of Oroskar and Turian (1980) for single-phase flow and Salama (2000) for two-phase flow were modified and extended to develop a new correlation. The developed correlation enables the prediction of critical sand-deposition mixture velocity for horizontal stratified flow as a function of sand concentration, along with other parameters. Comparison between the predictions of the developed correlation and experimental data from the literature (Angelsen et al. 1989; Najmi et al. 2015) reveals a good agreement, especially for a pipe diameter of 0.1 m.

                    "abstract": "Hydrocyclones have been used for many years for removing solids from continuous liquid media in the mineral, chemical, petroleum, and environmental industries, among others. In oilfield applications, the solid/liquid hydrocyclone (SLHC) has emerged as a sound technological and economical alternative to conventional filtration systems where space, efficiency, reliability, and continuous operations are critical. The SLHC is particularly attractive in offshore, subsea water-injection applications and in other oilfield operations. Early and effective removal of solids in pipelines and process equipment help prevent erosion and premature failures that are costly and pose serious health, safety, or environmental hazards. To date, hydrocyclone design has relied primarily on empirical experience and, most recently, costly and lengthy computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. The main objective of this work is the development of a mechanistic model for practical, yet reliable, SLHC design. The proposed model is capable of describing the hydrodynamic-flow phenomena inside the hydrocyclone, enabling the prediction of continuous-phase-swirl intensity and the velocity profile used in determining particle trajectories, and hence, the grade separation efficiency curves. The model is validated against oilfield experimental data run under a wide range of conditions and equipment configurations. Model agreement with Global and Grade separation efficiency data are 94.7% and 88.2%, respectively. "

                    "title": "Multiphase Flow Splitting in Parallel/Looped Pipelines",
                    "abstract": "Abstract A novel and unique experimental facility was design, constructed and instrumented, enabling slug flow splitting data acquisition in both parallel and looped lines. A total of 81 experimental test runs were carried out for various superficial gas and liquid velocity combinations. Uneven split conditions data were acquired by utilizing either a choke valve on one of the lines or different pipe diameters. For the symmetrical configurations of both parallel and looped equal diameter lines, the phases split equally in the lines. When the parallel and looped lines are of different resistance to flow (utilizing a choke installed on one of the lines or different line diameters), uneven split of the phases occurs. The gas-phase flows preferentially into the smaller resistance line. This results in different gas-liquid ratios in the two lines, which are different from the gas-liquid ratio at the inlet. A mechanistic model has been developed for the prediction of the uneven gas and liquid splitting and the pressure drop in two-phase looped lines. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, with an average error of about 15% in the phase splitting and pressure drop.  Introduction The Petroleum Industry utilizes parallel and looped pipelines in order to decrease pressure drop and increase flow capacity. However, the looped pipeline system design has been carried out in the past based on rule of thumbs. For single-phase flow, the splitting of the flow and the corresponding pressure drop can be determined in a straight forward manner, based on first principles.  However, the two-phase flow case is more complicated and no fundamental understanding of the splitting flow phenomena. This is the main reason for the lack of publications and studies in this area. Following is a brief summary of studies published on the parallel pipeline configurations.  Several studies were published on multiphase flow splitting in impacting tees. These include Hwang et al. (1989), Hong and Griston (1995), Azzopardi et al. (1988) and El-Shaboury et al. (2007). Chien and Rubel (1992) studied flow splitting behavior in steam flood distribution networks. Taitel et al. (2003) investigated the splitting of gas-liquid two phases in 4 parallel pipelines with common inlet and outlet manifolds, capable of rotating between 0-15 degrees. They found out that for the horizontal case, the split is more or less even between all the pipes. However, unor inclined flow, at low gas and liquid rates, the two-phase mixture prefers to flow into a single line, while stagnant liquid fills part of the other pipes. In a follow-up paper Taitel et al. (2006) presented a rigorous stability analysis for the determination of the flow splitting in the lines, capable of predicting the number of pipes that are filled with stagnant-liquid.  No studies have been published for two-phase flow splitting in looped lines, as operated by the Petroleum Industry. This is owing to the difficulty of measuring simultaneously the gas and liquid flow rates in each of the looped lines. This is the gap that the current study attempt to address. "

The main goal of this study is to predict the critical sand deposition velocity under stratified flow. The critical sand deposition velocity is defined as the minimum velocity that keeps all particles moving at all time, above which there is no stationary bed at all. Two models with similar approaches are developed based on the forces acting on a particle, such as the drag, turbulent, apparent gravity, van der Waals and lift forces for prediction of the transitions between moving/stationary dunes and moving/stationary bed. Dune pilling up and collapsing mechanism considering a torque balance on a rolling particle located at the top of the dune is adopted for stationary dunes. Torque balance applied to a rolling particle located on the lowest stratum of the moving bed layer is used to predict the minimum liquid film velocity for particle to grow a stationary bed. Comparison between the predictions of the two mechanistic models and the experimental data show good agreement, with critical sand deposition velocity absolute relative errors at 16.4% for stationary dunes and 12.6% for stationary bed.

This paper will provide a unique insight into these velocity profiles, which are critical for frictional pressure drop calculations and prediction of phenomena such as wall effects of multiphase flow, erosion, corrosion, hydrate formation, wax deposition, etc. The objective of this paper is the analysis of this gas-liquid flow pattern in a horizontal pipe utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and comparison of the results with experimental data. The scope also includes the investigation of turbulent flow structure beneath gas-liquid interface by calculating the stream-wise velocity profile. Experimental studies have been conducted to investigate gas-liquid stratified flow in horizontal pipe. A unique experimental facility was constructed with a 4-in ID PVC pipe and measurements were performed utilizing air-water. Liquid level at the center of the pipe is measured by ultrasonic proximity sensor at different superficial velocities of gas and liquid. Along with experimental tests, CFD simulations for the same test conditions have been performed using a commercial CFD code. For tracking the two-phase interface, Volume of Fluid (VOF) method was applied. The numerical simulation was obtained with the Realizable k-epsilon model of turbulence. Comparing the CFD simulation results and liquid hold up measured experimentally revealed a good agreement (discrepancy<±15%). The experimental data also show that at constant superficial liquid velocities, the liquid level increases with decreasing superficial gas velocities. The validation of the CFD results with experimental data indicates that, CFD simulation has the potential to be used for facility design and scale-up processes in petroleum industry. "

New acquired experimental data and modified Taitel and Dukler model (1976) with new closure relationship for interfacial friction factor appropriately demonstrate the effect of varying these parameters on liquid holdup. In this study, the data are acquired from two distinct experimental facilities, including the well flow loop of the Institute for Energiteknik (IFE) as well as multiphase flow loop at Tulsa University Technology Separation (TUSTP). Both loops are constructed from pipes with a 0.097 m ID, where the loop lengths are different. Utilization of the two loops is resulted a collection of experimental data, where water (0.001 Pa·s and 0.005 Pa·s PAC) and mineral oil (0.033 and 0.12 Pa·s) are used as liquid phase, and air and SF6 (ρ = 24 kg/m3) are used as the gas phase. Values of the gas and liquid velocities are selected to ensure that stratified flow occurs along the pipe. The acquired experimental data on the liquid holdup reveal that the liquid holdup increases with decreasing the superficial gas velocity at constant superficial liquid velocity. Also the data show that the liquid holdup reduces with decrease in the liquid viscosity and increase in the gas density. Taitel and Dukler (1976) model with different definitions for interfacial friction factors are compared with experimental data. The comparisons confirm that none of the closure relationships are appropriate for prediction of liquid holdup under a wide range of the experimental conditions.

The objective of this paper is to provide new data on droplet sizes under different shear conditions in oil-water flow and compare it with model predictions. New experimental data on droplet size distribution are acquired for a gear pump with an in-line camera, utilizing the bead sizing tool. The acquired data capture the effects of the dispersed phase volumetric fraction and shear intensity. Two prediction models for a centrifugal pump, namely, Pereyra (2011) model and Kouba (2014) model, are modified to enable droplet size distribution predictions for a gear pump. These models use the log-normal distribution and Rosin Rammler distribution methods, which have been found to match the acquired data very well. The results demonstrate that droplets tend to decrease in diameter when the shear intensity increases. Moreover, the higher the dispersed phase volumetric fraction is, the larger the resulting droplets will be. The modified prediction model of maximum droplet size (dmax) is valid for dispersed phase volumetric fractions up to 15%. Comparisons between the acquired data and the proposed droplet size distribution prediction, which utilizes the modified dmax model, is very good with Normalized-Root-Mean-Square Deviation (NRMSD) between 4% and 6%.

They can be installed alone as a flow splitter or combined in series to form a manifold. Application of looped lines is not unique to the petroleum industry; they are also applied in other industries such as nuclear and chemical. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive fundamental investigation of the flow behavior or predictive methods available for such systems because of the complexity involved with respect to process variables such as flow patterns, fluid properties, phase velocities, and pipe geometry. Uneven splitting of the gas and liquid phases between the two looped lines can cause malfunction of the downstream processing equipment; therefore, a total of 65 experiments at different flow conditions in a looped-lines system using different-diameter looped-line configurations are conducted in this study to investigate the pressure drop during uneven flow splitting. Most of the experiments are carried out with slug flow at the system inlet, while flow patterns such as slug flow, dispersed flow, and stratified flow are observed in the looped pipes. A computational algorithm is developed for predicting gas/liquid two-phase-flow splitting in the looped lines on the basis of energy minimization. The algorithm predicts the uneven splitting of the two phases and the corresponding pressure drop across the loop. Additionally, the model shows that maximum pressure drop occurs when there is equal splitting in the looped lines. Good agreements have been achieved between the measured and predicted flow splitting and pressure drop across the looped lines. "

                    "abstract": "The discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) approaches based on conforming grids become popular for modeling fractured reservoirs in the last decade. However, the application of conforming DFMs at field scale is limited due to its prohibitive computational cost. In recent years, embedded discrete fracture model (EDFM) has received considerable attention as a promising alternative. EDFM incorporates the effect of each fracture explicitly without requiring the simulation grid to conform to the fracture geometry. A compromise between accuracy and efficiency could be achieved in EDFM by enabling the use of standard corner-point grids for the background matrix domain. Although many works confirm the high accuracy of EDFM for the solutions of pressure and velocity field, very few results have been presented to examine its accuracy for the saturation solutions from multiphase flow problems. This paper shows that EDFM can induce large errors for multiphase displacement processes, due to its incapability to capture the proper flux split through a fracture. For the first time in the literature we present a systematic evaluation on the performances of EDFM for multiphase flow and provide a detailed analysis to illuminate when and why the method fails. The analysis motivates us to exploit the projection-based extension of EDFM (pEDFM) as an effective method to resolve the limitations associated with EDFM. pEDFM is recently developed by Tene et al. (2017) to address the issue of flow barriers, and is based on the introduction of extended fracture-matrix fluxes. Moreover, we make several improvements upon the original pEDFM method. A physical constraint on the preprocessing stage is proposed to overcome the limitation in a ‘naive implementation’ of pEDFM. A number of test cases with different fracture geometries are presented to benchmark the performances of the improved pEDFM method for multiphase flow. Grid convergence studies are conducted for different numerical schemes. The results show that improved pEDFM significantly outperforms the original EDFM method. "

The PPU numerical flux is non-differentiable across the co-current/counter-current flow regimes. This may lead to cycles or divergence in the Newton iterations. Recently proposed methods address improved smoothness of the numerical flux. The objective of this work is to devise and analyze an alternative numerical flux scheme called C1-PPU that, in addition to improving smoothness with respect to saturations and phase potentials, also improves the level of scalar nonlinearity and accuracy. C1-PPU involves a novel use of the flux limiter concept from the context of high-resolution methods, and allows a smooth variation between the co-current/counter-current flow regimes. The scheme is general and applies to fully coupled flow and transport formulations with an arbitrary number of phases. We analyze the consistency property of the C1-PPU scheme, and derive saturation and pressure estimates, which are used to prove the solution existence. Several numerical examples for two- and three-phase flows in heterogeneous and multi-dimensional reservoirs are presented. The proposed scheme is compared to the conventional PPU and the recently proposed Hybrid Upwinding schemes. We investigate three properties of these numerical fluxes: smoothness, nonlinearity, and accuracy. The results indicate that in addition to smoothness, nonlinearity may also be critical for convergence behavior and thus needs to be considered in the design of an efficient numerical flux scheme. Moreover, the numerical examples show that the C1-PPU scheme exhibits superior convergence properties for large time steps compared to the other alternatives. "

                    "abstract": "Implicit-reservoir-simulation models offer improved robustness compared with semi-implicit or explicit alternatives. The implicit treatment gives rise to a large nonlinear algebraic system of equations that must be solved at each timestep. Newton-like iterative methods are often used to solve these nonlinear systems. At each nonlinear iteration, large and sparse linear systems must be solved to obtain the Newton update vector. It is observed that these computed Newton updates are often sparse, even though the sum of the Newton updates over a converged iteration may not be. Sparsity in the Newton update suggests the presence of a spatially localized propagation of corrections along the nonlinear iteration sequence. Substantial computational savings may be realized by restricting the linear-solution process to obtain only the nonzero update elements. This requires an a priori identification of the set of nonzero update elements. To preserve the convergence behavior of the original Newton-like process, it is necessary to avoid missing any nonzero element in the identification procedure. This ensures that the localized and full linear computations result in the same solution. As a first step toward the development of such a localization method for general fully implicit simulation, the focus is on sequential implicit methods for general two-phase flow. Theoretically conservative, a priori estimates of the anticipated Newton-update sparsity pattern are derived. The key to the derivation of these estimates is in forming and solving simplified forms of infinite-dimensional Newton iteration for the semidiscrete residual equations. Upon projection onto the discrete mesh, the analytical estimates produce a conservative indication on the update’s sparsity pattern. The algorithm is applied to several large-scale computational examples, and more than a 10-fold reduction in simulation time is attained. The results of the localized and full simulations are identical, as is the nonlinear convergence behavior. "

We present a fully-implicit cell-centered finite-volume (CCFV) framework that can achieve second-order spatial accuracy on smooth solutions, while at the same time maintain robustness and nonlinear convergence performance. A novel multislope MUSCL method is proposed to construct the required values at edge centroids in a straightforward and effective way by taking advantage of the triangular mesh geometry. In contrast to the monoslope methods in which a unique limited gradient is used, the multislope concept constructs specific scalar slopes for the interpolations on each edge of a given element. Through the edge centroids, the numerical diffusion caused by mesh skewness is reduced, and optimal second order accuracy can be achieved. Moreover, an improved smooth flux-limiter is introduced to ensure monotonicity on non-uniform meshes. The flux-limiter provides high accuracy without degrading nonlinear convergence performance. The CCFV framework is adapted to accommodate a lower-dimensional discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) model. Several numerical tests with discrete fractured system are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the numerical model. "

Several alternative nonequilibrium/dynamic constitutive relations have been proposed in the literature including the works of Barenblatt, and Hassanizadeh and Gray. This work applies a Bayesian model selection framework in order to examine the relative efficacy of these three models to represent experimental observations. Experimental observations of multiphase displacement processes in natural porous media are often sparse and indirect, leading to considerable uncertainty in control conditions. Data from three core-scale drainage experiments are considered. Gaussian prior probability models are assumed for key multiphase flow parameters and measurements. Accurate numerical simulation approximations using the three constitutive relation models are implemented. The model selection analysis comprises a data-assimilation stage that calibrates the assumed model to the data while quantifying uncertainty. The second stage is the computation of the maximum likelihood estimate and its application to compute the Bayesian Information Criterion. It is observed that Barenblatt’s nonequilibrium model is more likely to match data from unstable displacements that involve higher viscosity ratios of the invading phase to the resident fluid. At the lowest viscosity ratio, there is no delineation between the goodness of fit obtained using the classical model and the model proposed by Hassanizadeh and Gray, and both outperform Barenblatt’s nonequilibrium model.

We develop, implement and demonstrate a mathematically sound adaptive framework to predict this sparsity pattern before the system is solved. The development first mathematically relates the Newton update in functional space to that of the discrete system. Next, the Newton update formula in functional space is homogenized and solved in such a way that it results in conservative estimates of the numerical Newton update. The cost of evaluating the estimates is linear in the number of nonzero components. The estimates are used to label the components of the solution vector that will be nonzero, and the corresponding submatrix is solved. The computed result is guaranteed to be identical to the one obtained by solving the entire system. When applied to various simulations of three-phase flow recovery processes in the SPE 10 geological model, the observed reduction in computational effort ranges between four to tenfold depending on the level of total compressibility in the system, the time step size and on the degree of complexity in the underlying physics. We show the extensions to the case of flow and multicomponent transport where the reduction in computation effort ranges between four to tenfold.

The objective of this work is to devise and analyze an alternative numerical flux scheme called C1-PPU that, in addition to improving smoothness with respect to saturations and phase potentials, also improves the level of scalar nonlinearity and accuracy. C1-PPU involves a novel use of the flux limiter concept from the context of high-resolution methods, and allows a smooth variation between the co-current/counter-current flow regimes. The scheme is general and applies to fully coupled flow and transport formulations with an arbitrary number of phases. Several complex heterogeneous multi-dimensional numerical examples under the three-phase black-oil formulation are presented. The examples include a miscible gas injection problem that involves significant variations in the total-velocity field over time. The proposed scheme is compared to the conventional PPU and the recently proposed Hybrid Upwinding schemes. We investigate three properties of these numerical fluxes: smoothness, nonlinearity, and accuracy. The results indicate that in addition to smoothness, nonlinearity may also be critical for convergence behavior and thus needs to be considered in the design of an efficient numerical flux scheme. Moreover, the numerical examples show that our C1-PPU scheme is both entropy-satisfying, and exhibits superior convergence properties for large time steps compared to the other alternatives. "

                    "abstract": "This work develops the theoretical basis for a promising safeguarding strategy that is applicable to improving the robustness and efficiency of Newton-like methods for general physics implicit reservoir simulation. The method is demonstrated for a range of models with growing complexity, including thermal compositional problem, and is compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. The damping algorithm is based on viewing the Newton iteration as a forward Euler discretization of the Newton flow equations. Three alternative a posteriori local discretization error estimates are developed. The first and second is are based on computable estimates of the norm of the derivative of the Newton step with respect to step-length. This estimate provides an accurate measure of the departure from the Newton flow path. The third estimate is based inspired by Richardson extrapolation idea. We propose to control the Newton step length by limiting the estimated local discretization error. The control strategy is conservative far from the solution, and can be shown to result in the standard Newton method otherwise. Computational results are presented for a series of simulation problems with increasing complexity. First, results for two phase flow simulations demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with, but not superior to current state-of-the-art strategies. For thermal, reactive, and multicomponent problems the method is compared to line-search methods. Superior robustness and computational efficiency are observed, and the iteration converges for significantly larger time-step sizes. These comparisons show that absent of tailored ad hoc strategies such as those recently proposed for black oil simulation, the proposed strategy is more robust and efficient than the current state-of-the art. This is demonstrated by testing the required number of iterations to convergence for different time-step sizes as well as during the course of full simulations. While several novel Newton damping strategies and alternative discretization with improved differentiability have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for multiphase flow simulation, this work provides a first step towards tailored robust safeguards for complex physics.

                    "abstract": "Standard reservoir simulation schemes use single-point upstream weighting for computing the convective fluxes when multi-phase/component fluids are present. These schemes are only first-order and may cause high viscosity effect. Second-order schemes provide a better resolution and reduce the smoothing near the shocks. In reservoir simulation practice, implicit discretisations capable of taking large time steps are preferred over explicit schemes. However, even for a simple first-order method, solving a large nonlinear system is often very expensive; Extra coupling and nonlinearity of the discretised equations can be introduced from a higher-order spatial discretisation. It has been shown that strong nonlinearity as well as lack of continuous differentiability in numerical flux function and flux limiter can cause serious nonlinear convergence problem. Cell-centered finite-volume (CCFV) discretizations may offer several attractive features, especially for fluid flow in heterogeneous or fractured porous media. The objectives of this work are to develop a fully-implicit CCFV framework that could achieve second-order spatial accuracy on smooth solutions, while at the same time maintain robustness and nonlinear convergence performance. We develop a novel multislope MUSCL method which interpolates the required values at the edge centroids in a simpler way by taking advantage of some geometric features of the triangular mesh. Through the edge centroids, the numerical diffusion caused by mesh skewness is significantly reduced, and optimal second-order accuracy can be achieved. An improved gradually-switching piecewise-linear flux-limiter is introduced according to mesh non-uniformity in order to prevent spurious oscillations. The smooth flux-limiter can achieve high accuracy without degrading nonlinear convergence behavior. For the discretization of pressure and Darcy velocities, a mimetic finite difference method that provides flux- continuity and an accurate total velocity field is used. The fully-coupled MFD-MUSCL framework is adapted to accommodate a lower-dimensional discrete fracture-matrix (DFM) model. Several numerical tests with discrete fractured system are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the numerical model. The results show that the high-order MUSCL method effectively reduces numerical diffusion, leading to improved resolution of saturation fronts compared with the first-order method. In addition, it is shown that the developed multislope method and adaptive flux limiter exhibit superior nonlinear convergence compared with other alternatives. "

                    "abstract": "There is considerable and timely interest in oil and condensate production from liquid-rich regions in shale gas reservoirs, placing emphasis on the ability to predict the behavior of gas condensate bank developments and saturation dynamics. As the pressure in the near-wellbore region drops below the dew-point, liquid droplets are formed and tend to be trapped in small pores. It has been suggested that injection of CO2 into shale gas reservoirs can be a feasible option to enhance recovery of natural gas and valuable condensate oil, while at the same time sequestering CO2 underground. This work develops simulation capabilities to understand and predict complex transport processes and phase behavior in these reservoirs for efficient and environmentally friendly production management. Although liquid-rich shale plays are economically producible, existing simulation techniques fail to include many of the production phenomena associated with the fluid system that consists of multiple gas species or phases. In this work, we develop a multicomponent compositional simulator for the modeling of gas-condensate shale reservoirs with complex fractured system. Related storage and transport mechanisms such as multicomponent apparent permeability (MAP), sorption and molecular diffusion are considered. In order to accurately capture the complicated phase behavior of the multiphase fluids, an Equation of State (EOS) based phase package is incorporated into the simulator. Because of the large capillary pressure that exists in the nanopores of ultra-tight shale matrix, the phase package considers the effect of capillary pressure on vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations. A modified negative-flash algorithm that combines Newton's method and successive substitution iteration (SSI) is used for phase stability analysis. We employ the developed simulator to study the combined effects of capillary pressure and multicomponent mechanisms on the phase behavior and hydrocarbon recovery in gas-condensate shale reservoirs. We present preliminary simulation studies to show the applicability of CO2 huff-n-puff for the purpose of enhanced hydrocarbons recovery. Several design components such as the number of cycles and the length of injection period in the huff-and-puff process are also briefly investigated. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: Unconventional reservoirs are often characterized by a multicontinuum stimulated formation with complex propped and unpropped fracture networks that occur over a wide range of length-scales and geometries. Coupled numerical simulation of geomechanics and flow and transport in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of production from these systems. Computational efficiency and accuracy are both critical for modern simulation workflows for engineering design. A mixed continuous-discrete fracture discretization approach is proposed whereby a single Cartesian mesh is applied, and discrete representations are embedded to capture primary fractures, whereas continuous representations may be used for well-connected natural fractures. The geomechanics is approximated using a hybrid extended finite element method (XFEM) for discrete fractures and a dual porosity-poroelasticity treatment for the continuous representations. The flow and transport in discrete fractures are approximated using an embedded-discrete-fracture model (EDFM), whereas the continuous representation is through a dual porosity treatment. In addition to validation and mesh refinement results, a number of computational examples are presented illustrating the first-order effects of the coupled physics in realistic models. Introduction Production from unconventional resources such as tight and shale-gas reservoirs involves the coupling of a number of complex multiphase flow and geomechanical phenomena. Unconventional reservoirs are comprised of an ultra-low permeability fractured matrix that may consist of multiple continua. Natural fractures form highly connected networks with a wide range of length scales. The fractures are primarily supported by pore pressure. Horizontal wells stimulated by hydraulic fractures that emanate from the wellbore along clusters within multiple stages. The fractures are supported by pore pressure as well as proppants that are delivered during the completions process. The proppant concentration may vary along fractures. Empirical observations from field practice suggest that geomechanical effects may play a first-order role in production from unconventional reservoirs. It is frequently observed that the production rate in tight gas reservoirs declines rapidly in a manner that is believed to be closely related to the evolution of fracture aperture and permeability with time (Huang and Ghassemi 2012). Proppant embedment and pore pressure-structure interactions can have a significant impact particularly within the interplay between offset wells. Numerical simulation of the coupled process in such formations can lead to an improved understanding of this interplay. Numerous models have been proposed to capture the effects of a range of complex constitutive relations for flow and transport including confinement and non-Darcy effects (Jiang and Younis, 2015; Wu et al., 2013). Models for that resolve the geomechanics in gas production systems are scarce due to the complexity of treatment for the coupling to flow and due to the presence of discontinuities in the form of discrete fractures. The influence of conductivity loss associated with discrete hydraulic fractures has also not been well studied. Therefore, coupled processes between matrix deformation and fluid flow are important to predict fracture permeability change and reservoir production behavior (Huang and Ghassemi 2012). "

Numerical simulation is a core kernel of reservoir-engineering work flows for reservoir evaluation, optimization, and management. Accurate and efficient numerical simulation of unconventional reservoirs is challenging. There is substantial physical complexity involving a number of tightly coupled mechanisms in the modeling of these reservoirs. The complexity is further amplified by the multicontinuum nature of the stimulated formation, and the complex fracture networks with a wide range of fracture-length scales and topologies. To adequately capture the effects of the multiscaled fracture system, we develop two alternative hybrid approaches that are aimed at combining the advantages of multicontinuum and discrete-fracture/matrix (DFM) representations. During the development of unconventional resources, geological and geophysical information may be available is some cases to suggest a prior characterization, whereas in many other cases, this prior model may be incomplete and limited to hydraulic fractures. The two hybrid approaches could be used for different applications depending on the available characterization data and different requirements for efficiency and accuracy considerations. The first hybrid model couples an embedded-discrete-fracture model (EDFM) with multiple interacting continua (MINC) into EDFM/MINC, which simulates the fracture network characterized by stimulated-reservoir-volume (SRV) concept. This optimized model can reduce the computational cost that is associated with the widely applied logarithmically spaced/locally refined (LS/LR) DFM technique, while improving the flexibility to model the complex geometry of hydraulic fractures. The MINC concept allows the hybrid model to handle the extreme contrast in conductivity between the small-scale fracture network and the ultratight matrix that results in steep potential gradients. For the second class of hybrid model (unstructured DFM/continuum), the primary fractures are described by use of DFM with unstructured gridding, and the small-scale fractures are simulated by continuum-type approaches in a fully coupled manner. Optimized local-grid refinement is used to accurately handle the transient-flow regime around primary fractures. An upscaling technique that applies EDFM on the detailed realization of the discrete-fracture network by use of the target unstructured grid to generate an appropriate dual-permeability model is also developed. The upscaling technique is suitable for cases where a detailed prior model for the complete fracture network is available. Simulation studies demonstrate the applicability of the developed hybrid-fracture models. Model verification is conducted against several reference solutions. "

Specifically, ES-MDA gives better data matches than EnKF, maintains the correct geology and appears to provide a better quantification of uncertainty than EnKF. However, if ES-MDA (or EnKF) is applied to update the rock-property fields where the underlying geological model is a facies model, then the boundaries between facies are not preserved. Here, we couple an ES-MDA update of the permeability field with an update of the distribution of facies for cases where both the distribution of geological facies and the distribution of permeability within each facies are unknown. To do this, the permeability field is represented as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), where the permeability within each facies is represented by a different Gaussian probability distribution. ES-MDA is applied to update the permeability field in the normal way, but after each ES-MDA iteration, the facies value in each reservoir simulator gridblock is updated by calculating the probability of each possible facies with respect to the GMM. In addition, the updated permeability distributions for each facies are remapped to the original Gaussian distribution. To keep the facies distribution consistent with the underlying geological model, which in this work is based on multi-point statistics (MPS), every several ES-MDA iterations, the facies distribution is regenerated by using the facies probability map as soft data and by using certain permeability values as the hard data to avoid destroying the data match. For the example considered in this paper, the procedure is able to provide good data matches as well as posterior facies maps and permeability fields that reflect the main geological features of the true model.

                    "abstract": "Locality is inherent to all subsurface flow and transport phenomena. While the spatial locality in the temporal evolution of state variables is well-studied, little is known about the locality that is present over the course of individual Newton iterations that arise in the solution of an implicit timestep. This work derives a priori sharp and conservative estimates for the Newton update before its corresponding linear system has been solved. While the current focus is the sequential implicit procedure for general nonlinear and heterogeneous two-phase flow in multiple dimensions, we outline the extension to fully-coupled multicomponent models. The estimates are universal to any accurate spatial discretization. There are numerous applications of these estimates, including their use towards characterizing the convergence rate of Newton's method as a function of timestep size, or towards the development of scalable linear preconditioning strategies. This work focuses on applying the estimates to reduce the size of the linear system that is to be solved at each Newton iteration. The key to the derivation of these estimates is in forming and solving the infinite-dimensional Newton iteration for the semidiscrete residual equations. In an implicit simulator, the Newton updates are accurate approximations to the continuous in space infinitedimensional updates. While the infinite dimensional updates are obtained by solving linear Partial Differential Equations (PDE) analytically, the discrete approximations are obtained by inverting a linear system. For flow, the analytical estimate for the Newton update is the solution of a linear constant coefficient screened Poisson equation. For transport, the estimate is the solution of a first-order linear PDE. The analytical solutions for these estimates are derived, and they can be applied computationally to any discrete problem. In a simulation, at each nonlinear iteration, the estimates are evaluated over parts of the domain and they are subsequently used to identify the unknowns and cells that will undergo a Newton update that is larger than any prescribed tolerance. The reduced linear system is then formed for these unknowns only, and is solved to obtain the Newton update. Since the estimates are conservative, there is no degradation of the nonlinear convergence rate. We present comprehensive large-scale computational results. The performance improvement using the proposed method directly depends on the extent of locality present as dictated by the physics. For problems with slight compressibility, the localization of the linear systems results in an order of magnitude of improvement in computational performance. On the other hand, incompressible models involve global pressure updates, and the locality is exploited in the transport part only. "

The hybrid model includes three domains: matrix, major hydraulic fractures and large-scale natural fractures (described by EDFM), and micro-fractures in SRV region which are modeled by dual-continuum approach. Embedded Discrete Fractures Model (EDFM) is an efficient approach for explicitly simulating large-scale fractures in Cartesian grid instead of complicated unstructured grid. Moreover, a nested-grid refinement method is used to capture the fluids transfer from matrix to fractures. Fully implicit scheme is applied for discretizing fluid equations, and the corresponding Jacobian matrix is evaluated by Automatic Differentiation with Expression Templates Library (ADETL). The AD-Library framework allows wide flexibility in the choice of variable sets and provides generic representations of discretized expressions for gridblocks. Several simulations and sensitivity analysis are performed with the developed research code for determining the key factors affecting shale gas recovery. Modeling studies indicate that the properties of fracture networks could greatly influence methane production. Different injection strategies including huff-n-puff process are also evaluated for optimizing production of multi-fractured horizontal well. Results show that CO2/N2 injection can be an effective approach with great application potential for enhancing shale gas recovery. "

                    "abstract": "Growing interest in understanding, predicting, and controlling advanced oil-recovery methods emphasizes the importance of numerical methods that exploit the nature of the underlying physics. The fully implicit method offers unconditional stability of the discrete approximations. This stability comes at the expense of transferring the inherent physical stiffness onto the coupled nonlinear residual equations that are solved at each timestep. Current reservoir simulators apply safeguarded variants of Newton's method that can neither guarantee convergence nor provide estimates of the relation between convergence rate and timestep size. In practice, timestep chops become necessary and are guided heuristically. With growing complexity, such as in thermally reactive compositional flows, convergence difficulties can lead to substantial losses in computational effort and prohibitively small timesteps. We establish an alternative class of nonlinear iteration that converges and associates a timestep to each iteration. Moreover, the linear solution process within each iteration is performed locally. By casting the nonlinear residual equations for a given timestep as an initial-value problem, we formulate a continuation-based solution process that associates a timestep size with each iteration. Subsequently, no iterations are wasted and a solution is always attainable. Moreover, we show that the rate of progression is as rapid as that for a convergent standard Newton method. Moreover, by exploiting the local nature of nonlinear wave propagation typical to multiphase-flow problems, we establish a linear solution process that performs computation only where necessary. That is, given a linear convergence tolerance, we identify a minimal subset of solution components that will change by more than the specified tolerance. Using this a priori criterion, each linear step solves a reduced system of equations. Several challenging examples are presented, and the results demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed method. "

                    "abstract": "Significant fluid loss while drilling through fractured formations is a major problem for drilling operations. From field experience, we know that the type and rheological parameters of the drilling fluid have a strong impact upon the rate and volume of losses. A mathematical model for Herschel-Bulkley [yield-power-law (YPL)] drilling-fluid losses in naturally fractured formations is presented. As a result, the effect of rheological properties of drilling fluid such as yield stress and shear-thinning/-thickening effect (flow-behavior index) on mud losses in fractured formations is investigated. We found that the yield stress can control the ultimate volume of losses while the shear-thinning effect can tremendously decrease the rate of losses. Therefore, mud losses in fractures can be minimized by optimizing the rheology of the drilling fluid properly. The model also allows for quantitative analysis of losses that take into account fluid rheology to characterize the fractures. Hydraulic aperture of conductive fractures can be obtained by continuously monitoring mud losses and fitting field records of mud losses to the model. The proposed model is very useful not only for drilling applications but also for well-completion design and fractured-reservoir-characterization purposes. To examine the validity of the model, a practical application of the proposed technique is demonstrated through a field example of mud-loss measurements in a fractured well in the Gulf of Mexico. "

                    "title": "The Effects of Drillstring-Eccentricity, -Rotation, and -Buckling Configurations on Annular Frictional Pressure Losses While Circulating Yield-Power-Law Fluids",
                    "abstract": "An experimental study followed by comprehensive flow modeling is presented. The experiments were conducted on a horizontal annulus with drillstring under compression, considering the influence of rotation on frictional pressure losses of yield-power-law (YPL) fluids. Flow through various buckling configurations with and without drillstring rotation was investigated. Correlations of critical Reynolds numbers are presented that predict the onset and offset of transition from laminar- to turbulent-flow regions in concentric and eccentric annuli. A broad model of flow of YPL fluids is proposed for concentric, eccentric, and buckled configurations. The model includes the effects of rotation in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. A 91-ft inner pipe was rotated while applying axial compression during flow. At the no-compression case, eccentricity of the inner pipe is varied as the drillstring rotated. The aim for such a design was to simulate actual drilling operations. The test matrix involves flow through sinusoidal, transitional, and helically buckled drillstring. The effect of pitch length is investigated. Helical modes with two different pitch lengths were tested. Eight distinct YPL fluids were used to examine the dependence of pressure losses on fluid parameters. In the theoretical part, a stability criterion is modified to determine the onset of transitional flow of YPL fluids and a correlation is proposed for practical purposes. In addition, pressure-loss-prediction models are presented for the flow of YPL fluids through concentric, eccentric, free, and buckled configurations of the drillstring, with and without rotation. The proposed models are compared with data from the literature and the experiments. It has been observed that increasing eccentricity and rotary speed causes an earlier transition from laminar to turbulent flow. Results suggest reduced pressure losses with an eccentric pipe. In addition, buckled configurations showed a further decrease of frictional pressure losses as the compression increases. In the helical mode, two pitch lengths are compared, and decreasing the pitch length resulted in a decrease in pressure losses. Rotation tests are conducted with free and buckled configurations. Rotation in the free-drillstring mode showed an increase in pressure losses as the rotary speed of the drillstring increases. Amplified vigorous motion of the drillstring is visually observed as the drillstring is buckled while rotating. Rotating the drillstring while buckled showed a further increase in pressure losses compared to rotating in free mode. This additional increase in pressure losses is attributed to the more-dynamic motion of the drillstring. Distinct differences of pressure losses in the effects of buckling and rotation are observed in laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. Significant differences are measured in the transition region. "

                    "abstract": "Ion/water transport between drilling fluid and shale formations can result in altered pore pressure in the shale. This chemically induced pore pressure plays an important role in controlling shale stability during drilling operations. In this paper analytic solutions are derived for a transient pressure transmission test on shale by solving the previously derived partially-coupled diffusivity equations taking into account chemical ionic flow effects. The diffusivity equations were solved under a no-flow boundary condition which is prescribed in a particular kind of transient pressure transmission test. By determining the three chemo-poroelastic coefficients KI (permeability coefficient), KII (membrane efficiency coefficient), and Deff (ion diffusivity) experimentally, the analytic solutions are compared with the actual experimental data. In general, a good agreement between the analytic solutions and the actual pressure measurements in the time-dependent pressure transmission tests has been found and is presented. The analytic solutions are provided for both the linear and cylindrical pressure transmission geometries. The pressure transmission experimental data discussed in this paper are from linear-geometry tests. Results presented in this paper can be used to study the transient pore pressure and stresses in the near-wellbore region, and to optimize the drilling fluid design (e.g., optimized salt type, salt concentration, optimized membrane efficiency, fluid pressure etc.).

                    "abstract": "The downhole pressure environment is one of the most important factors affecting the rate of penetration (ROP). It is believed that impermeable rocks experience high differential pressures because of shear dilatancy and become stronger and, thus, more difficult to drill. However, recently performed atmospheric and pressurized single-cutter experiments show that contrary to this belief, even at low pressures (100-200 psig) and even with permeable rocks, significant increase in mechanical specific energy (MSE) is observed compared to atmospheric tests. The experiments were carried out in a single-cutter high-pressure testing facility refurbished with high-precision sensors and a data acquisition system. In the experiments, a 13-mm polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) cutter was used to cut Carthage marble and Indiana limestone samples with depths of cut ranging from 0.025 to 0.050 in. More than 70 high-precision tests were performed on these two rock types under confining pressures ranging from 0 to 1000 psig. The confining fluids were either water or mineral oil. Unexpectedly, analysis of the MSE consistently showed that increases in the confining pressure as small as 150 psig can increase the MSE of the cutting process significantly and reduce the cutting efficiency by half. These reductions in the cutting efficiency that were even more dramatic in the permeable and saturated Indiana limestone could not be explained by the strengthening of the rock under confining pressures. Upon analysis of the results of experiments (cutting forces, volume of cuts, and visual inspections of cuttings), a new theory was proposed to explain this unexpected behavior. This new theory, based on the frictional forces and the cutting mechanism under pressure, gives useful insights into the physics of cutter-rock interaction. Such insights are invaluable to the improvements of drilling practices selection [weight on bit (WOB), type of drilling fluid, and its properties] and the ROPs. "

                    "abstract": "Although rotary drilling is being used in most wells, the impact of drillpipe rotation on hole cleaning during foam drilling has not been investigated. There has been no single predictive tool developed to address pipe rotation effects on foam drilling. This paper presents the first study of cuttings transport using foam with pipe rotation under simulated downhole conditions. A field-scale, high-pressure/high-temperature wellbore simulator with a 73-ft-long, 5.76 x 3.5-in. eccentric annular test section was used to investigate the effects of pipe rotation, foam quality and velocity, downhole pressure and temperature on cuttings transport, and pressure losses in a horizontal wellbore. Experiments were conducted with backpressures from 100 to 400 psi and temperatures from 80 to 160°F. Pipe rotary speeds were varied from 0 to 120 RPM, with foam qualities ranging from 60 to 90% and foam velocities from 2 to 5 ft/sec. It was found that pipe rotation not only significantly decreases cuttings concentration in a horizontal annulus but also results in a considerable reduction in frictional pressure loss. The reduction in cuttings concentration is up to 40% at a medium foam velocity (3 ft/sec) when pipe is rotated up to 120 RPM. The decrease in frictional pressure loss is up to 50% at a medium foam velocity and is more than 60% at a low velocity. Using a higher foam velocity or quality also improves hole cleaning; however, pressure losses are significantly increased. A mechanistic model and an associated computer simulator were developed for practical design and field applications. It can be used to predict cuttings concentration, bed height, and pressure drop during horizontal foam drilling with various pipe rotary speeds, eccentricities, foam qualities, and velocities under different pressure and temperature conditions. Comparisons between model predictions and experimental results show that the difference is less than 15% in most of the cases. "

                    "title": "The Effects of Back Rake and Side Rake Angles on Mechanical Specific Energy of Single PDC Cutters with Selected Rocks at Varying Depth of Cuts and Confining Pressures",
                    "abstract": "Abstract One of the key objectives within the drilling industry is optimizing rate of penetration (ROP) and a major contributor to obtaining this objective is the PDC bit design. Whilst previous papers have proven that the PDC cutting structure geometry, particularly back rake and side rake angles, affect PDC bit performance when tested at atmospheric conditions, no information in the SPE literature exists for similar tests at confining pressures. The effect of side rake angle on cutter aggresiveness and cutter interaction at depths of cut (DOC) in excess of 0.04?? are particularly unknown under confined pressure.  The results of more than 150 tests show that back rake and side rake angles have substantial effects on Mechanical Specific Energy (MSE) and the aggressiveness of PDC cutters. Experiments with three different rock types; Carthage marble, Mancos shale, and Torrey Buff sandstone, revealed that at both atmospheric and elevated confining pressures, PDC cutters with 10 deg back rake angles require half the energy to cut the same volume of rock and produce higher cutting efficiency compared with cutters having 40 deg back rake angles. Possible reasons for this behavior are explained through the analysis of the cutting process.  Results show that a cutter with low back rake requires less horizontal cutting force in order to cut the same volume of rock. This observation indicates that not only will a PDC bit with lower back rake angles, drill more efficiently, but it will also require less torque in order to drill at the same ROP. Other factors such as reduced durability of cutters at low back rake angles should also be considered while applying these results to PDC bit designs.  Test results at both atmospheric and confining pressures revealed that MSE decreases with increasing DOC up to 0.08?? on all three rock types. However, the tests also showed that MSE starts to increase slightly at DOCs above 0.08??, possibly suggesting an optimal minimum DOC.  Experimental results also show that, whilst Mancos shale and Carthage marble have about the same compressive strength, Mancos shale requires three times less energy to cut compared to Carthage marble. This indicates that, compressive strength of some rocks such as shales cannot be used alone as a reference rock property for accurately evaluating and comparing drilling efficiency.  A new 3D mechanistic PDC cutter-rock interaction model was also developed which incorporates the effects of both back rake and side rake angles, along with rock specific coefficient of friction. The results from this single-cutter model are encouraging as they are consistent with the experimental data. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract Instability issues often occur when water-based muds are applied to shale formations. Failure to predict the pore pressure accurately has been widely accepted as one of the major reasons causing shale instability. Water activity is a key factor to control the pore fluid moving in and out of the formation due to osmotic effects. Ideal and single-solute models have been developed in the past to predict the pore pressure by considering chemical osmotic effects. However, due to their complex nature, pore fluids/drilling fluids rarely behave as ideal solutions. A new model has been developed to predict pore pressure in shale formations that takes into account the non-ideality and multiple solutes of both drilling fluid and pore fluid. Transient pore pressure profiles and water activity are obtained from the coupled equations developed in this study. A Shale-Fluid Interaction Testing Cell (SFITC) has been developed in this study to test the interaction between the drilling fluid and the pore fluid. Parameters involved in the model, such as hydraulic conductivity, membrane efficiency and ion diffusion rate can be obtained through experimental data curve fitting. Model predictions have been compared with lab data and good agreement has been achieved. Water activity is found to be crucial for pore pressure control in shale formations. Simulation results explain the fact that salinity of drilling fluids has to be controlled in order to achieve shale stability. Results of this study can benefit drilling fluid design. Shale instability can be reduced by \"balancing?? the water activities of shale and drilling fluid. This can be achieved through changing the type of solutes and their concentrations based on information of the initial water activity of the shale. Wellbore stability models can obtain more accurate results by including the proposed pore pressure propagation model, which considers drilling fluid-induced chemical osmotic in-situ stress.  Introduction Currently more than 75% of drilled formations are shales and more than 90% of wellbore instability problems are related to shale formations (Dzialowski et.al., 1993). The common shale instability-related problems include tight spots, stuck pipe, hole caving, lost circulation, wellbore breathing and total wellbore collapse, which can result in well abandonment. Based on conservative reports, shale instability issues cost the oil and gas industry more than 6 billion U.S. dollars per year (SPE review, SPE-UK, 2005). Although shale instability has been studied for many years, it remains one of the major drilling challenges for the oil and gas industry. The solutions for shale problems have been trial and error, which results in high overall well-costs and rig-time losses.  It is well known that preventing pressure invasion into a shale matrix is an effective method in maintaining shale stability (Yeung 1993, van Oort 1997, Huang 1998, Yamamoto 2002, Zhang 2006, Russell 2008). Knowledge of pore fluid pressure is indispensible to address the wellbore stability problem. In the past, oil-based muds (OBM) and synthetic oil muds have been the preferred choices for drilling shale formations. Their application has been justified on the basis of borehole stability, penetration rate, fluid loss, filter cake quality, lubricity, and temperature stability. As environmental regulations have restricted the use of diesel and mineral oil-based muds, water-based muds (WBM) became attractive alternatives to oil-based mud systems from both cost and environmental perspectives. However, unlike oil-base mud, which could generate a considerable threshold capillary pressure to prevent the mud pressure penetrating into the near wellbore region, field applications of water-based muds for drilling shale formations often encountered wellbore stability problems.

                    "abstract": "A revolutionary cost-effective \"Microchip\" system capable of measuring temperature and pressure over the entire wellbore was developed and tested in the field. The Microchip system includes two major components: the surface devices and the \"tracer.\"  A tracer (~7.5 mm in diameter) consists of fiber optic sensors, a SoC IC (System-on-Chip, which includes micro-controller, memory, transmitter and receiver circuits) and a battery, all encapsulated in a protective chemical coating shell. The surface devices include an \"initiator?? to reset the circuit of the tracer and a \"data collector?? to retrieve data from the tracer using wireless communication. When used in the field, tracers will be injected together with the drilling fluid. As the tracer travels through the wellbore, it will measure the temperature and pressure through the entire wellbore and store the data in the on-chip memory. When the tracers are carried out of the borehole by the drilling fluid, a \"data collector?? will communicate with the tracer to download the data stored in the on-chip memory on the tracer. Thirteen tracers were injected in an 11,050ft well and circulated with a 13ppg mud at 400-500gpm. After travelling about 6.6km in the 8-3/8 inch wellbore to a depth of 11,050 ft, seven tracers returned to the surface successfully. The first tracer returned to the surface after 57 min. Data recorded on the tracer shows a bottom hole pressure of ~7500psi and flowing bottom hole temperature of ~190 degrees Fahrenheit. Results are consistent with the static bottom hole pressure and temperature.                The Microchip system can be used for subsurface measurement or as a diagnostic tool for identifying problematic zones. As an open platform, the Microchip system could also be expanded to other measurements by using different types of sensors. This Microchip system can be used in drilling and completion, pipeline monitoring and many other applications.  Introduction Modern exploration and production of oil/gas reserves require well-managed drilling operations. Acquisition of data (such as pressure and temperature) over the entire wellbore during drilling operations is critical for decision-making, reducing costs, and enhancing safety and efficiency. However, current Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) systems are very expensive and require additional personnel for operation and maintenance. In addition to the cost and manpower requirements, MWD systems are installed close to the drill bit and therefore can only measure the variables close to the drill bit, not the entire borehole. Besides that, most MWD systems use mudpulse telemetry to transfer data to the surface. Because mudpulse telemetry is very slow (about several bits per second), most MWD systems have to store the collected data in their memory and such data can be retrieved only after each bit run (significantly delayed information). Such an MWD system drastically increases the complexity of the drilling system. Therefore, a cost-effective, real-time subsurface instrument that can provide information for the entire borehole (not only information close to the drill bit) or test section is of great importance. The primary objective of this work is to develop a revolutionary measurement-while-drilling subsurface instrumentation system capable of measuring temperature and pressure over the entire wellbore in \"real-time\". The concept involves the application of large-scale, low-power, low-voltage mixed-signal integrated circuit design, chemistry (chemical coating), fluid mechanics and drilling engineering knowledge. This development is a cross-disciplinary collaboration of personnel with expertise in different fields (chemistry, electrical engineering, fluid mechanics and petroleum engineering). The instrumentation system developed in this work is not only useful for field applications but also for research purposes. "

                    "title": "Modeling Thermal Effects on Wellbore Stability",
                    "abstract": "Field evidence indicates that the thermal regime in wellbore considerably affects the wellbore stability in directional and horizontal wells. However, the temperature effects have not been investigated thoroughly in existing literature, and the effects of drilling fluid flow and various heat sources on the behavior of formation temperature profiles during different operations are often neglected. The affected formation temperature in the vicinity of the wellbore could result in different formation rock behaviors and consequent wellbore stability problems. This study is conducted to examine the effect of temperature on the stability of the near wellbore region, taking into account the heat transfer between formation and flowing drilling fluid with the consideration of mechanical friction and associated heat sources. A new model is proposed that is applicable to directional and horizontal wells. The model incorporates thermal effects due to the drag forces created from the contacts between drillpipe and casing/formation during drilling and tripping operations.  It is then utilized in a number of configurations of directional wells to study temperature profiles behaviors and their effects on wellbore stability. It is observed that the drilling fluid temperature is noticeably under-predicted by existing literature, and in some cases it can easily exceed the geothermal formation temperature if mechanical friction is taken into account. The formation temperature profile near the borehole region is also found to be considerably affected when wellbore heat transfer is considered, as opposed to the constant wall temperature approach in existing literature. These differences alternate the temperature induced stresses and consequently change the mud weight window for wellbore stability prediction. The proposed model and the results of this study are very useful for more accurate analyses of wellbore stability problems with a more detailed look into the effects of temperature. They can be used to enhance predictions of thermal regime in the wellbore at the design stage of well development or mud weight selection during drilling operation, thereby, avoiding potential drilling fluid/drillstring overheating and wellbore stability problems. Introduction The temperature profile during drilling extended reach (ERD) wells can be very different from those of more conventional wells. This temperature profile can be difficult to calculate. This occurs especially if the water depth is limited and cooling of the drilling fluid is insufficient. Several North Sea field examples during drilling long 17 ½?? and 12 ¼?? sections demonstrate that the fluid temperature can be far in excess of the maximum observed formation temperature in the well. One example is from a long 17 ½?? ERD section where the maximum formation temperature was close to 45°C, while the maximum observed drilling fluid temperature in the annulus was 86°C. Even the temperature on the shaker was more than 60°C. Indications exist that the increase in drilling fluid temperature is larger if hole cleaning is good. "

                    "abstract": "The thermal regime of a formation in the vicinity of a wellbore affects the stability of the well significantly during drilling operations, especially for deeper or geothermal wells. This paper describes how the thermal behavior of a tubular-wellbore-reservoir system is altered with time during mud loss, as well as its consequent impact on wellbore state of stresses and critical mud weights. A new coupled thermal-poro-elastic model, integrated with a transient tubular-wellbore-reservoir heat flow model, is developed to evaluate near-wellbore stresses and pore pressure redistribution during a mud loss. The results reveal that continuous mud loss destabilizes the near-wall region as the fracture gradient decreases over time. This can intensify the existing fracturing condition and allows the development of new fractures at other locations, which leads to further losses as time progresses. During severe losses, the fracture gradient at the bottom of the well can decrease by over 1 ppg within the first few hours. The time- dependent critical mud weight window and near-wellbore state of stresses under different lost circulation conditions and types of muds (OBM/WBM) are presented to evaluate the effects of different parameters. This model allows prediction of a more realistic operating window during lost circulation by taking additional thermally-induced effects into account. 1. INTRODUCTION Wellbore instability is a major source of additional costs to drilling operations, and is therefore of paramount importance to avoid when drilling for petroleum production. It is more likely to occur when drilling in hostile environments, such as weak and/or reactive formations; formations with tectonically active beddings [1]; formation with unfavorable lithology sequences; and formation with high pressures and temperatures [2]. In addition, the increasing use of directional drilling and extended-reach drilling (ERD)[3], as well as underbalanced drilling and multilateral drilling[4], has increased the difficulty of maintaining stability of the wells significantly[5,6]. Wellbore stability problems have been extensively studied during the last few decades. Many wellbore stability models have been developed to describe the physics of the systems by considering multiple effects, including but not limited to mechanical effects, pore pressure effects, chemical effects, and thermal effects. Based on the effects that have been taken into account, the wellbore stability models can be categorized as: pure elastic model[7,8,9]; poro-elastic models[10,11]; thermal-poro-elastic models [2,12,13,14] ; chemo-poro-elastic models [15,16,17,18,19]; thermo-chemo-poro-elastic models [20,21], etc. "

                    "abstract": "One of the major concerns when drilling deepwater wells is fluid loss since the fracture gradients are typically lower than their onshore counterparts. Failure to minimize the fluid loss can significantly increase the cost of drilling, and even lead to abandonment of the well. Successful management of lost circulation should incorporate accurate estimation of loss zone location, followed by corresponding lost circulation control procedures. This paper presents an innovative way to estimate the location of mud loss by interpreting distributed temperature measurement which is facilitated by a recently developed drilling microchip technology. Firstly, a transient wellbore thermal model is presented to predict the effect of mud loss on the change in circulating mud temperature profile for tubular fluids. The model is developed based on heat balance equations with variable local flow rates along the wellbore due to the mud loss. The effects of heat transfer above the seabed between riser and the drilling muds are included. Downward shifts in the temperature curves are noted in both the drillpipe and annulus. With distributed temperature measurement data, the derivative of annulus temperature with respect to depth can be used to effectively identify the location of the loss zone. A case study has been conducted to identify the location of a loss zone in a deepwater well. According to the results, a jump in the derivative coincides with the location of loss and is sufficiently significant in magnitude to be identified. The seawater-riser heat transfer has minimum effect on the loss zone prediction; furthermore, the effect of the same amount of loss is more conspicuous if the loss occurs at a shallower depth, in which case the loss zone can be more reliably located.

                    "abstract": "Abstract In horizontal and highly deviated portions of an Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) well, cuttings beds form on the low-side of the annulus. The bed partially blocks the annulus resulting in excessive pressure loss and a higher equivalent circulating density (ECD) that is exacerbated by the increase in length of the annulus. This condition limits hole-cleaning capabilities. As a result, selecting favorable drilling parameters is not always sufficient to overcome the hole cleaning problem. Recently, the use of downhole Mechanical Cleaning Devices (MCDs) has been introduced to the industry to mitigate the problem without inducing excessive ECD. Although the use of these tools is increasing, very limited studies have been conducted to optimize their performance.  This paper presents results of an experimental study that was carried out to evaluate cuttings removal efficiency of MCDs and applications of MCDs for optimizing ERD systems. Experiments were carried out in a large-scale flow loop that has an 8-inch transparent test section. Three different drillpipe sizes were considered in the investigation. The Taguchi approach was implemented to reduce the number of experiments while covering the most relevant parameters such as flow rate, ROP, diameter ratio, tool design and drillpipe rotation speed. For each test, the amount of cuttings accumulated in the test section was determined from weight measurements. Results indicate that the tools significantly reduce the amount of cuttings in the annulus, especially around the MCDs, compared to locations where there is no tool.  Experimental results were evaluated to obtain the overall effect of operating parameters on annular cuttings concentration and develop correlations. The results show that the flow rate and inclination angle have the most significant impact. The correlations are useful to develop an analytical model for designing and optimizing drilling systems with MCDs, either in terms of operating parameters or drillstring design.  1. Introduction Efficient cuttings transport is an important issue in drilling highly deviated and horizontal wells. In directional wells, drilled cuttings tend to accumulate on the lower side of the annulus and form a thick cuttings bed when the flow velocity becomes insufficient to suspend the cuttings bed particles. Particularly, in high-angle and horizontal boreholes, the formation of thick cuttings bed can give rise to numerous difficulties such as lost circulation, differential sticking, high torque and drag. Recently, hydro-mechanical hole cleaning devices such as HydrocleanTM tools have been developed to enhance cuttings transport efficiency in directional wells. These tools are introduced in the drillstring with different spacing arrangements. "

                    "abstract": "Conventional well control procedures rely merely on the pit gain and variations in pump pressure as the primary indicators to detect and handle the influx. These indicators are rudimentary and unreliable for drilling costly offshore wells while advanced well control techniques demand more reliable indicators for early detection of gas kicks. Having access to continuous pressure data along the wellbore, offered by intelligent (wired) drillpipes, can be very helpful in detecting and handling gas kicks. This paper proposes a technique for early gas detection during conventional drilling by utilizing the intelligent drill pipe. For this purpose, different flow regions in the annulus are identified and modeled based on the conservation equations. A numerical scheme and transient gas kick simulator are developed to solve the equations. Sensitivity analysis is conducted for various parameters such as influx sizes, mud flow rates and wellbore geometry. The results indicate that when gas influx enters the wellbore, pressure at all sensors increases simultaneously. This criterion can be used for early detection of gas kicks; In addition, when top of gas influx passes a certain sensor, pressure curve at that sensor declines. This fingerprint can be utilized in determining the location of the gas kick. This can be done even more precisely when pressure derivative curves are plotted to determine the time that a gas influx reaches a certain sensor. Using intelligent drill pipes in modern well control operations can reduce kick detection time to less than half, which results in significant reduction in non-productive time and enhancements in safety. The developed simulator provides a powerful tool that can contribute to well control practices and real-time decision making. "

Both theoretical and experimental approaches are followed to better understand the onset of transitional flow. The objective of this study is to investigate the stability of the flow in concentric and eccentric annuli. Theoretical analysis of the inner and outer shear regions, to clarify the earlier transition observed with experimental studies, are within the scope of this study. A stability criterion based on the ratio of turbulent energy production and rate of work done by viscous stresses is used to determine the end of laminar flow. Experiments are conducted for laminar, transition and turbulent regions of flow in a fully eccentric annulus. Eight distinct YPL fluids are tested and the results are compared with a proposed model and models available in the literature. The proposed stability parameter shows an earlier transition near the outer wall for a wide range of non-Newtonian fluids, which is in agreement with measurements in the literature. The proposed modification is extended to eccentric annuli and showed good agreement with experiments. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first theoretical study to locally predict the onset of transition in eccentric annuli of YPL fluids. Transition from laminar to turbulent significantly depends on eccentricity, diameter ratio and fluid properties, especially to the shear thinning ability of a fluid. The proposed modification allows a fair prediction of the transition from laminar to turbulent regions in eccentric annuli. With the proposed approach, the percentage of laminar and non-laminar regions for a cross section of an eccentric annulus can be predicted. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract: There has been an increasing consciousness regarding to the stress changes associated with reservoir depletion as the industry moves toward more challenging jobs in deep-water or depleted reservoirs. These stress changes have a significant impact on the design of wells in these situations. Therefore, accurate prediction of reservoir stress path, i.e., change in horizontal stresses with pore pressure, is of vital importance. In this paper, a new formulation of stress path is developed that enable us to predict the effect of pore pressure on both minimum and maximum horizontal stresses in the presence of non-hydrostatic stress field for future well design consideration. According to the results, change of minimum horizontal stress with pore pressure is always larger than the change of maximum horizontal stress. Non-equal change of horizontal stresses increases the difference between them during production history. Using the new formulation, we are able to find the effect of pore pressure on formation fracture pressure in deviated wells, as well. Fracture initiation pressure change with pore pressure is larger parallel to the direction of maximum horizontal stress. Thus, we would have less wellbore instability problems if we drill toward the minimum horizontal stress direction after depletion. "

                    "abstract": "While drilling through depleted or partially depleted reservoirs, one may encounter a series of problems (e.g., lost circulation, non-productive time, etc.) due to narrow mud weight window (MWW). Fracture-based strengthening techniques used in the industry effectively increase fracture reopening pressure (FROP) and ultimately reduce the cost of associated problems. However, traditional analytical and numerical studies using these techniques do not consider the time effect and usually ignore the fluid dynamics. Thus, these deficiencies may result in inaccurate wellbore strengthening operations if no proper fracture diagnostic techniques are available to acquire the real-time fracture geometry. In this paper, a quasi-static, dislocation-based fracture model is extended using fluid mass conservation with leak-off. A fixed dimensionless fracture coordinate system is employed and a numerical simulation procedure is developed. The model is capable of predicting real-time fracture geometry (both fracture width and length) from given wellbore conditions. Hence, it could provide optimal particle size distribution (PSD) selection for wellbore strengthening applications. Two case studies are performed and results reveal different fluid controlling mechanisms during the fracture propagation, which are fluid storage in fractures and fluid leak-off to surrounding formation. Drilling through low permeability reservoirs (e.g., tight gas reservoirs or shale reservoirs) is different from drilling in conventional reservoirs because fast propagation of induced fractures may interact with natural fractures and result in severe lost circulation. This model is of critical importance in designing wellbore strengthening operations during drilling. "

In this paper, a dynamic fracture model based on the dislocation method is employed to qualitatively characterize the influence of controllable parameters on fracture propagation and fracture reopening pressure (FROP). Fracture propagation length and profile are obtained for each parameter with different values. It is found that fluid injection rate, fluid viscosity, fluid injection time, wellbore inclination and wellbore radius have an inverse relationship with FROP. On the other hand, fracture plug width has a positive relationship with FROP. Finally, a procedure for determining optimal wellbore strengthening operations by manipulating the controllable parameters is developed based on the dynamic fracture model. "

                    "abstract": "A new generation of a near real-time, cost-effective distributed downhole temperature and pressure measurement system that utilizes improved microchip technology was developed in the laboratory and tested in the field. The improved microchip technology splits temperature and pressure measurement into two individual systems. Design of the printed circuit board and the electrical components has minimized the measurement error and power comsumption of the system. Significant improvements in the integrity of the drilling microchip have been achieved by using a new protective material. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the system measurement is within ±0.5°C for temperature measurements and ±0.05% for pressure measurements. The drilling microchip is typically deployed by using a tracer injection system continuously (controlled by a computer) or by dropping it into the drillpipe while making a pipe connection during rig operation. It travels along the inner passage of the drillpipe, exits the bit nozzle, and returns toward the surface in the wellbore annulus because of dynamic circulation with drilling fluid. Then, it is usually captured at the shale shaker at the surface. A total of 14 new generation tracers were deployed into two different wells in two batches (4 pieces and 10 pieces) during the field evaluations in Saudi Arabia. Nine of the deployed 14 microchips were recovered at the surface with the measurement data stored in the on-chip memory. The results of the field tests proved that the microchip system is able to survive in a well with 13,800ft vertical depth under more than 150°C bottomhole temperature and 10,000 psi bottomhole pressure conditions. Measurements retrieved from the recovered microchips show excellent consistency. The circulating mud temperature in the field test well has also been predicted by using existing thermal model. The modeling result has been compared to the microchip measurements and it shows a strong agreement between two temperature profiles inside the drillpipe. However, the modeling result is probably not accurate in the annular section based on comparison to the microchip measurements. The new generation microchip system developed is ready to be deployed in most oilfield conditions to provide a downhole in-situ circulating mud temperature and pressure (i.e., equivalent circulating density) profiles for optimizing cement formulation as well as identifying hole problems such as seepage, lost circulation zones, and open-hole restriction due to poor hole cleaning or an under-gauged hole.

The fluid flow and heat transfer numerical model in estimating the transient mud circulating temperature profiles during a lost circulation event was developed. The temperature profile in both the flow conduits (drillpipe and annulus) were modeled using mass and energy balances. The flow rate of drilling mud decreases in the annulus above the loss zone as part of the fluids lost into the fractures, which in turn alters the heat transmission status between the drillpipe, annulus, and near-wellbore formation. The wellbore is divided into two sections, which accounts for single loss zone. Case studies were performed and numerical solution results were presented and analyzed. According to the results, alterations induced by mud loss include: 1) Declines in both annular mud temperature and drillpipe mud temperature over time, and 2) Discontinuity in the first order derivative of annular mud temperature with respect to depth at the location of loss. By matching the simulated results with the distributed temperature measurements at different time stamps, the depth of the loss zone can be identified. "

In this study, the moisture adsorption to shale surfaces is investigated to identify the proper isotherm type curve. It is shown that the moisture content of shale is correlated with water activity using a multilayer adsorption theory. It is found that the GAB model (developed by Guggenheim, Anderson and De Boer) fairly well describes the adsorption process for the selected shale types. Accordingly, the moisture content is correlated with water activity through the GAB model, which is incorporated into the transport equations. The adsorption parameter signifies the characteristic of a specific shale that interacts with aqueous fluids and can be introduced as an index to characterize different shale formations. In this study, the constitutive equations are generalized to consider the case of non-ideal solutions. The coupled transport equations are solved using a finite difference method and numerical computations are conducted to predict the stability of the wellbore. Having developed a transient model that predicts the instantaneous moisture content around the wellbore, it is possible to update the rock compressive strength as a function of its moisture content using available empirical correlations in the literature. The results of this analysis indicate that the range of safe mud weight reduces substantially due to moisture adsorption. Comparisons of several compressive failure criteria indicate that stability reduction of the wellbore due to moisture transport is a common pattern based on the selected criteria.

The simulation includes effects of various operational parameters, such as rate of penetration, fluid loss as well as pump rate schedules. The mathematical model of heat transfer was developed for a deviated offshore well profile to make the algorithm flexible for different applications. The upwind numerical discretization scheme is used for determination of temperature profile. The temperature prediction of the model was verified with available analytical models for a vertical onshore well. The hydraulic model employs the yield power-law rheology model. The local density of drilling fluid as a function of temperature and pressure is evaluated using the available PVT correlations. It is shown that when mud circulation stops, the equivalent static density slightly increases with time. The results of simulation also indicate that during circulation, a higher equivalent circulating density is expected as compared to the case of constant fluid density. The results of the developed method are compared with downhole temperature and pressure data in an offshore well. The comparison indicates that the developed model has a good accuracy to track the bottom-hole circulating temperature and pressure.

A practical numerical model is proposed that accurately estimates the annular frictional pressure losses with and without the inner pipe rotation. Experiments are conducted at a 91 ft. long flow loop using various fluids that can be characterized as Yield Power Law (YPL). A commercial CFD software is used to validate the proposed numerical approach. A comprehensive comparison of the proposed model, CFD results, experimental results, the published experimental results and most widely used models from the literature is presented. The experimental setup simulates horizontal wellbore applications, which are increasingly prevalent due to recent shale plays. Today, since most drilling fluids show YPL behavior, YPL fluids with a wide range of rheological properties are used as test fluids in this study. The numerical model is coupled with a stability criterion that determines the onset and offset of the transitional flow between laminar and turbulent regions. The velocity profiles of a wide range of diameter ratios, Taylor and Reynolds numbers are presented. Various degrees of eccentricity are analyzed in terms of pressure profile and flow stability with the proposed method. The results from the experiments show significantly reduced pressure drops in fully eccentric annuli compared to concentric geometry. An increase in pressure loss is observed as the pipe is rotated while it is eccentric. The comparisons between the models indicate that the slot approximation can result in large errors especially when the diameter ratio is low. A 3D wellbore can be evaluated with grids using the proposed numerical method and the local stability criterion, which leads to accurate pressure loss estimations. Grid analysis can show the flow state profile and the pressure loss profile of a wellbore, which has potential to optimize operations in real-time or in the design phase. This study contributes to a better understanding of flow in annuli. The results obtained from this study are useful to predict the transition and the annular frictional pressure loss profiles more accurately than existing methods.

In this paper several methods for evaluating dynamic barite sag in oil-based drilling fluids are examined in a flow loop with the use of a rotational viscometer modified by the addition of a sag shoe (MRV). Tests using the MRV in the range of 0–100 RPM were conducted, and the effects of rotation speed on sag were correlated with flow loop tests performed by varying the inner pipe rotation speed. The combined effects of eccentricity and pipe rotation on dynamic barite sag in oil-based drilling fluids are also described in this paper. Flow loop test results indicate that pipe rotation has a greater impact on reducing sag when the pipe is eccentric rather than concentric. Additionally, results in the MRV indicate a strong correlation between the test RPM and the degree of measured sag. "

                    "abstract": "A chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model considering the shale transverse isotropic effect is developed. In poroelastic theory, the pore fluid motion and solid structure deformation are coupled. Lubinski's one-way coupling scheme is adopted in this study which assumed a rock has strong structure and the effect of solid skeleton deformation on fluid flow is negligible. It is found that normal stress along the cylindrical axis is affected by Young's modulus on both the symmetrical plane and the axial direction. A Taguchi orthogonal simulation design strategy is adopted to reduce the number of simulations while still achieving meaningful results. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is conducted and parameter contributions to the mud weight window have been investigated. It can be found that among the 11 parameters of interest, wellbore inclination angle, hydraulic conductivity and water activity of drilling fluid play the most important roles in determining the mud weight window. Knowledge of percentage contributions of the parameters in this chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model greatly helps drilling engineers identify the critical factors for wellbore stability control. This study also helps well trajectory design and drilling fluid optimization. Introduction Drilling the wellbore is usually the most expensive step in oil and gas exploration activities. It is reported that wellbore instability issues cost the petroleum industry alone an estimated 8 billion US dollars annually (Diwan 2011). As a consequence, designing a good drilling strategy has significant importance in petroleum engineering. Wellbore instability in drilling shale formations with water based mud has been studied for many years but still a big challenge for drilling engineers. Prior to drilling, a shale formation is in a state of mechanical, hydraulic and chemical equilibrium. Drilling disturb these natural equilibrium, resulting in the alteration of local stresses by deformation of the borehole and enforcement of hydraulic and chemical potential gradients. Shales are sedimentary rock characterized by their finely laminated structure, low permeability, high clay content and cation exchange capacity.  The mechanical properties along the bedding plane are different from the mechanical properties through the thickness direction. As a consequence, shale should not be simply considered as isotropic material. Numerous wellbore instability problems have been reported when drilling through laminated and chemically reactive shale formations(Last et al.1995; Okland et al.1998; Beacom et al.2001). Wellbore stability models considering anisotropic body(Amadei 1983; Abousleiman et al.1995) are not rare while wellbore stability models considering a shale's chemical effect(Ghassemi et at. 1999; Yu et al. 2003) are not rare neither. However, few of the wellbore stability models take into account shale's chemical effect and anisotropic effect together. Therefore, a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model considering shale isotropic effect is developed in this paper to better analyze the stress distribution near the wellbore region. "

                    "abstract": "Eccentricity of the annulus can greatly affect the velocity profile, especially in extended-reach wells and slimholes. While frictional pressure losses in concentric and fully eccentric annuli have been studied before, this paper focuses on the effect of arbitrary eccentricities on velocity profile and corresponding influence on frictional pressure losses. In this study, axial flow of yield-power-law (YPL) fluids in eccentric annuli for a 2D steady-state flow has been investigated numerically and verified against experiments. A boundary-fitted coordinate system is used to discretize the flow equations and generate the mesh network. Fluid-flow equations were solved adopting an iterative method. The results of simulation include the effects of fluid rheology, flow rate, annulus dimensions, and eccentricity on velocity profile and frictional pressure losses in the annulus. Numerical results were compared with the available extensive experimental investigations on the flow of a variety of drilling fluids that have a strong shear-thinning property and high yield stress (e.g., polymer-based and bentonite fluids). The tests were implemented over a wide range of flow rates using a flow loop that is equipped with a pipe viscometer and several annular test sections with various sizes and eccentricities. Field observations, experimental data, and the analytical approach in this study indicate that increasing eccentricity lowers frictional pressure drop in the annulus. A good agreement was observed between the numerical-simulation results and experimental measurements. Comparison of the present and past studies with analytical solutions of Newtonian fluids in an eccentric annulus shows that the current study provides more-accurate results. Detailed numerical simulation and the equations that are presented in this study can be used by investigators. The application of the Cartesian and boundary-fitted coordinate systems and algebraic correlations for geometry transformations are presented. Moreover, the exact method of flow-rate calculation based on the velocities at each gridpoint is shown in the provided details. The application of findings in this study includes more-accurate predictions of velocity profile and frictional pressure loss in the annulus, which lead to better predictions of barite sag, cuttings transport, equivalent circulating density, and mud cement displacement in special cases of cementing operations.

                    "abstract": "ABSTRACT:A new concept called “Safe Salinity Window” is introduced to help drilling engineers determine the proper salinity level in drilling fluids. Safe Salinity Window can be obtained from a chemo-poro-elastic wellbore stability model, which incorporates drilling fluid-induced chemical osmotic in-situ stress. A multiple solute, non-ideal solution pore pressure transmission model is adopted in this study for accurately predicting the pore pressure term in a wellbore stability model. It has been found that both compressive failure index and tensile failure index are a function of pore pressure. It is also found that the salinity of drilling fluids will cause chemical osmotic pressure and further affect the effective principle stresses. Increasing salinity will decrease the chances of compressive failure but may move the drilled section closer to the tensile failure boundary. Mohr-Coulomb criterion gives more conservative salinity value to predict compressive failure than the prediction from Modified-Lade criterion.  1. INTRODUCTION  Problems with shale stability have plagued the drilling industry for more than fifty years. Based on conservative report, shale instability issues cost the oil and gas industry more than 6 billion U.S. dollars worldwide annually [1]. Common shale instability related problems include tight spots, stuck pipe, hole caving, lost circulation, wellbore breathing, high cementing cost, cementing failure, and total wellbore collapse. Although shale instability has been studied for many years, it remains one of the major drilling challenges for the oil and gas industry. Attempts to solve shale problems have largely been by trial and error, which results in high overall well costs and rig-time losses. Knowledge of pore pressure is critical for wellbore stability since it affects the effective principle stress. It is widely accepted that preventing pressure invasion into a shale matrix is an effective method for maintaining shale stability [2-6].  "

                    "abstract": "The presence of weak planes in rock fabric along with interactions of clay minerals with aqueous fluids are the major causes of instability in shale formations. Reviewing the current state-of-the art of wellbore stability models indicates that the interaction of aqueous fluids with clay minerals has been ignored or over-simplified due to the complexity of the processes. In this paper, a diffusion-sorption model, which is considered to be a unified model for all shale types, is integrated with a wellbore stability model. The coupled transport equations are solved using a finite difference method to determine pore pressure and moisture content in the vicinity of the borehole. The wellbore stability is analyzed using the modified Jaeger's criterion, which considers shale to be an isotropic body containing one set of weakness planes. Using field data, a comparison between the anisotropic failure model and isotropic failure model is presented. The results indicate that the wellbore is less stable when bedding planes are considered. The sensitivity analysis shows that the extent of failure zone in the vicinity of borehole is primarily governed by the orientation of wellbore trajectory with respect to the bedding planes. Furthermore, it is shown that the intrinsic rock strength anisotropy can be a significant parameter for failure analysis when shear failure along the bedding plane is not a major concern. The presented model predicts the instantaneous moisture content around the borehole, which is used as an index for estimation of rock strength both in shale matrix and along weakness planes. The simulation results shows that shale-fluid interaction affects borehole stability at early times. "

                    "abstract": "A numerical and experimental analysis is conducted on the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in annuli. A numerical model is presented that accurately estimates the annular frictional pressure losses with and without the inner pipe rotation. The numerical model is validated using a CFD software. Experiments are conducted at a 27 m long flow loop using various fluids that can be characterized as Yield Power Law (YPL). The results of the experiments are compared with the results obtained with the numerical model. Today, the most drilling fluids show YPL behavior. The proposed numerical model can calculate the equivalent circulating density while circulating YPL fluids accurately. The model is validated with a CFD software and compared with experimental results, the published experimental results and with the slot approximation. The results obtained from the numerical model shows good agreement with the experiments and also with the experimental results from the literature. The comparisons between the models indicate that the slot approximation can result in large errors especially when the diameter ratio is low, meaning the diameter of the inner pipe is significantly smaller compared to outer pipe. The numerical model is coupled with a stability criterion that determines the onset and offset of the transitional flow between laminar and turbulent regions of YPL fluids. Various degrees of eccentricity are analyzed in terms of pressure profile and flow stability with the proposed method. This study contributes to a better understanding of flow in annuli. The results obtained from this study are useful to predict the transition and the annular frictional pressure loss profiles more accurately than existing methods. Potential applications include risk avoidance and optimized operations. "

                    "title": "Experimental Study and Modelling of Barite Sag in Annular Flow",
                    "abstract": "The phenomenon of settlement of weighting-material particles in drilling fluid is known as barite sag, which can lead to a number of drilling problems including lost circulation, well-control difficulties, poor cementing operation, and stuck pipe. This study investigates barite sag, both experimentally and numerically, in the annulus under flow conditions. Settlement of the weighting materials is generally called barite sag because barite is the most popular weight material used in drilling industry. The experimental part of the study has been conducted using a flow loop with 35-ft-long annulus test section to investigate the effects of fluid velocity in annulus, annulus eccentricity, pipe rotation, and inclination angle on barite sag. Density of the flowing fluid is measured continuously using Coriolis densitometers at the inlet and outlet of the annular test section. The simulation part of this study is based on a proposed particle- tracking method called “particle-elimination technique.” In this method, falling and axial velocities of the solid particles are estimated to predict their travelling paths. Density of the flowing fluid is updated, taking into account the number of particles that become stationary by reaching the casing wall. To model the downward motion of the barite bed on an inclined bed, the analogy of falling film of a viscous liquid on an inclined plane is applied. Velocity of the falling barite bed is calculated on the basis of an apparent viscosity approximated by the experiments. Knowing the velocity of the moving bed, the mass rate of barite downstream of the bed, which goes back into the main flow stream, is calculated and a new density for the moving fluid is achieved. The numerical simulation is modified from laboratory scale to real wellbore dimensions to be used for practical drilling applications. Results of the tests indicate that the highest sag occurs at low annular velocities, low rotational speeds, and high inclination angles. Barite-sag reduction caused by decreasing the inclination angle continues until the inclination-angle values are approximately 60 degrees, after which it becomes insignificant. Another observation made from experimental results and simulation work is that as the circulation of the drilling fluid in the loop continues, the fluid density decreases until it reaches an equilibrium stage. The equilibrium stage occurs faster for lower inclination angles. Effects of annular velocity and inner-pipe rotational speed on barite sag are similar; however, they are different from the trend observed when the inclination angle changes. Eccentricity of a nonrotating inner pipe did not have a significant effect on barite sag. However, the effect of inner-pipe rotation on barite sag for an eccentric annulus is more significant than in the concentric case. Comparing the results of numerical simulation with the experimental study shows a good agreement. The proposed simulation approach in this study can be used for barite-sag predictions in the annulus. A good prediction of the barite sag can prevent hazardous situations and would help engineers in drilling wells to spend less money and time. "

                    "abstract": "This paper identifies wellbore stability concerns caused by transient surge and swab pressures during deepwater drilling tripping and reaming operations. Wellbore stability analysis is presented that couples transient surge and swab wellbore pressure oscillations and in-situ stress field oscillations in the near wellbore (NWB) zone in deepwater drilling. Deepwater drilling is usually subjected to narrow drilling windows and significant wellbore pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming because of well depth. However, integration of transient surge and swab pressure analysis, and its effects on in-situ stress analysis around the wellbore, is rarely industry studied. A transient surge and swab model is developed by considering drillstring components, wellbore structure, formation elasticity, pipe elasticity, fluid compressibility, fluid rheology, etc. Real-time pressure oscillations during tripping/reaming are obtained. Based on geomechanical principles, in-situ stress around the wellbore is calculated by coupling transient wellbore pressure with surge and swab pressure, pore pressure, and original formation stress status to perform wellbore stability analysis. By applying the breakout failure and wellbore fracture failure in the analysis, a workflow is proposed to obtain the safe operating window for tripping and reaming processes. Based on this study, it is determined that the safe drilling operation window for wellbore stability consists of more than just fluid density. The oscillation magnitude of transient wellbore pressure can be larger than the friction pressure loss during normal circulation process. With the effect of surge and swab pressure, the safe operating window can become narrower than expected. Although it is stable and not a concern during a normal penetration process, the wellbore stability can become problematic. By using the methodology described, unnecessary breakouts and borehole failures during tripping and reaming can be avoided. This work can also be used in the next generation of drilling automation. This study provides insight into the integration of wellbore stability analysis and transient surge and swab pressure analysis, which is rarely discussed in the literature. It indicates that, when surge and swab pressure analysis is not carefully performed, the actual safe operating window can become narrower than originally predicted. "

Introduction Over the last two decades, extended and mega reach wells, followed by multilaterals, have been common practices through the industry because they provide multiple solutions for restricted reservoir production, such as reaching larger areas from one surface location and keeping the well in the reservoir through longer departures. These distinct advantages of such wells have opened up new opportunities for many operators to improve hydrocarbon recoveries in such a way that drilling and future intervention costs make sense. Consequently, the ERD envelope has expanded rapidly and more challenging operational considerations have been faced with. Although it is a straight forward and well understood operational practice for conventional wells, running long casing strings in extended or mega reach wells has emerged as one of the most challenging operations due to the increasing level of drag between casing and the wellbore as step-out ratios have increased by the help of emerging technologies. One idea to overcome the issue of drag encountered when running long casing strings and sliding drilling is to reduce the effective weight of tubular, consequently the contact force by the use of buoyancy. However, the shortcoming with flotation methodologies is such that the buckling resistance of buoyed tubular also tends to be low. "

Experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of pipe inclination on entrainment fraction in air/water annular flow with inclination angles of 0, 10, 20, 45, 60, 75, and 90° from horizontal. Two techniques were used to measure the entrainment fraction: film removal and isokinetic sampling. The experimental results were compared with existing models and correlations, and the best predicting methods were determined for all flow orientations. An inclination effect on entrainment fraction was observed. This effect occurred at low superficial gas velocities and was more prominent for higher superficial liquid velocities. Using the present study data, the Paleev and Filipovich (1966) correlation was found to be the most accurate in predicting entrainment fraction. On the basis of all available data, the Pan and Hanratty (2002b) correlation performed the best in predicting entrainment fraction in all pipe orientations. For vertical annular flow, the Oliemans et al. (1986) correlation predicted entrainment fraction more accurately. The Pan and Hanratty (2002b) correlation was the most accurate in predicting entrainment fraction for horizontal annular flow.

                    "title": "Effects of High Oil Viscosity on Slug Liquid Holdup in Horizontal Pipes",
                    "abstract": "Abstract In the recent years, the increased consumption of hydrocarbon resources and the decline in discoveries of low viscosity oils increased the importance of high viscosity oils. Significant changes in flow behavior were observed with increasing oil viscosity. Determination of the liquid holdup in the slug body is essential to calculate pressure drop for multiphase flow systems.  An experimental study was performed to investigate the effect of high oil viscosity on slug liquid holdup and liquid film height. 144 tests were carried out in 50.8-mm ID horizontal pipe for different oil viscosities and superficial liquid and gas velocities. Tests were conducted at oil viscosities of 0.587, 0.378, 0.257 and 0.181 Pa·s. Superficial liquid and gas velocities varied from 0.1 to 0.8 m/s and 0.1 to 3.5 m/s, respectively. The experimental measurements were compared with the existing slug liquid holdup model predictions to investigate the performances of these models for high viscosity oil.  The predictions of the Gregory et al. (1978), the Gomez et al. (2000), the Abdul-Majeed (2000), the Al-safran (2009) correlations and the Zhang et al. (2003) mechanistic model were compared with high viscosity data. It was concluded that the slug liquid holdup predictions of these empirical and mechanistic models disagree with measurements especially above a 2 m/s mixture velocity. New slug liquid holdup correlations were developed in this study. The new correlations are expected to improve predictions of slug liquid holdup for high viscosity oil especially at high mixture velocities. No significant effect of high oil viscosity on liquid film holdup was observed within the selected oil viscosity range of this study.  Introduction High viscosity oils are produced and transported from many oil reservoirs around the world. It is crucial to design a proper production system in order to eliminate operational problems for high viscosity oil fields. However, available multiphase flow models were primarily developed and validated for low viscosity liquids and large discrepancy happens when applied for high viscosity oils.  The first experimental study at Tulsa University Fluid Flow Projects (TUFFP) on high viscosity oil was completed by Gokcal (2005). The effects of high oil viscosity on oil-gas two-phase flow behavior were investigated and significant changes in flow behavior were observed. Intermitted flow (slug and elongated bubble) is the dominant flow pattern for high viscosity oil and air flow. Slug characteristics need to be examined in detail for better understanding of high liquid viscosity effect.  Experimental Study Experimental Facility An existing TUFFP indoor high viscosity facility has been modified for this study. There are four main parts of the facility: metering section, test section, heating system and cooling system. The test section was designed as an 18.9-m (62-ft) long, 50.8-mm (2-in.) ID pipe consisting of a clear PVC pipe section and a transparent acrylic pipe section. A 9.15-m (30-ft) long transparent acrylic pipe section is used to observe the flow behavior visually.  The test oil viscosity is very sensitive to temperature changes. The temperature measurements are imperative to determine the viscosity of the oil during experiments. Existing heating and cooling systems are used to control temperature. Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) transducers are used to measure temperatures. Pressure transducers and differential pressure transducers are located at various points to monitor the pressure and pressure drop. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract An experimental study has been conducted to investigate high-viscosity oil/water flow in inclined pipes. The pipe inside diameter (ID) is 50.8 mm and pipe inclination angles are -2°, 0°, 5° and 10° from horizontal. The fluids are a mineral oil with a viscosity range of 0.2 - 1.1 Pa·s corresponding to temperatures 60 - 100 °F and filtered tap water. Tulsa city natural gas was used to pressurize the facility to 250 (+20) psig. Superficial oil velocity ranged from 0.1 to 1 m/s and superficial water velocity ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 m/s. Experimental measurements obtained are pressure gradient and water holdup. Pipe viscometer was used to obtain live oil viscosity measurements. Flow patterns were observed through a sapphire window and recorded with a high speed video system. The experimental measurements and observations are used to compare with mechanistic model predictions to identify the deficiencies in the models.  Introduction Global heavy oil and other unconventional oil reserves are estimated to be exceeding conventional oil reserves by a large margin. Conventional oils also exhibit high viscosity at lower temperatures corresponding to cold climate conditions. Mechanistic models are widely used in petroleum industry to predict oil/water flow behavior. These models have been developed and validated based on low-viscosity oil data. This is due to limited experimental data available for high viscosity oil/water flow.  Accurate model predictions of oil/water flow behavior including pressure drop, flow patterns and liquid holdups in pipes of different inclination angles are essential for production system design. The following brief literature review summarizes experimental and modeling work done for oil/water flow.  Trallero (1995) conducted experimental studies of oil/water flow in a 2-in ID horizontal pipe. He observed 6 different flow patterns: stratified flow (ST), stratified with mixing at the interface (ST&MI), dispersion of oil in water over a water layer (DO/W&W), dispersion of oil in water (O/W), dispersion of water in oil (W/O) and dual dispersions (DW/O&DO/W). He also developed a new mechanistic model for oil/water flow pattern transition which performed well for oil/water flow in horizontal pipes.  Several experimental studies of oil/water pipe flow have been conducted including Flores (1997), Angeli et al. (1998), Alkaya (2000), Lum et al. (2004) and Atmaca (2007). These studies cover a wide range of water cuts from 0 to 100% and mixture velocities up to 4 m/s. The test fluids in most cases were mineral oil with viscosities up to 50 cP and tap water. Flow regimes observed varied from stratified flow to dual dispersions. Measurements including pressure drop and holdup were used to validate existing mechanistic models and new models were proposed.  Brauner (2001) developed a unified approach for transition from stratified to dispersed flow patterns in gas-liquid and liquid-liquid systems. It is based on different models predicting maximum drop sizes in dense dispersions. Eötvös number was determined to be the critical dimensionless parameter affecting the range of applicability of these different models. Other dimensionless parameters affecting the transition include Reynolds number, Weber number, flow rates ratio, viscosity ratio and density ratio. "

In this study, oil with viscosity between 0.1 and 0.5 Pa·s (100 and 500 cP) corresponding to temperatures from 37.8 to 15.6 °C (100 to 60 °F) and natural gas at 2.515 MPa (350 psig) pressure are used as the two phases. Superficial oil velocity lies in the range from 0.1 to 1.0 m/s and superficial gas velocity is in the range from 0.5 to 4.0 m/s. The internal diameter of the pipe is 52.5 mm (2.067 in).

The flow pattern and slug characteristics are observed and the images are recorded with a high definition video system through a sapphire window. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of Zhang et al. (2003) unified model and other models, and the gaps are identified.|  Introduction Heavy oil together with extra heavy oil, bitumen and oil sands constitute 70% of oil resources worldwide. High viscosity liquids (0.1-10 Pa·s) produced in petroleum industry include heavy oil, oil produced at low temperatures close to the pour point such as in arctic or offshore environment and emulsions of oil and water. Production of such high viscosity fluids is a challenge. The conventional artificial lift systems must be modified (Dewan and Elfarr 1981; Szucs and Lim 2005). Pumps and gas lift are viable options. Disadvantages of pumps include the cost of the equipment, frequent (1-3 year) well intervention, low efficiency with high gas and sand productions. Gas lift is an attractive alternative and has already been used in Brazil, Canada, fomer Soviet Union, United States and Venezuela (Anderson and Stelzner 1962; Blann et al. 1999; Butler et al. 2000; Dou et al. 2007; Sakharov and Mokhov 2004; Targac et al. 2005; Trindade and Branco 2005). Field experience shows that high viscosity oils require 3-5 times more lifting gas flow rate than conventional oils. Mechanistic models developed for low-viscosity fluids may not be adequate to fully reflect the effect of high fluid viscosity on the performance of gas lift (Schmidt et al. 1984), e.g. the effect on the Taylor bubble behaviors (White and Beardmore 1962) including the slug length and the drift velocity (Gokcal et al. 2009; Sakharov and Mokhov 2004).  High viscosity liquid-gas upward flows in vertical pipes are also of interest in chemical industry. In Schmidt et al., (2008) conducted measurements of void fraction using gamma-densitometer and flow pattern identification with photographs for gas-liquid vertical flow with liquid viscosity ranging 0.7-9.0 Pa·s. Pressure gradient was not reported in their experimental study. Bubble, slug, churn and annular flow patterns were observed. Significant disagreements of void fraction with the existing multiphase correlations were reported. McNeil and Stuart (2003) measured momentum flux, void fraction and pressure distribution at Mach number of 0.4 (mostly annular flow) for liquid viscosities 1-550 cP. Flow patterns were not observed visually and intermittent flow was expected when the load cell vibrated.  Sakharov and Mokhov (2004) observed a new phenomenon of positive frictional pressure gradient in their experiments with high viscosity oils. This behavior appears at low superficial liquid velocity and this region increases with increase of viscosity. Field trials in Komi region showed applicability of gas lifting for high viscosity oils, although in some cases the gas injection caused the oil flow to stop. For industrial applications in Russia, Sakharov and Mokhov developed multiphase correlations applicable to the higher viscosity range. They also presented a new correlation for drift velocity with consideration of viscosity effect.  From literature review very limited experimental results of high viscosity oil-gas flow in vertical pipes have been found (Table 1). In this study, a mineral oil with viscosities between 100 and 500 cP and Tulsa city natural gas at a pressure of 350 psig are used as the two phases. Superficial oil velocity ranges from 0.1 to 1.0 m/s, and superficial gas velocity from 0.5 to 4.0 m/s. The internal diameter of the pipe is 2.067 in. The experimental measurements include pressure gradient and liquid holdup. The flow pattern and slug characteristics are observed and the images are recorded with a high definition video system through a sapphire window. "

Due to complex pump geometries, the direct measurement of αG is very difficult to carry out. In this study, a mechanistic model for predicting the in-situ αG inside an ESP impeller is developed and validated by three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The pressure increment of ESP obtained from single-phase numerical simulations matches experimental measurement well. With a new bubble size prediction model implemented into multiphase CFD simulations, the calculated ESP pressure increments under gassy flow conditions also agree with experimental pump performance curves. As the inlet gas volumetric fraction (GVF) increases, the ESP boosting pressure deteriorates. The simulated in-situ αG, which is used to verify mechanistic model predictions, increases with bubble size increase and gas density or rotational speed decrease. Based on the radial velocity slippage between gas and liquid phases, the in-situ αG can be determined with GVF, rotational speed, bubble size, and fluid properties etc. Compared with empirical correlations, the proposed mechanistic model can predict in-situ αG better by accounting for the gas-liquid phase interaction using the radial force balance between centrifugal buoyancy and drag forces exerted on a stable bubble.

A 3D computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) model is implemented on a three-stage ESP geometry to simulate the pump-pressure increment under various flow conditions. By use of structured hexahedral grids and the frozen-rotor technique, the mesh independence and numerical accuracy are verified. ESP boosting pressure in single-phase simulations is found to match well with experimental data. For two-phase simulations, the Eulerian-Eulerian model is used. At low inlet gas volumetric fractions (GVFs), the numerically simulated pump-pressure increment using constant bubble sizes agrees well with experimental measurements. At higher GVFs, the simulation results deviate from experimental pump-performance curves considerably. By increasing bubble sizes, the simulated ESP performance can be tuned to match experimental results. Through this process, a bubble-size change trend with varying GVFs is obtained. A mechanistic model that is based on the maximum stable bubble in a rotating turbulent flow field is developed to correlate the CFD simulated bubble sizes.

                    "abstract": "Gas entrainment is frequently encountered in crude oil production with electrical submersible pumps (ESP). Previous studies revealed that the increase of gas entrainment rate in ESPs results in mild degradation of boosting pressure followed by a drastic drop. This critical condition, termed as pressure surging, significantly affects ESP's operational stability and run-life. In this paper, the pressure surging phenomenon in ESPs is studied through experimental measurements and mechanistic modeling. A 7.62-cm two-phase flow loop with a 14-stage radial-type ESP is used for testing pump performance under single- and two-phase flow conditions. The stage-by-stage boosting pressure with different gas entrainment rates is measured. Effects of intake pressure, gas volumetric fraction (GVF) and rotational speeds on the ESP two-phase pressure increment are investigated. Experimental results show that the boosting pressure of ESP under gassy flow conditions varies significantly with inlet GVFs and fluid properties. For low GVFs (<6%), the ESP pressure increment deteriorates gradually with the increase of gas flow rate. However, severe degradation of pump boosting pressure is observed if the inlet GVF exceeds a certain value (>7%), which triggers ESP's unstable operations. A mechanistic model based on the critical bubble diameter in rotating multiphase flow field is developed to predict the surging initiation in ESPs.

                    "abstract": "Liquid loading is a common production problem in mature gas wells. As the formation pressure decreases and gas flow rate also decreases, the gas kinetic energy is unable to lift the liquid phase completely to the surface. Liquid starts to accumulate at the bottom of the well, which increases the back pressure of the reservoir. This is reflected in a fluctuated production of liquid and gas rates. At the same time, it significantly reduces the production rate and eventually kills the well. Correct prediction of critical gas velocity at which the well starts to load is very important to the operators since they could take appropriate measures to prevent liquid loading and extend the well production life. In the past, most studies on liquid loading focused on vertical wells. Only recently have a few studies been conducted to deal with the liquid loading for deviated and horizontal wells. To date, there are few published studies discussing how to predict the critical gas velocity across a wide deviation angle range. In fact, there are contradictory conclusions made by different researchers. In this paper a database related to the critical gas velocity is compiled with data from published literature. A new model is developed and evaluated with the experimental data. The gaps in the previous studies and modeling are also discussed. Introduction Gas wells often produce water and other condensate. In the early production stage, the gas flow rate is high enough to carry the produced liquids to the surface. As the reservoir pressure is depleted, the produced gas flow rate decreases until the gas reaches a critical condition at which time the liquid loading is initiated. At the inception of liquid loading, the gas flow rate is not enough to carry the liquid completely to the surface and the liquids start to accumulate at the bottom of the well. Then, the back pressure builds up and the increased reservoir pressure will eventually be sufficient to lift the liquid to the surface. Once the liquid slug is pushed out by the gas, the liquid starts to reload the well again and the cycles are repeated again and again until the well is eventually loaded completely and gas production stops. Accurate prediction of liquid loading in the well is very important to the operators since this will allow them to take the necessary measures to void liquid loading and extend the well production life. The most common liquid loading symptoms observed in the field are pressure (or pressure gradient) fluctuations and reduction of gas production. In general, there are two different liquid loading principles proposed in the literature: liquid droplet fall back and liquid film reversal. The liquid droplet mechanism is based on the falling back of liquid droplets while the liquid film concept is related to the partial or full reversal flow of the liquid film. "

                    "abstract": "Abstract A hilly-terrain pipeline consists of horizontal, upward inclined and downward inclined sections. The lack of understanding of how three-phase slug flow characteristics change in hilly-terrain pipelines may lead to inaccurate modeling of the phenomenon and thus poor pipeline and downstream facility designs. Although several slug tracking models are available, their performance has not been thoroughly tested against gas-oil-water data in hilly-terrain pipelines due to the scarcity of such data.  Three-phase gas-oil-water slug flow evolution in hilly-terrain pipelines was studied experimentally. The constructed experimental facility was a 69-m long, 50.8-mm ID outdoor facility with ±5° inclination angle for a valley configuration. Three-phase slug flow developments in the hilly-terrain section were observed and analyzed with the measured pressure drop, average liquid holdup, phase distributions and slug characteristics. This study improves the current understanding of gas-oil-water flow behavior in hilly-terrain pipelines and the effect of water cut on slug flow characteristics.  This understanding will improve the existing slug tracking models or can be used to develop new models when, necessary, for the proper design and safe operation of three-phase pipeline systems. Seven three-phase slug flow patterns were identified based on oil-water mixture in the upstream horizontal section of the hilly-terrain unit. These flow patterns were analyzed and compared with slug dissipation in the downhill section of the hilly-terrain unit. When these flow patterns were compared with two-phase slug dissipation behavior, no water cut effect was observed. For moderate and high flow rates, slugs with different oil-water mixing status had differences in slug frequencies and lengths. However, the evolution of liquid slug length distributions for 20% and 80% water cuts in the upstream horizontal section and upward inclined section did not show any significant dependence on water cut.  Introduction In the petroleum industry, slug flow is the most complex and dominant flow pattern in horizontal and near-horizontal pipes. Although slug flow in horizontal and inclined pipes has been studied extensively, slug flow in hilly-terrain pipelines which consists of horizontal, upward inclined, and downward inclined sections, is still not completely understood. Some of the most common operational problems hilly-terrain pipeline may cause are terrain slugging, flooding of downstream facilities, pipeline erosion/corrosion and structural instability of the pipeline, as well as production loss and poor reservoir management due to unpredictable wellhead pressures. These challenges become even more difficult as field condition changes with time and three phase gas-oil-water flow dominates. For example, flow assurance problems such as hydrates, emulsions and paraffin deposition. Erosion and corrosion also depend on the characteristics of three-phase flow in pipelines. However, very limited amount of work on three-phase flow has been conducted due to the difficulties of oil-water and gas-liquid flow characterizations.  Since slug flow pattern is such a frequently encountered in three-phase flow, a study of slug flow characteristics for three-phase flow in hilly-terrain pipelines becomes crucial for production and pipeline transportation. However, the complexity of three-phase slug flow makes the experimental measurements and analysis of such data very challenging. This is the reason why three-phase slug flow data is scarce in the literature. Therefore, this study is considered a pioneering research in three-phase slug flow in hilly-terrain pipelines. "

It is discovered and produced around the world and has become one of the most important future hydrocarbon resources with ever increasing world energy demand and depletion of conventional oils. However, heavy oil possesses very high viscosity which poses many challenges for its production and transportation. Accurate pressure gradient and liquid holdup predictions of high-viscosity oil multiphase pipe flows are imperative for heavy oil production and transportation. Most of the current multiphase flow experimental studies, correlation and model developments were conducted using low-viscosity conventional oils or other liquids. However, high-viscosity oil multiphase flow behaves very differently than low-viscosity oil multiphase flow. Significant discrepancies were observed in model comparisons. Slug flow is a dominant flow pattern in high-viscosity oil/gas pipe flow. In two-phase slug flow, liquid slugs and gas pockets propagate alternatively in the pipe. Liquid slugs without gas entrainment are rare under normal pipeline operating conditions. Instead, gas bubbles are often entrained in the liquid slugs. The liquid volume fraction in the slug body is known as the slug liquid holdup. The slugs can carry different amount of entrained gas, which primarily depends on flow rates, fluid properties, and pipe diameter. A slug unit consists of the slug body and a liquid film zone. The fast moving aerated slug body over rides the slow moving liquid film ahead of it. The slug scoops the liquid film and accelerates it to the velocity of the slug (mixture velocity). Liquid is shed from the tail of the slug to a trailing film. Slug liquid holdup is an important parameter for slug flow modeling. Most of the pressure drop in slug flow occurs in the slug body. The frictional pressure drop is greater in the slug body than in the film region. The liquid film acceleration also causes significant pressure drop in the mixing zone at the slug front. Thus the overall pressure gradient depends greatly on the slug liquid holdup and slug length. "

                    "abstract": "The effect of downward and upward pipe inclinations on flow characteristics for high viscosity oil-gas two-phase flow was experimentally studied. 400 experimental tests were conducted in a 50.8-mm ID pipe for ±2° inclinations.  Four different oil viscosities, namely, 0.585, 0.378, 0.257 and 0.181 Pa•s, were considered.  Superficial gas and liquid velocity varied from 0.1 to 3.5 m/s and 0.1 to 0.8 m/s, respectively.  Flow pattern and pressure drop are reported.  The experimental results were used to evaluate different flow pattern maps, models and two-phase flow correlations.  Introduction In oil/gas production and transportation, gas/liquid two-phase flow is frequently observed.  Accurate understanding of two-phase flow characteristics helps in the design and optimum operation of pipeline and downstream facilities. In two-phase flow, flow pattern depends on gas and liquid flow rates, pipe diameter, inclination, and fluid properties.  In near horizontal pipes the flow patterns can be classified as stratified smoth, stratified wavy, slug, elongated bubble, annular and dispersed bubble flow.  Flow parameters such as pressure gradient and liquid holdup are flow pattern dependent.  Thus, systematic studies of the effect of fluid properties, operational condition and pipe geometry is essential for better understanding of two-phase flow behavior. In the past, most of the studies in two-phase flow were carried out for low viscosity liquids (less than 0.02 Pa.s), which generally occur during production of light hydrocarbons.  At present, 60% of the available oil reserves correspond to heavy oils, which possess high density and viscosity.  Additionally, the existing multiphase flow models and correlations were developed using data collected for low viscosity oils with viscosities.  Hence, these models may not be applicable to high viscosity multiphase flow.  The following brief literature review summarizes the most relevant experimental and modeling efforts for two-phase flow in pipes. Sevigny (1962) conducted a comprehensive study of two-phase flow in inclined pipes.  Air and water were the test fluids in 20 mm ID pipe with varying pipe inclinations.  He found that pressure gradients are greatly affected by inclination angles.  Later, Bonnecaze et al. (1971) developed a model for two phase flow in inclined pipeline and claimed that the pressure drop was a strong function of the liquid holdup in the slug unit.  Soon after, Beggs (1972) used a 50.8 and 62.9 mm ID pipe and carried out a study of inclination effects.  He experimentally showed that liquid holdup was strongly affected by pipe inclination angle. Mattar and Gregory (1974) conducted experiments to find the effect of inclination on slug velocity, holdup and pressure gradient.  They found that for uphill pipe sections, slug flow was the predominant flow pattern, and for downhill pipe sections stratified flow dominated.  They also observed that hydrostatic head for slug flow dictated pressure gradient in uphill sections.  Later, Spedding and Chen (1981) experimentally studied the pressure drop in two phase flow in inclined pipe corroborating the relationship between flow pattern and pressure drop.

                    "abstract": "In oil and gas production, the heat transfer process occurs from reservoir porous media to surface facility. Accurate modeling of convective heat transfer coefficient of pipe flow will improve production facility design and help tackle flow assurance problems such as gas hydrates, scale, wax deposition, heavy oil production and transportation. This paper presents a unified gas/oil/water heat transfer model for pipe flow at inclinations from -90° to +90°. It provides a new approach to three-phase pipe flow mechanistic heat transfer modeling. In this approach, three-phase hydrodynamic parameters were calculated first using Zhang and Sarica (2006) unified model. Then, the heat transfer models were developed for gas/oil/water three-phase flow patterns. The phase distributions were described as gas/liquid flow pattern and oil/water mixing status. Energy balance, temperature differences and variations were analyzed for each case. Overall heat transfer coefficients were derived and programmed. To test the program implementation, a synthetic field case was created and run. The temperature prediction was reasonably compared with commercial steady-state and dynamic multiphase flow simulators. The gas/oil/water heat transfer model was then compared with an oil/gas two-phase experimental data from Manabe (2001) for different flow patterns in a 52.5-mm inner diameter pipe from horizontal to upward-vertical inclinations. Overall performance of the present model was good. Convective heat transfer coefficient prediction was within 22% absolute average relative error. Mixture temperature was predicted within 1.5% absolute average relative error. After comparing with two-phase flow data, sensitivity of heat transfer coefficient to water cut was analyzed by changing the water cut from 0.0 to 1.0 under different flow conditions. Predicted convective heat transfer coefficient was sensitive to flow pattern, water cut and flow rate changes. Generally, the predicted convective heat transfer coefficient increases as water cut increases for the same flow pattern. "

                    "abstract": "Gas entrainment is frequently encountered in electrical submersible pump (ESP) as an artificial lift method for oil production. When this occurs, ESP suffers from moderate to serve performance degradation depending on inlet gas volumetric fraction (GVF). The resulted pressure surging may cause vibrations and short run-life of ESPs. For better design of ESP system, a mechanistic model is needed to accurately predict its performance with gas-liquid flow. Similar to modeling multiphase pipe flow, the flow pattern identification and classification inside a rotating ESP is thus of great importance. In this paper, we propose a new mechanistic model to map flow patterns in ESP operated under gassy flow conditions. The model is validated by comparing to experimental results with good agreement. The experimental facility for testing ESP two-phase performance was designed and constructed. The main flow loop comprises a 3\" stainless steel liquid flow loop and V\" gas flow loop. A radial-type ESP with 14 stages assembled in series is horizontally mounted on a testing bench. Pressure ports were drilled at each stage to measure stage-by-stage pump pressure increment. The mixture of gas and liquid is separated in a horizontal separator, where excessive air is vented and liquid continues circulation. Experimental data are acquired with two types of tests (mapping and surging tests) to completely evaluate the pump behaviors at different operational conditions. The water/gas flow rates, ESP rotational speeds, intake pressure and surfactant concentrations are controlled in the experiments. For two-phase flow, ESP pressure increment suffers from more severe degradation as gas flow rate increases. With the performance curves obtained in surging or mapping tests, ESP flow patterns including dispersed bubble flow, bubbly flow, intermittent flow and segregated flow can be identified. The pattern transition boundaries are mapped. Starting from the free body diagram on a stable single bubble, the transition boundaries of dispersed bubble flow to bubbly flow and bubbly flow to intermittent flow are formulated. Based on the combined momentum equation, the transition criterion of intermittent flow to segregated flow is derived. The flow pattern map calculated from the new mechanistic model agrees well with that detected from ESP performance curves. "

A transient heat transfer model is also developed to estimate the temperature profile along the production system. The black oilmodel is added to calculate the fluid properties at each time step.Several methods were developed in the past to predict flow instabilities. However, they are designed for specific transient behavior and they can only predict whether or not the flow is unstable. They cannot quantify how unstable it will be. The present model can predict the detailed multiphase flow hydrodynamic behaviors including pressure, temperature, local flow pattern, liquid holdup, and fluid velocities. The model is validated through comparisons with experimental results and field data. "

                    "title": "Generalized Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) for Horizontal Wells",
                    "abstract": "The horizontal well technology can solve different problems of production from tight formations where conventional technology fails. The aim of this study is to develop a generalized IPR for an oil reservoir in which a well is drilled horizontally. A reservoir simulator is used to simulate the production through this well to construct the IPR curves. A simulation matrix is designed by changing well geometry, well position and rock properties. The IPR data obtained from the numerical simulations are fitted to a Vogel-type relationship and the values of the coefficient, b, are calculated corresponding to different conditions. Consequently, a statistical analysis method is used to determine which factors in the simulation matrix have a significant effect on the value of b. The results show that the only significant factor is the vertical to horizontal permeability ratio of the reservoir. Using the Vogel-type IPR and the correlation for b obtained from statistical analysis in terms of the vertical to horizontal permeability ratio, an IPR suitable for horizontal well productivity is developed taking into account the reservoir and well parameters. In this relationship, the factor b is a function of the vertical to horizontal permeability ratio.  The new model is tested against random simulations that are not included in the original simulation matrix for the model development, and better agreement is observed compared to the predictions of previous IPR's available in the literature. Introduction Horizontal drilling has gone mainstream since its introduction in the petroleum industry. Today most wells are drilled horizontally especially in unconventional plays. For instance, 85% of the wells drilled in Haynesville shale are horizontal while only 15% are vertical, Shadravan and Amani (2012).This will maximize the well contact area with the reservoir and; thereby, the productivity index. This means that all the traditional methods used in analyzing the productivity of the reservoir with mainly vertical wells drilled in them may have to be modified, if not reconstructed from the fundamentals. One prediction method for the reservoir inflow performance is the Vogel approach, which uses two constants for a linear and quadratic term. This IPR, and all the modified versions that came after it, have proven to match the reservoir data with acceptable accuracy. Vogel (1968) used a computer program for analyzing the inflow performance relationship of flowing oil wells in solution gas drive reservoirs. His method was based on Weller's approximation for solution gas drive wells including different crude oil characteristics, the effect of well spacing, fracturing, and skin restrictions. Vogel's correlation needs only one production test to construct the IPR curve. However, it will not give a good prediction of IPR at later stages of reservoir compared with IPR at early stages. Fetkovich (1973) developed a model for predicting IPR based on the data from multi-rate tests. His model was developed for vertical wells and may not be appropriate for horizontal wells. Klins and Majcher (1992) investigated inflow performance relationships for damaged or stimulated wells producing under solution gas drive. This IPR was developed from about 19500 data points. In their model, bubble point pressure and reservoir depletion had a significant effect on the IPR curves. "
